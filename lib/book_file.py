Nadar, a Frenchman, which had a capacity of 215,000 cubic feet and required for a covering 22,000 yards of silk.", "It ascended from the Champ de Mars, Paris, in 1853, with fifteen passengers, all of whom came back safely.", "The longest flight made in a balloon was that by Count de La Vaulx, 1193 miles in 1905.", "A mammoth balloon was built in London by A. E. Gaudron.", "In 1908 with three other aeronauts Gaudron crossed from the Crystal Palace to the Belgian Coast at Ostend and then drifted over Northern Germany and was finally driven down by a snow storm at Mateki Derevni in Russia, having traveled 1,117 miles in 31 1/2 hours.", "The first attempt at constructing a dirigible balloon or airship was made by M. Giffard, a Frenchman, in 1852.", "The bag was spindle shaped and 144 feet from point to point.", "Though it could be steered without drifting the motor was too weak to propel it.", "Giffard had many imitations in the spindle shaped envelope construction, but it was a long time before any good results were obtained.", "It was not until 1884 that M. Gaston Tissandier constructed a dirigible in any way worthy of the name.", "It was operated by a motor driven by a bichromate of soda battery.", "The motor weighed 121 lbs.", "The cells held liquid enough to work for 2 1/2 hours, generating 1 1/3 horse power.", "The screw had two arms and was over nine feet in circumference.", "Tissandier made some successful flights.", "The first dirigible balloon to return whence it started was that known as _La France_.", "This airship was also constructed in 1884.", "The designer was Commander Renard of the French Marine Corps assisted by Captain Krebs of the same service.", "The length of the envelope was 179 feet, its diameter 27 1/2 feet.", "The screw was in front instead of behind as in all others previously constructed.", "The motor which weighed 220 1/2 lbs.", "was driven by electricity and developed 8 1/2 horse power.", "The propeller was 24 feet in diameter and only made 46 revolutions to the minute.", "This was the first time electricity was used as a motor force, and mighty possibilities were conceived.", "In 1901 a young Brazilian, Santos Dumont, made a spectacular flight.", "M. Deutch, a Parisian millionaire, offered a prize of $20,000 for the first dirigible that would fly from the Parc d'Aerostat, encircle the Eiffel Tower and return to the starting point within thirty minutes, the distance of such flight being about nine miles.", "Dumont won the prize though he was some forty seconds over time.", "The length of his dirigible on this occasion was 108 feet, the diameter 19 1/2 feet.", "It had a 4 cylinder petroleum motor weighing 216 lbs., which generated 20 horse power.", "The screw was 13 feet in diameter and made three hundred revolutions to the minute.", "From this time onward great progress was made in the constructing of airships.", "Government officials and many others turned their attention to the work.", "Factories were put in operation in several countries of Europe and by the year 1905 the dirigible had been fairly well established.", "Zeppelin, Parseval, Lebaudy, Baidwin and Gross were crowding one another for honors.", "All had given good results, Zeppelin especially had performed some remarkable feats with his machines.", "In the construction of the dirigible balloon great care must be taken to build a strong, as well as light framework and to suspend the car from it so that the weight will be equally distributed, and above all, so to contrive the gas contained that under no circumstances can it become tilted.", "There is great danger in the event of tilting that some of the stays suspending the car may snap and the construction fall to pieces in the air.", "In deciding upon the shape of a dirigible balloon the chief consideration is to secure an end surface which presents the least possible resistance to the air and also to secure stability and equilibrium.", "Of course the motor, fuel and propellers are other considerations of vital importance.", "The first experimenter on the size of wing surface necessary to sustain a man in the air, calculated from the proportion of weight and wing surface in birds, was Karl Meerwein of Baden.", "He calculated that a man weighing 200 lbs.", "would require 128 square feet.", "In 1781 he made a spindle shaped apparatus presenting such a surface to the resistance of the air.", "It was collapsible on the middle and here the operator was fastened and lay horizontally with his face towards the earth working the collapsible wings by means of a transverse rod.", "It was not a success.", "During the first half of the 19th Century there were many experiments with wing surfaces, none of which gave any promise.", "In fact it was not until 1865 that any advance was made, when Francis Wenham showed that the lifting power of a plane of great superficial area could be obtained by dividing the large plane into several parts arranged on tiers.", "This may be regarded as the germ of the modern aeroplane, the first glimmer of hope to filter through the darkness of experimentation until then.", "When Wenham's apparatus went against a strong wind it was only lifted up and thrown back.", "However, the idea gave thought to many others years afterwards.", "In 1885 the brothers Lilienthal in Germany discovered the possibility of driving curved aeroplanes against the wind.", "Otto Lilienthal held that it was necessary to begin with \"sailing\" flight and first of all that the art of balancing in the air must be learned by practical experiments.", "He made several flights of the kind now known as _gliding_.", "From a height of 100 feet he glided a distance of 700 feet and found he could deflect his flight from left to right by moving his legs which were hanging freely from the seat.", "He attached a light motor weighing only 96 lbs.", "and generating 2 1/2 horse power.", "To sustain the weight he had to increase the size of his planes.", "Unfortunately this pioneer in modern aviation was killed in an experiment, but he left much data behind which has helped others.", "His was the first actual flyer which demonstrated the elementary laws governing real flight and blazed the way for the successful experiments of the present time.", "His example made the gliding machine a continuous performance until real practical aerial flight was achieved.", "As far back as 1894 Maxim built a giant aeroplane but it was too cumbersome to be operated.", "In America the wonderful work of Professor Langley of the Smithsonian Institution with his aerodromes attracted worldwide attention.", "Langley was the great originator of the science of aerodynamics on this side of the water.", "Langley studied from artificial birds which he had constructed and kept almost constantly before him.", "To Langley, Chanute, Herring and Manly, America owes much in the way of aeronautics before the Wrights entered the field.", "The Wrights have given the greatest impetus to modern aviation.", "They entered the field in 1900 and immediately achieved greater results than any of their predecessors.", "They followed the idea of Lilienthal to a certain extent.", "They made gliders in which the aviator had a horizontal position and they used twice as great a lifting surface as that hitherto employed.", "The flights of their first motor machine was made December 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, N.C.", "In 1904 with a new machine they resumed experiments at their home near Dayton, O. In September of that year they succeeded in changing the course from one dead against the wind to a curved path where cross currents must be encountered, and made many circular flights.", "During 1906 they rested for a while from practical flight, perfecting plans for the future.", "In the beginning of September, 1908, Orville Wright made an aeroplane flight of one hour, and a few days later stayed up one hour and fourteen minutes.", "Wilbur Wright went to France and began a series of remarkable flights taking up passengers.", "On December 31, of that year, he startled the world by making the record flight of two hours and nineteen minutes.", "It was on Sept.", "13, 1906, that Santos Dumont made the first officially recorded European aeroplane flight, leaving the ground for a distance of 12 yards.", "On November 12, of same year, he remained in the air for 21 seconds and traveled a distance of 230 yards.", "These feats caused a great sensation at the time.", "While the Wrights were achieving fame for America, Henri Farman was busy in England.", "On October 26, 1907, he flew 820 yards in 52 1/2 seconds.", "On July 6, 1908, he remained in the air for 20 1/2 minutes.", "On October 31, same year, in France, he flew from Chalons to Rheims, a distance of sixteen miles, in twenty minutes.", "The year 1909 witnessed mighty strides in the field of aviation.", "Thousands of flights were made, many of which exceeded the most sanguine anticipations.", "On July 13, Bleriot flew from Etampes to Chevilly, 26 miles, in 44 minutes and 30 seconds, and on July 25 he made the first flight across the British Channel, 32 miles, in 37 minutes.", "Orville Wright made several sensational flights in his biplane around Berlin, while his brother Wilbur delighted New Yorkers by circling the Statue of Liberty and flying up the Hudson from Governor's Island to Grant's Tomb and return, a distance of 21 miles, in 33 minutes and 33 seconds during the Hudson Fulton Celebration.", "On November 20 Louis Paulhan, in a biplane, flew from Mourmelon to Chalons, France, and return, 37 miles in 55 minutes, rising to a height of 1000 feet.", "The dirigible airship was also much in evidence during 1909, Zeppelin, especially, performing some remarkable feats.", "The Zeppelin V., subsequently re numbered No.", "1, of the rigid type, 446 feet long, diameter 42 1/2 feet and capacity 536,000 cubic feet, on March 29, rose to a height of 3,280, and on April 1, started with a crew of nine passengers from Frederickshafen to Munich.", "In a 35 mile gale it was carried beyond Munich, but Zeppelin succeeded in coming to anchor.", "Other Zeppelin balloons made remarkable voyages during the year.", "But the latest achievements (1910) of the old German aeronaut have put all previous records into the shade and electrified the whole world.", "His new passenger airship, the _Deutschland_, on June 22, made a 300 mile trip from Frederickshafen to Dusseldorf in 9 hours, carrying 20 passengers.", "This was at the rate of 33.33 miles per hour.", "During one hour of the journey a speed of 43 1/2 miles was averaged.", "The passengers were carried in a mahogany finished cabin and had all the comforts of a Pullman car, but most significant fact of all, the trip was made on schedule and with all regularity of an express train.", "Two days later Zeppelin eclipsed his own record air voyage when his vessel carried 32 passengers, ten of whom were women, in a 100 mile trip from Dusseldorf to Essen, Dortmund and Bochum and back.", "At one time on this occasion while traveling with the wind the airship made a speed of 56 1/2 miles.", "It passed through a heavy shower and forced its way against a strong headwind without difficulty.", "The passengers were all delighted with the new mode of travel, which was very comfortable.", "This last dirigible masterpiece of Zeppelin may be styled the leviathan of the air.", "It is 485 feet long with a total lifting power of 44,000 lbs.", "It has three motors which total 330 horse power and it drives at an average speed of about 33 miles an hour.", "A regular passenger service has been established and tickets are selling at $50.", "The present year can also boast some great aeroplane records, notably by Curtiss and Hamilton in America and Farman and Paulhan in Europe.", "Curtiss flew from Albany to New York, a distance of 137 miles, at an average speed of 55 miles an hour and Hamilton flew from New York to Philadelphia and return.", "The first night flight of a dirigible over New York City was made by Charles Goodale on July 19.", "He flew from Palisades Park on the Hudson and return.", "From a scientific toy the Flying Machine has been developed and perfected into a practical means of locomotion.", "It bids fair at no distant date to revolutionize the transit of the world.", "No other art has ever made such progress in its early stages and every day witnesses an improvement.", "The air, though invisible to the eye, has mass and therefore offers resistance to all moving bodies.", "Therefore air mass and air resistance are the first principles to be taken into consideration in the construction of an aeroplane.", "It must be built so that the air mass will sustain it and the motor, and the motor must be of sufficient power to overcome the air resistance.", "A ship ploughing through the waves presents the line of least resistance to the water and so is shaped somewhat like a fish, the natural denizen of that element.", "It is different with the aeroplane.", "In the intangible domain it essays to overcome, there must be a sufficient surface to compress a certain volume of air to sustain the weight of the machinery.", "The surfaces in regard to size, shape, curvature, bracing and material, are all important.", "A great deal depends upon the curve of the surfaces.", "Two machines may have the same extent of surface and develop the same rate of speed, yet one may have a much greater lifting power than the other, provided it has a more efficient curve to its surface.", "Many people have a fallacious idea that the surfaces of an aeroplane are planes and this doubt less arises from the word itself.", "However, the last syllable in _aeroplane_ has nothing whatever to do with a flat surface.", "It is derived from the Greek _planos_, wandering, therefore the entire word signifies an air wanderer.", "The surfaces are really aero curves arched in the rear of the front edge, thus allowing the supporting surface of the aeroplane in passing forward with its backward side set at an angle to the direction of its motion, to act upon the air in such a way as to tend to compress it on the under side.", "After the surfaces come the rudders in importance.", "It is of vital consequence that the machine be balanced by the operator.", "In the present method of balancing an aeroplane the idea in mind is to raise the lower side of the machine and make the higher side lower in order that it can be quickly righted when it tips to one side from a gust of wind, or when making angle at a sudden turn.", "To accomplish this, two methods can be employed.", "1.", "Changing the form of the wing.", "2.", "Using separate surfaces.", "One side can be made to lift more than the other by giving it a greater curve or extending the extremity.", "In balancing by means of separate surfaces, which can be turned up or down on each side of the machine, the horizontal balancing rudders are so connected that they will work in an opposite direction  while one is turned to lift one side, the other will act to lower the other side so as to strike an even balance.", "The motors and propellers next claim attention.", "It is the motor that makes aviation possible.", "It was owing in a very large measure to the introduction of the petrol motor that progress became rapid.", "Hitherto many had laid the blame of everything on the motor.", "They had said,  \"give us a light and powerful engine and we will show you how to fly.\"", "The first very light engine to be available was the _Antoinette_, built by Leon Levavasseur in France.", "It enabled Santos Dumont to make his first public successful flights.", "Nearly all aeroplanes follow the same general principles of construction.", "Of course a good deal depends upon the form of aeroplane  whether a monoplane or a biplane.", "As these two forms are the chief ones, as yet, of heavier than air machines, it would be well to understand them.", "The monoplane has single large surfaces like the wings of a bird, the biplane has two large surfaces braced together one over the other.", "At the present writing a triplane has been introduced into the domain of American aviation by an English aeronaut.", "Doubtless as the science progresses many other variations will appear in the field.", "Most machines, though fashioned on similar lines, possess universal features.", "For instance, the Wright biplane is characterized by warping wing tips and seams of heavy construction, while the surfaces of the Herring Curtiss machine, are slight and it looks very light and buoyant as if well suited to its element.", "The Voisin biplane is fashioned after the manner of a box kite and therefore presents vertical surfaces to the air.", "Farman's machine has no vertical surfaces, but there are hinged wing tips to the outer rear edges of its surfaces, for use in turning and balancing.", "He also has a combination of wheels and skids or runners for starting and landing.", "The position to be occupied by the operator also influences the construction.", "Some sit on top of the machine, others underneath.", "In the _Antoinette_, Latham sits up in a sort of cockpit on the top.", "Bleriot sits far beneath his machine.", "In the latest construction of Santos Dumont, the _Demoiselle_, the aviator sits on the top.", "Aeroplanes have been constructed for the most part in Europe, especially in France.", "There may be said to be only one factory in America, that of Herring Curtiss, at Hammondsport, N.Y., as the Wright place at Dayton is very small and only turns out motors and experimenting machines, and cannot be called a regular factory.", "The Wright machines are now manufactured by a French syndicate.", "It is said that the Wrights will have an American factory at work in a short time.", "The French made aeroplanes have given good satisfaction.", "These machines cost from $4,000 to $5,000, and generally have three cylinder motors developing from 25 to 35 horse power.", "The latest model of Bleriot known as No.", "12 has beaten the time record of Glenn Curtiss' biplane with its 60 horse power motor.", "The Farman machine or the model in which he made the world's duration record in his three hour and sixteen minutes flight at Rheims, is one of the best as well as the cheapest of the French makes.", "Without the motor it cost but $1,200.", "It has a surface twenty five meters square, is eight meters long and seven and a half meters wide, weighs 140 kilos, and has a motor which develops from 25 to 50 horse power.", "The Wright machines cost $6,000.", "They have four cylinder motors of 30 horse power, are 12 1/2 meters long, 9 meters wide and have a surface of 30 square meters.", "They weigh 400 kilos.", "In this country they cost $7,500 exclusive of the duty on foreign manufacture.", "The impetus being given to aviation at the present time by the prizes offered is spurring the men birds to their best efforts.", "It is prophesied that the aeroplane will yet attain a speed of 300 miles an hour.", "The quickest travel yet attained by man has been at the rate of 127 miles an hour.", "That was accomplished by Marriott in a racing automobile at Ormond Beach in 1906, when he went one mile in 28 1 5 seconds.", "It is doubtful, however, were it possible to achieve a rate of 300 miles an hour, that any human being could resist the air pressure at such a velocity.", "At any rate there can be no question as to the aeroplane attaining a much greater speed than at present.", "That it will be useful there can be little doubt.", "It is no longer a scientific toy in the hands of amateurs, but a practical machine which is bound to contribute much to the progress of the world.", "Of course, as a mode of transportation it is not in the same class with the dirigible, but it can be made to serve many other purposes.", "As an agent in time of war it would be more important than fort or warship.", "The experiments of Curtiss, made a short time ago over Lake Keuka at Hammondsport, N.Y., prove what a mighty factor would have to be reckoned with in the martial aeroplane.", "Curtiss without any practice at all hit a mimic battle ship fifteen times out of twenty two shots.", "His experiment has convinced the military and naval authorities of this country that the aeroplane and the aerial torpedo constitute a new danger against which there is no existing protection.", "Aerial offensive and defensive strategy is now a problem which demands the attention of nations.", "CHAPTER II  WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY    Primitive Signalling  Principles of Wireless Telegraphy  Ether   Vibrations  Wireless Apparatus  The Marconi System.", "At a very early stage in the world's history, man found it necessary to be able to communicate with places at a distance by means of signals.", "Fire was the first agent employed for the purpose.", "On hill tops or other eminences, what were known as beacon fires were kindled and owing to their elevation these could be seen for a considerable distance throughout the surrounding country.", "These primitive signals could be passed on from one point to another, until a large region could be covered and many people brought into communication with one another.", "These fires expressed a language of their own, which the observers could readily interpret.", "For a long time they were the only method used for signalling.", "Indeed in many backward localities and in some of the outlying islands and among savage tribes the custom still prevails.", "The bushmen of Australia at night time build fires outside their huts or kraals to attract the attention of their followers.", "Even in enlightened Ireland the kindling of beacon fires is still observed among the people of backward districts especially on May Eve and the festival of mid summer.", "On these occasions bonfires are lit on almost every hillside throughout that country.", "This custom has been handed down from the days of the Druids.", "For a long time fires continued to be the mode of signalling, but as this way could only be used in the night, it was found necessary to adopt some method that would answer the purpose in daytime; hence signal towers were erected from which flags were waved and various devices displayed.", "Flags answered the purposes so very well that they came into general use.", "In course of time they were adopted by the army, navy and merchant marine and a regular code established, as at the present time.", "The railroad introduced the semaphore as a signal, and field tactics the heliograph or reflecting mirror which, however, is only of service when there is a strong sunlight.", "Then came the electric telegraph which not only revolutionized all forms of signalling but almost annihilated distance.", "Messages and all sorts of communications could be flashed over the wires in a few minutes and when a cable was laid under the ocean, continent could converse with continent as if they were next door neighbors.", "The men who first enabled us to talk over a wire certainly deserve our gratitude, all succeeding generations are their debtors.", "To the man who enabled us to talk to long distances without a wire at all it would seem we owe a still greater debt.", "But who is this man around whose brow we should twine the laurel wreath, to the altar of whose genius we should carry frankincense and myrrh?", "This is a question which does not admit of an answer, for to no one man alone do we owe wireless telegraphy, though Hertz was the first to discover the waves which make it possible.", "However, it is to the men whose indefatigable labors and genius made the electric telegraph a reality, that we also owe wireless telegraphy as we have it at present, for the latter may be considered in many respects the resultant of the former, though both are different in medium.", "Radio or wireless telegraphy in principle is as old as mankind.", "Adam delivered the first wireless when on awakening in the Garden of Eden he discovered Eve and addressed her in the vernacular of Paradise in that famous sentence which translated in English reads both ways the same,  \"Madam, I'm Adam.\"", "The oral words issuing from his lips created a sound wave which the medium of the air conveyed to the tympanum of the partner of his joys and the cause of his sorrows.", "When one person speaks to another the speaker causes certain vibrations in the air and these so stimulate the hearing apparatus that a series of nerve impulses are conveyed to the sensorium where the meaning of these signals is unconsciously interpreted.", "In wireless telegraphy the sender causes vibrations not in the air but in that all pervading impalpable substance which fills all space and which we call the ether.", "These vibrations can reach out to a great distance and are capable of so affecting a receiving apparatus that signals are made, the movements of which can be interpreted into a distinct meaning and consequently into the messages of language.", "Let us briefly consider the underlying principles at work.", "When we cast a stone into a pool of water we observe that it produces a series of ripples which grow fainter and fainter the farther they recede from the centre, the initial point of the disturbance, until they fade altogether in the surrounding expanse of water.", "The succession of these ripples is what is known as _wave_ motion.", "When the clapper strikes the lip of a bell it produces a sound and sends a tremor out upon the air.", "The vibrations thus made are air waves.", "In the first of these cases the medium communicating the ripple or wavelet is the water.", "In the second case the medium which sustains the tremor and communicates the vibrations is the air.", "Let us now take the case of a third medium, the substance of which puzzled the philosophers of ancient time and still continues to puzzle the scientists of the present.", "This is the ether, that attenuated fluid which fills all inter stellar space and all space in masses and between molecules and atoms not otherwise occupied by gross matter.", "When a lamp is lit the light radiates from it in all directions in a wave motion.", "That which transmits the light, the medium, is ether.", "By this means energy is conveyed from the sun to the earth, and scientists have calculated the speed of the ether vibrations called light at 186,400 miles per second.", "Thus a beam of light can travel from the sun to the earth, a distance of between 92,000,000 and 95,000,000 miles (according to season), in a little over eight minutes.", "The fire messages sent by the ancients from hill to hill were ether vibrations.", "The greater the fires, the greater were the vibrations and consequently they carried farther to the receiver, which was the eye.", "If a signal is to be sent a great distance by light the source of that light must be correspondingly powerful in order to disturb the ether sufficiently.", "The same principle holds good in wireless telegraphy.", "If we wish to communicate to a great distance the ether must be disturbed in proportion to the distance.", "The vibrations that produce light are not sufficient in intensity to affect the ether in such a way that signals can be carried to a distance.", "Other disturbances, however, can be made in the ether, stronger than those which create light.", "If we charge a wire with an electric current and place a magnetic needle near it we find it moves the needle from one position to another.", "This effect is called an electro magnetic disturbance in the ether.", "Again when we charge an insulated body with electricity we find that it attracts any light substance indicating a material disturbance in the ether.", "This is described as an electro static disturbance or effect and it is upon this that wireless telegraphy depends for its operations.", "The late German physicist, Dr.", "Heinrich Hertz, Ph.D., was the first to detect electrical waves in the ether.", "He set up the waves in the ether by means of an electrical discharge from an induction coil.", "To do this he employed a very simple means.", "He procured a short length of wire with a brass knob at either end and bent around so as to form an almost complete circle leaving only a small air gap between the knobs.", "Each time there was a spark discharge from the induction coil, the experimenter found that a small electric spark also generated between the knobs of the wire loop, thus showing that electric waves were projected through the ether.", "This discovery suggested to scientists that such electric waves might be used as a means of transmitting signals to a distance through the medium of the ether without connecting wires.", "When Hertz discovered that electric waves crossed space he unconsciously became the father of the modern system of radio telegraphy, and though he did not live to put or see any practical results from his wonderful discovery, to him in a large measure should be accorded the honor of blazoning the way for many of the intellectual giants who came after him.", "Of course those who went before him, who discovered the principles of the electric telegraph made it possible for the Hertzian waves to be utilized in wireless.", "It is easy to understand the wonders of wireless telegraphy when we consider that electric waves transverse space in exactly the same manner as light waves.", "When energy is transmitted with finite velocity we can think of its transference only in two ways  first by the actual transference of matter as when a stone is hurled from one place to another; second, by the propagation of energy from point to point through a medium which fills the space between two bodies.", "The body sending out energy disturbs the medium contiguous to it, which disturbance is communicated to adjacent parts of the medium and so the movement is propagated outward from the sending body through the medium until some other body is affected.", "A vibrating body sets up vibrations in another body, as for instance, when one tuning fork responds to the vibrations of another when both have the same note or are in tune.", "The transmission of messages by wireless telegraphy is effected in a similar way.", "The apparatus at the sending station sends out waves of a certain period through the ether and these waves are detected at the receiving station, by apparatus attuned to this wave length or period.", "The term electric radiation was first employed by Hertz to designate waves emitted by a Leyden jar or oscillator system of an induction coil, but since that time these radiations have been known as Hertzian waves.", "These waves are the underlying principles in wireless telegraphy.", "It was found that certain metal filings offered great resistance to the passage of an electric current through them but that this resistance was very materially reduced when electric waves fell upon the filings and remained so until the filings were shaken, thus giving time for the fact to be observed in an ordinary telegraphic instrument.", "The tube of filings through which the electric current is made to pass in wireless telegraphy is called a coherer signifying that the filings cohere or cling together under the influence of the electric waves.", "Almost any metal will do for the filings but it is found that a combination of ninety per cent.", "nickel and ten per cent.", "silver answers the purpose best.", "The tube of the coherer is generally of glass but any insulating substance will do; a wire enters at each end and is attached to little blocks of metal which are separated by a very small space.", "It is into this space the filings are loosely filled.", "Another form of coherer consists of a glass tube with small carbon blocks or plugs attached to the ends of the wires and instead of the metal filings there is a globule of mercury between the plugs.", "When electric waves fall upon this coherer, the mercury coheres to the carbon blocks, and thus forms a bridge for the battery current.", "Marconi and several others have from time to time invented many other kinds of detectors for the electrical waves.", "Nearly all have to serve the same purpose, viz., to close a local battery circuit when the electric waves fall upon the detector.", "There are other inventions on which the action is the reverse.", "These are called anti coherers.", "One of the best known of these is a tube arranged in a somewhat similar manner to the filings tube but with two small blocks of tin, between which is placed a paste made up of alcohol, tin filings and lead oxide.", "In its normal state the paste allows the battery current to get across from one block to another, but when electric waves touch it a chemical action is produced which immediately breaks down the bridge and stops the electric waves, the paste resumes its normal condition and allows the battery current to pass again.", "Therefore by this arrangement the signals are made by a sudden breaking and making of the battery circuit.", "Then there is the magnetic detector.", "This is not so easy of explanation.", "When we take a piece of soft iron and continuously revolve it in front of a permanent magnet, the magnetic poles of the soft iron piece will keep changing their position at each half revolution.", "It requires a little time to effect this magnetic change which makes it appear as if a certain amount of resistance was being made against it.", "(If electric waves are allowed to fall upon the iron, resistance is completely eliminated, and the magnetic poles can change places instantly as it revolves.)", "From this we see that if we have a quickly changing magnetic field it will induce or set up an electric current in a neighboring coil of wire.", "In this way we can detect the changes in the magnetic field, for we can place a telephone receiver in connection with the coil of wire.", "In a modern wireless receiver of this kind it is found more convenient to replace the revolving iron piece by an endless band of soft iron wire.", "This band is kept passing in front of a permanent magnet, the magnetism of the wire tending to change as it passes from one pole to the other.", "This change takes place suddenly when the electric waves form the transmitting station, fall upon the receiving aerial conductor and are conducted round the moving wire, and as the band is passing through a coil of insulated wire attached to a telephone receiver, this sudden change in the magnetic field induces an electric current in the surrounding coil and the operator hears a sound in the telephone at his ear.", "The Morse code may thus be signalled from the distant transmitter.", "There are various systems of wireless telegraphy for the most part called after the scientists who developed or perfected them.", "Probably the foremost as well as the best known is that which bears the name of Marconi.", "A popular fallacy makes Marconi the discoverer of the wireless method.", "Marconi was the first to put the system on a commercial footing or business basis and to lead the way for its coming to the front as a mighty factor in modern progress.", "Of course, also, the honor of several useful inventions and additions to wireless apparatus must be given him.", "He started experimenting as far back as 1895 when but a mere boy.", "In the beginning he employed the induction coil, Morse telegraph key, batteries, and vertical wire for the transmission of signals, and for their reception the usual filings coherer of nickel with a very small percentage of silver, a telegraph relay, batteries and a vertical wire.", "In the Marconi system of the present time there are many forms of coherers, also the magnetic detector and other variations of the original apparatus.", "Other systems more or less prominent are the Lodge Muirhead of England, Braun Siemens of Germany and those of DeForest and Fessenden of America.", "The electrolytic detector with the paste between the tin blocks belongs to the system of DeForest.", "Besides these the names of Popoff, Jackson, Armstrong, Orling, Lepel, and Poulsen stand high in the wireless world.", "A serious drawback to the operations of wireless lies in the fact that the stations are liable to get mixed up and some one intercept the messages intended for another, but this is being overcome by the adoption of a special system of wave lengths for the different wireless stations and by the use of improved apparatus.", "In the early days it was quite a common occurrence for the receivers of one system to reply to the transmitters of a rival system.", "There was an all round mix up and consequently the efficiency of wireless for practical purposes was for a good while looked upon with more or less suspicion.", "But as knowledge of wave motions developed and the laws of governing them were better understood, the receiver was \"tuned\" to respond to the transmitter, that is, the transmitter was made to set up a definite rate of vibrations in the ether and the receiver made to respond to this rate, just like two tuning forks sounding the same note.", "In order to set up as energetic electric waves as possible many methods have been devised at the transmitting stations.", "In some methods a wire is attached to one of the two metal spheres between which the electric charge takes place and is carried up into the air for a great height, while to the second sphere another wire is connected and which leads into the earth.", "Another method is to support a regular network of wires from strong steel towers built to a height of two hundred feet or more.", "Long distance transmission by wireless was only made possible by grounding one of the conductors in the transmitter.", "The Hertzian waves were provided without any earth connection and radiated into space in all directions, rapidly losing force like the disappearing ripples on a pond, whereas those set up by a grounded transmitter with the receiving instrument similarly connected to earth, keep within the immediate neighborhood of the earth.", "For instance up to about two hundred miles a storage battery and induction coil are sufficient to produce the necessary ether disturbance, but when a greater distance is to be spanned an engine and a dynamo are necessary to supply energy for the electric waves.", "In the most recent Marconi transmitter the current produced is no longer in the form of intermittent sparks, but is a true alternating current, which in general continues uniformly as long as the key is pressed down.", "There is no longer any question that wireless telegraphy is here to stay.", "It has passed the juvenile stage and is fast approaching a lusty adolescence which promises to be a source of great strength to the commerce of the world.", "Already it has accomplished much for its age.", "It has saved so many lives at sea that its installation is no longer regarded as a scientific luxury but a practical necessity on every passenger vessel.", "Practically every steamer in American waters is equipped with a wireless station.", "Even freight boats and tugs are up to date in this respect.", "Every ship in the American navy, including colliers and revenue cutters, carries wireless operators.", "So important indeed is it considered in the Navy department that a line of shore stations have been constructed from Maine on the Atlantic to Alaska on the Pacific.", "In a remarkably short interval wireless has come to exercise an important function in the marine service.", "Through the shore stations of the commercial companies, press despatches, storm warnings, weather reports and other items of interest are regularly transmitted to ships at sea.", "Captains keep in touch with one another and with the home office; wrecks, derelicts and storms are reported.", "Every operator sends out regular reports daily, so that the home office can tell the exact position of the vessel.", "If she is too far from land on the one side to be reached by wireless she is near enough on the other to come within the sphere of its operations.", "Weather has no effect on wireless, therefore the question of meteorology does not come into consideration.", "Fogs, rains, torrents, tempests, snowstorms, winds, thunder, lightning or any aerial disturbance whatsoever cannot militate against the sending or receiving of wireless messages as the ether permeates them all.", "Submarine and land telegraphy used to look on wireless, the youngest sister, as the Cinderella of their name, but she has surpassed both and captured the honors of the family.", "It was in 1898 that Marconi made his first remarkable success in sending messages from England to France.", "The English station was at South Foreland and the French near Boulogne.", "The distance was thirty two miles across the British channel.", "This telegraphic communication without wires was considered a wonderful feat at the time and excited much interest.", "During the following year Marconi had so much improved his first apparatus that he was able to send out waves detected by receivers up to the one hundred mile limit.", "In 1900 communication was established between the Isle of Wight and the Lizard in Cornwall, a distance of two hundred miles.", "Up to this time the only appliances employed were induction coils giving a ten or twenty inch spark.", "Marconi and others perceived the necessity of employing greater force to penetrate the ether in order to generate stronger electrical waves.", "Oil and steam engines and other appliances were called into use to create high frequency currents and those necessitated the erection of large power stations.", "Several were erected at advantageous points and the wireless system was fairly established as a new agent of communication.", "In December, 1901, at St.", "John's, Newfoundland, Marconi by means of kites and balloons set up a temporary aerial wire in the hope of being able to receive a signal from the English station in Cornwall.", "He had made an arrangement with Poldhu station that on a certain date and at a fixed hour they should attempt the signal.", "The letter S, which in the Morse code consists of three successive dots, was chosen.", "Marconi feverishly awaited results.", "True enough on the day and at the time agreed upon the three dots were clicked off, the first signal from Europe to the American continent.", "Marconi with much difficulty set up other aerial wires and indubitably established the fact that it was possible to send electric waves across the Atlantic.", "He found, however, that waves in order to traverse three thousand miles and retain sufficient energy on their arrival to affect a telephonic wave detecting device must be generated by no inordinate power.", "These experiments proved that if stations were erected of sufficient power transatlantic wireless could be successfully carried on.", "They gave an impetus to the erection of such stations.", "On December 21, 1902, from a station at Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, Marconi sent the first message by wireless to England announcing success to his colleagues.", "The following January from Wellsfleet, Cape Cod, President Roosevelt sent a congratulatory message to King Edward.", "The electric waves conveying this message traveled 3,000 miles over the Atlantic following round an arc of forty five degrees of the earth on a great circle, and were received telephonically, by the Marconi magnetic receiver at Poldhu.", "Most ships are provided with syntonic receivers which are tuned to long distance transmitters, and are capable of receiving messages up to distances of 3,000 miles or more.", "Wireless communication between Europe and America is no longer a possibility but an accomplishment, though as yet the system has not been put on a general business basis.", "[Footnote  As we go to press a new record has been established in wireless transmission.", "Marconi, in the Argentine Republic, near Buenos Ayres, has received messages from the station at Clifden, County Galway, Ireland, a distance of 5,600 miles.", "The best previous record was made when the United States battleship _Tennessee_ in 1909 picked up a message from San Francisco when 4,580 miles distant.]", "CHAPTER III  RADIUM    Experiments of Becquerel  Work of the Curies  Discovery of   Radium  Enormous Energy  Various Uses.", "Early in 1896 just a few months after Roentgen had startled the scientific world by the announcement of the discovery of the X rays, Professor Henri Becquerel of the Natural History Museum in Paris announced another discovery which, if not as mysterious, was more puzzling and still continues a puzzle to a great degree to the present time.", "Studying the action of the salts of a rare and very heavy mineral called uranium Becquerel observed that their substances give off an invisible radiation which, like the Roentgen rays, traverse metals and other bodies opaque to light, as well as glass and other transparent substances.", "Like most of the great discoveries it was the result of accident.", "Becquerel had no idea of such radiations, had never thought of their possibility.", "In the early days of the Roentgen rays there were many facts which suggested that phosphorescence had something to do with the production of these rays It then occurred to several French physicists that X rays might be produced if phosphorescent substances were exposed to sunlight.", "Becquerel began to experiment with a view to testing this supposition.", "He placed uranium on a photographic plate which had first been wrapped in black paper in order to screen it from the light.", "After this plate had remained in the bright sunlight for several hours it was removed from the paper covering and developed.", "A slight trace of photographic action was found at those parts of the plate directly beneath the uranium just as Becquerel had expected.", "From this it appeared evident that rays of some kind were being produced that were capable of passing through black paper.", "Since the X rays were then the only ones known to possess the power to penetrate opaque substances it seemed as though the problem of producing X rays by sunlight was solved.", "Then came the fortunate accident.", "After several plates had been prepared for exposure to sunlight a severe storm arose and the experiments had to be abandoned for the time being.", "At the end of several days work was again resumed, but the plates had been lying so long in the darkroom that they were deemed almost valueless and it was thought that there would not be much use in trying to use them.", "Becquerel was about to throw them away, but on second consideration thinking that some action might have possibly taken place in the dark, he resolved to try them.", "He developed them and the result was that he obtained better pictures than ever before.", "The exposure to sunlight which had been regarded as essential to the success of the former experiments had really nothing at all to do with the matter, the essential thing was the presence of uranium and the photographic effects were not due to X rays but to the rays or emanations which Becquerel had thus discovered and which bear his name.", "There were many tedious and difficult steps to take before even our present knowledge, incomplete as it is, could be reached.", "However, Becquerel's fortunate accident of the plate developing was the beginning of the long series of experiments which led to the discovery of radium which already has revolutionized some of the most fundamental conceptions of physics and chemistry.", "It is remarkable that we owe the discovery of this wonderful element to a woman, Mme.", "Sklodowska Curie, the wife of a French professor and physicist.", "Mme.", "Curie began her work in 1897 with a systematic study of several minerals containing uranium and thorium and soon discovered the remarkable fact that there was some agent present more strongly radio active than the metal uranium itself.", "She set herself the task of finding out this agent and in conjunction with her husband, Professor Pierre Curie, made many tests and experiments.", "Finally in the ore of pitchblende they found not only one but three substances highly radio active.", "Pitchblende or uraninite is an intensely black mineral of a specific gravity of 9.5 and is found in commercial quantities in Bohemia, Cornwall in England and some other localities.", "It contains lead sulphide, lime silica, and other bodies.", "To the radio active substance which accompanied the bismuth extracted from pitchblende the Curies gave the name _Polonium_.", "To that which accompanied barium taken from the same ore they called _Radium_ and to the substance which was found among the rare earths of the pitchblende Debierne gave the name _Actinium_.", "None of these elements have been isolated, that is to say, separated in a pure state from the accompanying ore.", "Therefore, _pure radium_ is a misnomer, though we often hear the term used.", "[Footnote  Since the above was written Madame Curie has announced to the Paris Academy of Sciences that she has succeeded in obtaining pure radium.", "In conjunction with Professor Debierne she treated a decegramme of bromide of radium by electrolytic process, getting an amalgam from which was extracted the metallic radium by distillation.]", "All that has been obtained is some one of its simpler salts or compounds and until recently even these had not been prepared in pure form.", "The commonest form of the element, which in itself is very far from common, is what is known to chemistry as chloride of radium which is a combination of chlorin and radium.", "This is a grayish white powder, somewhat like ordinary coarse table salt.", "To get enough to weigh a single grain requires the treatment of 1,200 pounds of pitchblende.", "The second form of radium is as a bromide.", "In this form it costs $5,000 a grain and could a pound be obtained its value would be three and a half million dollars.", "Radium, as we understand it in any of its compounds, can communicate its property of radio activity to other bodies.", "Any material when placed near radium becomes radio active and retains such activity for a considerable time after being removed.", "Even the human body takes on this excited activity and this sometimes leads to annoyances as in delicate experiments the results may be nullified by the element acting upon the experimenter's person.", "Despite the enormous amount of energy given off by radium it seems not to change in itself, there is no appreciable loss in weight nor apparently any microscopic or chemical change in the original body.", "Professor Becquerel has stated that if a square centimeter of surface was covered by chemically pure radium it would lose but one thousandth of a milligram in weight in a million years' time.", "Radium is a body which gives out energy continuously and spontaneously.", "This liberation of energy is manifested in the different effects of its radiation and emanation, and especially in the development of heat.", "Now, according to the most fundamental principles of modern science, the universe contains a certain definite provision of energy which can appear under various forms, but which cannot be increased.", "According to Sir Oliver Lodge every cubic millimeter of ether contains as much energy as would be developed by a million horse power station working continuously far forty thousand years.", "This assertion is probably based on the fact that every corpuscle in the ether vibrates with the speed of light or about 186,000 miles a second.", "It was formerly believed that the atom was the smallest sub division in nature.", "Scientists held to the atomic theory for a long time, but at last it has been exploded, and instead of the atom being primary and indivisible we find it a very complex affair, a kind of miniature solar system, the centre of a varied attraction of molecules, corpuscles and electrons.", "Had we held to the atomic theory and denied smaller sub divisions of matter there would be no accounting for the emissions of radium, for as science now believes these emissions are merely the expulsion of millions of electrons.", "Radium gives off three distinct types of rays named after the first three letters of the Greek alphabet  Alpha, Beta, Gamma  besides a gas emanation as does thorium which is a powerfully radio active substance.", "The Alpha rays constitute ninety nine per cent, of all the rays and consist of positively electrified particles.", "Under the influence of magnetism they can be deflected.", "They have little penetrative power and are readily absorbed in passing through a sheet of paper or through a few inches of air.", "The Beta rays consist of negatively charged particles or corpuscles approximately one thousandth the size of those constituting the Alpha rays.", "They resemble cathode rays produced by an electrical discharge inside of a highly exhausted vacuum tube but work at a much higher velocity; they can be readily deflected by a magnet, they discharge electrified bodies, affect photographic plates, stimulate strongly phosphorescent bodies and are of high penetrative power.", "The radiations are a million times more powerful than those of uranium.", "They have many curious properties.", "If a photographic plate is placed in the vicinity of radium it is almost instantly affected if no screen intercepts the rays; with a screen the action is slower, but it still takes place even through thick folds, therefore, radiographs can be taken and in this way it is being utilized by surgery to view the anatomy, the internal organs, and locate bullets and other foreign substances in the system.", "A glass vessel containing radium spontaneously charges itself with electricity.", "If the glass has a weak spot, a scratch say, an electric spark is produced at that point and the vessel crumbles, just like a Leyden jar when overcharged.", "Radium liberates heat spontaneously and continuously.", "A solid salt of radium develops such an amount of heat that to every single gram there is an emission of one hundred calories per hour, in other words, radium can melt its weight in ice in the time of one hour.", "As a result of its emission of heat radium has always a temperature higher by several degrees than its surroundings.", "When a solution of a radium salt is placed in a closed vessel the radio activity in part leaves the solution and distributes itself through the vessel, the sides of which become radio active and luminous.", "Radium acts upon the chemical constituents of glass, porcelain and paper, giving them a violet tinge, changes white phosphorous into yellow, oxygen into ozone and produces many other curious chemical changes.", "We have said that it can serve the surgeon in physical examinations of the body after the manner of X rays.", "It has not, however, been much employed in this direction owing to its scarcity and prohibitive price.", "It has given excellent results in the treatment of certain skin diseases, in cancer, etc.", "However it can have very baneful effects on animal organisms.", "It has produced paralysis and death in dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, guinea pigs and other animals, and undoubtedly it might affect human beings in a similar way.", "Professor Curie said that a single gram of chemically pure radium would be sufficient to destroy the life of every man, woman and child in Paris providing they were separately and properly exposed to its influence.", "Radium destroys the germinative power of seeds and retards the growth of certain forms of life, such as larvae, so that they do not pass into the chrysalis and insect stages of development, but remain in the state of larvae.", "At a certain distance it causes the hair of mice to fall out, but on the contrary at the same distance it increases the hair or fur on rabbits.", "It often produces severe burns on the hands and other portions of the body too long exposed to its activity.", "It can penetrate through gases, liquids and all ordinary solids, even through many inches of the hardest steel.", "On a comparatively short exposure it has been known to partially paralyze an electric charged bar.", "Heat nor cold do not affect its radioactivity in the least.", "It gives off but little light, its luminosity being largely due to the stimulation of the impurities in the radium by the powerful but invisible radium rays.", "Radium stimulates powerfully various mineral and chemical substances near which it is placed.", "It is an infallible test of the genuineness of the diamond.", "The genuine diamond phosphoresces strongly when brought into juxtaposition, but the paste or imitation one glows not at all.", "It is seen that the study of the properties of radium is of great interest.", "This is true also of the two other elements found in the ores of uranium and thorium, viz., polonium and actinium.", "Polonium, so called, in honor of the native land of Mme.", "Curie, is just as active as radium when first extracted from the pitchblende but its energy soon lessens and finally it becomes inert, hence there has been little experimenting or investigation.", "The same may be said of actinium.", "The process of obtaining radium from pitchblende is most tedious and laborious and requires much patience.", "The residue of the pitchblende from which uranium has been extracted by fusion with sodium carbonate and solution in dilute sulphuric acid, contains the radium along with other metals, and is boiled with concentrated sodium carbonate solution, and the solution of the residue in hydrochloric acid precipitated with sulphuric acid.", "The insoluble barium and radium sulphates, after being converted into chlorides or bromides, are separated by repeated fractional crystallization.", "One kilogram of impure radium bromide is obtained from a ton of pitchblende residue after processes continued for about three months during which time, five tons of chemicals and fifty tons of rinsing water are used.", "As has been said the element has never been isolated or separated in its metallic or pure state and most of the compounds are impure.", "Radium banks have been established in London, Paris and New York.", "Whenever radium is employed in surgery for an operation about fifty milligrams are required at least and the banks let out the amount for about $200 a day.", "If purchased the price for this amount would be $4,000.", "CHAPTER IV  MOVING PICTURES    Photographing Motion  Edison's Kinetoscope  Lumiere's   Cinematographe  Before the Camera  The Mission of the Moving   Picture.", "Few can realize the extent of the field covered by moving pictures.", "In the dual capacity of entertainment and instruction there is not a rival in sight.", "As an instructor, science is daily widening the sphere of the motion picture for the purpose of illustration.", "Films are rapidly superseding text books in many branches.", "Every department capable of photographic demonstration is being covered by moving pictures.", "Negatives are now being made of the most intricate surgical operations and these are teaching the students better than the witnessing of the real operations, for at the critical moment of the operation the picture machine can be stopped to let the student view over again the way it is accomplished, whereas at the operating table the surgeon must go on with his work to try to save life and cannot explain every step in the process of the operation.", "There is no doubt that the moving picture machine will perform a very important part in the future teaching of surgery.", "In the naturalist's domain of science it is already playing a very important part.", "A device for micro photography has now been perfected in connection with motion machines whereby things are magnified to a great degree.", "By this means the analysis of a substance can be better illustrated than any way else.", "For instance a drop of water looks like a veritable Zoo with terrible looking creatures wiggling and wriggling through it, and makes one feel as if he never wanted to drink water again.", "The moving picture in its general phase is entertainment and instruction rolled into one and as such it has superseded the theatre.", "It is estimated that at the present time in America there are upwards of 20,000 moving picture shows patronized daily by almost ten million people.", "It is doubtful if the theatre attendance at the best day of the winter season reaches five millions.", "The moving picture in importance is far beyond the puny functions of comedy and tragedy.", "The grotesque farce of vaudeville and the tawdry show which only appeals to sentiment at highest and often to the base passions at lowest.", "Despite prurient opposition it is making rapid headway.", "It is entering very largely into the instructive and the entertaining departments of the world's curriculum.", "Millions of dollars are annually expended in the production of films.", "Companies of trained and practiced actors are brought together to enact pantomimes which will concentrate within the space of a few minutes the most entertaining and instructive incidents of history and the leading happenings of the world.", "At all great events, no matter where transpiring, the different moving picture companies have trained men at the front ready with their cameras to \"catch\" every incident, every movement even to the wink of an eyelash, so that the \"stay at homes\" can see the _show_ as well, and with a great deal more comfort than if they had traveled hundreds, or even thousands, of miles to be present in _propria persona_.", "How did moving pictures originate?", "What and when were the beginning?", "It is popularly believed that animated pictures had their inception with Edison who projected the biograph in 1887, having based it on that wonderful and ingenious toy, the Zoetrope.", "Long before 1887, however, several men of inventive faculties had turned their attention to a means of giving apparent animation to pictures.", "The first that met with any degree of success was Edward Muybridge, a photographer of San Francisco.", "This was in 1878.", "A revolution had been brought about in photography by the introduction of the instantaneous process.", "By the use of sensitive films of gelatine bromide of silver emulsion the time required for the action of ordinary daylight in producing a photograph had been reduced to a very small fraction of a second.", "Muybridge utilized these films for the photographic analysis of animal motion.", "Beside a race track he placed a battery of cameras, each camera being provided with a spring shutter which was controlled by a thread stretched across the track.", "A running horse broke each thread the moment he passed in front of the camera and thus twenty or thirty pictures of him were taken in close succession within one or two seconds of time.", "From the negatives secured in this way a series of positives were obtained in proper order on a strip of sensitized paper.", "The strip when examined by means of the Zoetrope furnished a reproduction of the horse's movements.", "The Zoetrope was a toy familiar to children; it was sometimes called the wheel of life.", "It was a contrivance consisting of a cylinder some ten inches wide, open at the top, around the lower and interior rim of which a series of related pictures were placed.", "The cylinder was then rapidly rotated and the spectator looking through the vertical narrow slits on its outer surface, could fancy that the pictures inside were moving.", "Muybridge devised an instrument which he called a Zoopraxiscope for the optical projection of his zoetrope photographs.", "The succession of positives was arranged in proper order upon a glass disk about 18 inches in diameter near its circumference.", "This disk was mounted conveniently for rapid revolution so that each picture would pass in front of the condenser of an optical lantern.", "The difficulties involved in the preparation of the disk pictures and in the manipulation of the zoopraxiscope prevented the instrument from attracting much attention.", "However, artistically speaking, it was the forerunner of the numerous \"graphs\" and \"scopes\" and moving picture machines of the present day.", "It was in 1887 that Edison conceived an idea of associating with his phonograph, which had then achieved a marked success, an instrument which would reproduce to the eye the effect of motion by means of a swift and graded succession of pictures, so that the reproduction of articulate sounds as in the phonograph, would be accompanied by the reproduction of the motion naturally associated with them.", "The principle of the instrument was suggested to Edison by the zoetrope, and of course, he well knew what Muybridge had accomplished in the line of motion pictures of animals almost ten years previously.", "Edison, however, did not employ a battery of cameras as Muybridge had done, but devised a special form of camera in which a long strip of sensitized film was moved rapidly behind a lens provided with a shutter, and so arranged as to alternately admit and cut off the light from the moving object.", "He adjusted the mechanism so that there were 46 exposures a second, the film remaining stationary during the momentary time of exposure, after which it was carried forward far enough to bring a new surface into the proper position.", "The time of the shifting was about one tenth of that allowed for exposure, so that the actual time of exposure was about the one fiftieth of a second.", "The film moved, reckoning shiftings and stoppages for exposures, at an average speed of a little more than a foot per second, so that a length of film of about fifty feet received between 700 and 800 impressions in a circuit of 40 seconds.", "Edison named his first instrument the kinetoscope.", "It came out in 1893.", "It was hailed with delight at the time and for a short period was much in demand, but soon new devices came into the field and the kinetoscope was superseded by other machines bearing similar names with a like signification.", "A variety of cameras was invented.", "One consisted of a film feeding mechanism which moves the film step by step in the focus of a single lens, the duration of exposure being from twenty to twenty five times as great as that necessary to move an unexposed portion of the film into position.", "No shutter was employed.", "As time passed many other improvements were made.", "An ingenious Frenchman named Lumiere, came forward with his Cinematographe which for a few years gave good satisfaction, producing very creditable results.", "Success, however, was due more to the picture ribbons than to the mechanism employed to feed them.", "Of other moving pictures machines we have had the vitascope, vitagraph, magniscope, mutoscope, panoramagraph, theatograph and scores of others all derived from the two Greek roots _grapho_ I write and _scopeo_ I view.", "The vitascope is the principal name now in use for moving picture machines.", "In all these instruments in order that the film projection may be visible to an audience it is necessary to have a very intense light.", "A source of such light is found in the electric focusing lamp.", "At or near the focal point of the projecting lantern condenser the film is made to travel across the field as in the kinetoscope.", "A water cell in front of the condenser absorbs most of the heat and transmits most of the light from the arc lamp, and the small picture thus highly illuminated is protected from injury.", "A projecting lens of rather short focus throws a large image of each picture on the screen, and the rapid succession of these completes the illusion of life like motion.", "Hundreds of patents have been made on cameras, projecting lenses and machines from the days of the kinetoscope to the present time when clear cut moving pictures portray life so closely and so well as almost to deceive the eye.", "In fact in many cases the counterfeit is taken for the reality and audiences as much aroused as if they were looking upon a scene of actual life.", "We can well believe the story of the Irishman, who on seeing the stage villain abduct the young lady, made a rush at the canvas yelling out,  \"Let me at the blackguard and I'll murder him.\"", "Though but fifteen years old the moving picture industry has sent out its branches into all civilized lands and is giving employment to an army of thousands.", "It would be hard to tell how many mimic actors and actresses make a living by posing for the camera; their name is legion.", "Among them are many professionals who receive as good a salary as on the stage.", "Some of the large concerns both in Europe and America at times employ from one hundred to two hundred hands and even more to illustrate some of the productions.", "They send their photographers and actors all over the world for settings.", "Most of the business, however, is done near home.", "With trapping and other paraphernalia a stage setting can be effected to simulate almost any scene.", "Almost anything under the sun can be enacted in a moving picture studio, from the drowning of a cat to the hanging of a man; a horse race or fire alarm is not outside the possible and the aviator has been depicted \"flying\" high in the heavens.", "The places where the pictures are prepared must be adapted for the purpose.", "They are called studios and have glass roofs and in most of them a good section of the walls are also glass.", "The floor space is divided into sections for the setting or staging of different productions, therefore several representations can take place at the same time before the eyes of the cameras.", "There are \"properties\" of all kinds from the ragged garments of the beggar to kingly ermine and queenly silks.", "Paste diamonds sparkle in necklaces, crowns and tiaras, seeming to rival the scintillations of the Kohinoor.", "At the first, objections were made to moving pictures on the ground that in many cases they had a tendency to cater to the lower instincts, that subjects were illustrated which were repugnant to the finer feelings and appealed to the gross and the sensual.", "Burglaries, murders and wild western scenes in which the villain heroes triumphed were often shown and no doubt these had somewhat of a pernicious influence on susceptible youth.", "But all such pictures have for the most part been eliminated and there is a strict taboo on anything with a degrading influence or partaking of the brutal.", "Prize fights are often barred.", "In many large cities there is a board of censorship to which the different manufacturing firms must submit duplicates.", "This board has to pass on all the films before they are released and if the pictures are in any way contrary to morals or decency or are in any respect unfit to be displayed before the public, they cannot be put in circulation.", "Thus are the people protected and especially the youth who should be permitted to see nothing that is not elevating or not of a nature to inspire them with high and noble thoughts and with ambitions to make the world better and brighter.", "Let us hope that the future mission of the moving picture will be along educational and moral lines tending to uplift and ennoble our boys and girls so that they may develop into a manhood and womanhood worthy the history and best traditions of our country.", "*       *       *       *       *       *  The Wizard of Menlo Park has just succeeded after two years of hard application to the experiment in giving us the talking picture, a real genuine talking picture, wholly independent of the old device of having the actors talk behind the screen when the films were projected.", "By a combination of the phonograph and the moving picture machine working in perfect synchronism the result is obtained.", "Wires are attached to the mechanism of both the machines, the one behind the screen and the one in front, in such a way that the two are operated simultaneously so that when a film is projected a corresponding record on the phonograph acts in perfect unison supplying the voice suitable to the moving action.", "Men and women pass along the canvas, act, talk, laugh, cry and \"have their being\" just as in real life.", "Of course, they are immaterial, merely the reflection of films, but the one hundred thousandth of an inch thick, yet they give forth oral sounds as creatures of flesh and blood.", "In fact every sound is produced harmoniously with the action on the screen.", "An iron ball is dropped and you hear its thud upon the floor, a plate is cracked and you can hear the cracking just the same as if the material plate were broken in your presence.", "An immaterial piano appears upon the screen and a fleshless performer discourses airs as real as those heard on Broadway.", "Melba and Tettrazini and Caruso and Bonci appear before you and warble their nightingale notes, as if behind the footlights with a galaxy of beauty, wealth and fashion before them for an audience.", "True it is not even their astral bodies you are looking at, only their pictured representations, but the magic of their voices is there all the same and there is such an atmosphere of realism about the representations that you can scarcely believe the actors are not present in _propriae personae_.", "Mr.", "Edison had much study and labor of experiment in bringing his device to a successful issue.", "The greatest obstacle he had to overcome was in getting a phonograph that could \"hear\" far enough.", "At the beginning of the experiments the actor had to talk directly into the horn, which made the right kind of pictures impossible to get.", "Bit by bit, however, a machine was perfected which could \"hear\" so well that the actor could move at his pleasure within a radius of twenty feet.", "That is the machine that is being used now.", "This new combination of the moving picture machine and the phonograph Edison has named the _kinetophone_.", "By it he has made possible the bringing of grand opera into the hamlets of the West, and through it also our leading statesmen may address audiences on the mining camps and the wilds of the prairies where their feet have never trodden.", "CHAPTER V  SKY SCRAPERS AND HOW THEY ARE BUILT    Evolution of the Sky scraper  Construction  New York's Giant   Buildings  Dimensions.", "The sky scraper is an architectural triumph, but at the same time it is very much of a commercial enterprise, and it is indigenous, native born to American soil.", "It had its inception here, particularly in New York and Chicago.", "The tallest buildings in the world are in New York.", "The most notable of these, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Building with fifty stories towering up to a height of seven hundred feet and three inches, has been the crowning achievement of architectural art, the highest building yet erected by man.", "How is it possible to erect such building  how is it possible to erect a sky scraper at all?", "A partial answer may be given in one word  _steel_.", "Generally speaking the method of building all these huge structures is much the same.", "Massive piers or pillars are erected, inside which are usually strong steel columns; crosswise from column to column great girders are placed forming a base for the floor, and then upon the first pillars are raised other steel columns slightly decreased in size, upon which girders are again fixed for the next floor; and so on this process is continued floor after floor.", "There seems no reason why buildings should not be reared like this for even a hundred stories, provided the foundations are laid deep enough and broad enough.", "The walls are not really the support of the buildings.", "The essential elements are the columns and girders of steel forming the skeleton framework of the whole.", "The masonry may assist, but the piers and girders carry the principal weight.", "If, therefore, everything depends upon these piers, which are often of steel and masonry combined, the immense importance will be seen of basing them upon adequate foundations.", "And thus it comes about that to build high we must dig deep, which fact may be construed as an aphorism to fit more subjects than the building of sky scrapers.", "To attempt to build a sky scraper without a suitable foundation would be tantamount to endeavoring to build a house on a marsh without draining the marsh,  it would count failure at the very beginning.", "The formation depends on the height, the calculated weight the frame work will carry, the amount of air pressure, the vibrations from the running of internal machines and several other details of less importance than those mentioned, but of deep consequence in the aggregate.", "Instead of being carried on thick walls spread over a considerable area of ground, the sky scrapers are carried wholly on steel columns.", "This concentrates many hundred tons of load and develops pressure which would crush the masonry and cause the structures to penetrate soft earth almost as a stone sinks in water.", "In the first place the weight of the proposed building and contents is estimated, then the character of the soil determined to a depth of one hundred feet if necessary.", "In New York the soil is treacherous and difficult, there are underground rivers in places and large deposits of sand so that to get down to rock bottom or pan is often a very hard undertaking.", "Generally speaking the excavations are made to about a depth of thirty feet.", "A layer of concrete a foot or two thick is spread over the bottom of the pit and on it are bedded rows of steel beams set close together.", "Across the middle of these beams deep steel girders are placed on which the columns are erected.", "The heavy weight is thus spread out by the beams, girders and concrete so as to cause a reduced uniform pressure on the soil.", "Cement is filled in between the beams and girders and packed around them to seal them thoroughly against moisture; then clean earth or sand is rammed in up to the column bases and covered with the concrete of the cellar floor.", "In some cases the foundation loads are so numerous that nothing short of masonry piers on solid rock will safely sustain them.", "To accomplish this very strong airtight steel or wooden boxes with flat tops and no bottoms are set on the pier sites at ground water level and pumped full of compressed air while men enter them and excavating the soil, undermine them, so they sink, until they land on the rock and are filled solid with concrete to form the bases of the foundation piers.", "On the average the formation should have a resisting power of two tons to the square foot, dead load.", "By dead load is meant the weight of the steelwork, floors and walls, as distinguished from the office furniture and occupants which come under the head of living load.", "Some engineers take into consideration the pressure of both dead and live loads gauging the strength of the foundation, but the dead load pressure of 2 tons to the square foot will do for the reckoning, for as a live load only exerts a pressure of 60 lbs.", "to the square foot it may be included in the former.", "The columns carry the entire weights including dead and live loads and the wind pressure, into the footings, these again distributing the loads on the soil.", "The aim is to have an equal pressure per square foot of soil at the same time, for all footings, thus insuring an even settlement.", "The skeleton construction now almost wholly consists of wrought steel.", "At first cast iron and wrought iron were used but it was found they corroded too quickly.", "There are two classes of steel construction, the cage and the skeleton.", "In the cage construction the frame is strengthened for wind stresses and the walls act as curtains.", "In the skeleton, the frame carries only the vertical loads and depends upon the walls for its wind bracing.", "It has been found that the wind pressure is about 30 lbs.", "for every square foot of exposed surface.", "The steel columns reach from the foundation to the top, riveted together by plates and may be extended to an indefinite height.", "In fact there is no engineering limit to the height.", "The outside walls of the sky scraper vary in thickness with the height of the building and also vary in accordance with the particular kind of construction, whether cage or skeleton.", "If of the cage variety, the walls, as has been said, act as curtains and consequently they are thinner than in the skeleton type of construction.", "In the latter case the walls have to resist the wind pressure unsupported by the steel frame and therefore they must be of a sufficient width.", "Brick and terra cotta blocks are used for construction generally.", "Terra cotta blocks are also much used in the flooring, and for this purpose have several advantages over other materials; they are absolutely fire proof, they weigh less per cubic foot than any other kind of fire proof flooring and they are almost sound proof.", "They do equally well for flat and arched floors.", "It is of the utmost importance that the sky scraper be absolutely fire proof from bottom to top.", "These great buzzing hives of industry house at one time several thousand human beings and a panic would entail a fearful calamity, and, moreover, their height places the upper stories beyond reach of a water tower and the pumping engines of the street.", "The sky scrapers of to day are as fireproof as human ingenuity and skill can make them, and this is saying much; in fact, it means that they cannot burn.", "Of course fires can break out in rooms and apartments in the manufacturing of chemicals or testing experiments, etc., but these are easily confined to narrow limits and readily extinguished with the apparatus at hand.", "Steel columns will not burn, but if exposed to heat of sufficient degree they will warp and bend and probably collapse, therefore they should be protected by heat resisting agents.", "Nothing can be better than terra cotta and concrete for this purpose.", "When terra cotta blocks are used they should be at least 2 inches thick with an air space running through them.", "Columns are also fire proofed by wrapping expanded metal or other metal lathing around them and plastering.", "Then a furring system is put on and another layer of metal, lathing and plastering.", "This if well done is probably safer than the layer of hollow tile.", "The floor beams should be entirely covered with terra cotta blocks or concrete, so that no part of them is left exposed.", "As most office trimmings are of wood care should be taken that all electric wires are well insulated.", "Faulty installation of dynamos, motors and other apparatus is frequently the cause of office fires.", "The lighting of a sky scraper is a most elaborate arrangement.", "Some of them use as many lights as would well supply a good sized town.", "The Singer Building in New York has 15,000 incandescent lamps and it is safe to say the Metropolitan Life Insurance Building has more than twice this number as the floor area of the latter is 2 1/2 times as great.", "The engines and dynamos are in the basement and so fixed that their vibrations do not affect the building.", "As space is always limited in the basements of sky scrapers direct connected engines and dynamos are generally installed instead of belt connected and the boilers operated under a high steam pressure.", "Besides delivering steam to the engines the boilers also supply it to a variety of auxiliary pumps, as boiler feed, fire pump, blow off, tank pump and pump for forcing water through the building.", "The heating arrangement of such a vast area as is covered by the floor space of a sky scraper has been a very difficult problem but it has been solved so that the occupant of the twentieth story can receive an equal degree of heat with the one on the ground floor.", "Both hot water and steam are utilized.", "Hot water heating, however, is preferable to steam, as it gives a much steadier heat.", "The radiators arc proportioned to give an average temperature of 65 degrees F. in each room during the winter months.", "There are automatic regulating devices attached to the radiators, so if the temperature rises above or falls below a certain point the steam or hot water is automatically turned on or off.", "Some buildings are heated by the exhaust steam from the engines but most have boilers solely for the purpose.", "The sanitary system is another important feature.", "The supplying of water for wash stands, the dispositions of wastes and the flushing of lavatories tax all the skill of the mechanical engineer.", "Several of these mighty buildings call for upwards of a thousand lavatories.", "In considering the sky scraper we should not forget the role played by the electric elevator.", "Without it these buildings would be practically useless, as far as the upper stories are concerned.", "The labor of stair climbing would leave them untenanted.", "No one would be willing to climb ten, twenty or thirty flights and tackle a day's work after the exertion of doing so.", "To climb to the fiftieth story in such a manner would be well nigh impossible or only possible by relays, and after one would arrive at the top he would be so physically exhausted that both mental and manual endeavor would be out of the question.", "Therefore the elevator is as necessary to the skyscraper as are doors and windows.", "Indeed were it not for the introduction of the elevator the business sections of our large cities would still consist of the five and six story structures of our father's time instead of the towering edifices which now lift their heads among the clouds.", "Regarded less than half a century ago as an unnecessary luxury the elevator to day is an imperative necessity.", "Sky scrapers are equipped with both express and local elevators.", "The express elevators do not stop until about the tenth floor is reached.", "They run at a speed of about ten feet per second.", "There are two types of elevators in general use, one lifting the car by cables from the top, and the other with a hydraulic plunger acting directly upon the bottom of the car.", "The former are operated either by electric motors or hydraulic cylinders and the latter by hydraulic rams, the cylinders extending the full height of the building into the ground.", "America is pre eminently the land of the sky scraper, but England and France to a degree are following along the same lines, though nothing as yet has been erected on the other side of the water to equal the towering triumphs of architectural art on this side.", "In no country in the world is space at such a premium as in New York City, therefore, New York _per se_ may be regarded as the true home of the tall building, although Chicago is not very much behind the Metropolis in this respect.", "As figures are more eloquent than words in description the following data of the two giant structures of the Western World may be interesting.", "The Singer Building at the corner of Broadway and Liberty Street, New York City, has a total height from the basement floor to the top of the flagstaff of 742 feet; the height from street to roof is 612 feet, 1 inch.", "There are 41 stories.", "The weight of the steel in the entire building is 9,200 tons.", "It has 16 elevators, 5 steam engines, 5 dynamos, 5 boilers and 28 steam pumps.", "The length of the steam and water piping is 5 miles.", "The cubical contents of the building comprise 66,950,000 cubic feet, there are 411,000 square feet of floor area or about 9 1/2 acres.", "The weight of the tower is 18,300 tons.", "Little danger from a collapse will be apprehended when it is learned that the columns are securely bolted and caissons which have been sunk to rock bed 80 feet below the curb.", "The other campanile which has excited the wonder and admiration of the world is the colossal pile known as the Metropolitan Building.", "This occupies the entire square or block as we call it from 23rd St.", "to 24th St.", "and from Madison to Fourth Avenue.", "It is 700 feet and 3 inches above the sidewalk and has 50 stories.", "The main building which has a frontage of 200 feet by 425 feet is ten stories in height.", "It is built in the early Italian renaissance style the materials being steel and marble.", "The Campanile is carried up in the same style and is also of marble.", "It stands on a base measuring 75 by 83 feet and the architectural treatment is chaste, though severe, but eminently agreeable to the stupendous proportions of the structure.", "The tower is quite different from that of the Singer Building.", "It has twelve wall and eight interior columns connected at every fourth floor by diagonal braces; these columns carry 1,800 pounds to the linear foot.", "The wind pressure calculated at the rate of 30 lbs.", "to the square foot is enormous and is provided for by deep wall girders and knee braces which transfer the strain to the columns and to the foundation.", "The average cross section of the tower is 75 by 85 feet, the floor space of the entire building is 1,080,000 square feet or about 25 acres.", "The tower of this surpassing cloud piercing structure can be seen for many miles from the surrounding country and from the bay it looks like a giant sentinel in white watching the mighty city at its feet and proclaiming the ceaseless activity and progress of the Western World.", "CHAPTER VI  OCEAN PALACES    Ocean Greyhounds  Present Day Floating Palaces  Regal   Appointments  Passenger Accommodation

waves with a swiftness and safety deemed absolutely impossible fifty years ago.", "In view of the luxurious accommodations and princely surroundings to be found on the modern ocean palaces, it is interesting to look back now almost a hundred years to the time when the _Savannah_ was the first steamship to cross the Atlantic.", "True the voyage of this pioneer of steam from Savannah to Liverpool was not much of a success, but she managed to crawl across the sails very materially aiding the engines, and heralded the dawn of a new day in transatlantic travel.", "No other steamboat attempted the trip for almost twenty years after, until in 1838 the _Great Western_ made the run in fifteen days.", "This revolutionized water travel and set the whole world talking.", "It was the beginning of the passing of the sailing ship and was an event for rejoicing.", "In the old wooden hulks with their lazily flapping wings, waiting for a breeze to stir them, men and women and children huddled together like so many animals in a pen, had to spend weeks and months on the voyage between Europe and America.", "There was little or no room for sanitation, the space was crowded, deadly germs lurked in every cranny and crevice, and consequently hundreds died.", "To many indeed the sailing ship became a floating hearse.", "In those times, and they are not so remote, a voyage was dreaded as a calamity.", "Only necessity compelled the undertaking.", "It was not travel for pleasure, for pleasure under such circumstances and amid such surroundings was impossible.", "The poor emigrants who were compelled through stress and poverty to leave their homes for a foreign country feared not toil in a new land, but they feared the long voyage with its attending horrors and dangers.", "Dangerous it was, for most of the sailing vessels were unseaworthy and when a storm swept the waters, they were as children's toys, at the mercy of wind and wave.", "When the passenger stepped on board he always had the dread of a watery grave before him.", "How different to day.", "Danger has been eliminated almost to the vanishing point and the mighty monsters of steel and oak now cut through the waves in storms and hurricanes with as much ease as a duck swims through a pond.", "From the time the _Great Western_ was launched, steamships sailing between American and English ports became an established institution.", "Soon after the _Great Western's_ first voyage a sturdy New England Quaker from Nova Scotia named Samuel Cunard went over to London to try and interest the British government in a plan to establish a line of steamships between the two countries.", "He succeeded in raising 270,000 pounds, and built the _Britannia_, the first Cunard vessel to cross the Atlantic.", "This was in 1840.", "As ships go now she was a small craft indeed.", "Her gross tonnage was 1,154 and her horse power 750.", "She carried only first class passengers and these only to the limit of one hundred.", "There was not much in the way of accommodation as the quarters were cramped, the staterooms small and the sanitation and ventilation defective.", "It was on the _Britannia_ that Charles Dickens crossed over to America in 1842 and he has given us in his usual style a pen picture of his impressions aboard.", "He stated that the saloon reminded him of nothing so much as of a hearse, in which a number of half starved stewards attempted to warm themselves by a glimmering stove, and that the staterooms so called were boxes in which the bunks were shelves spread with patches of filthy bed clothing, somewhat after the style of a mustard plaster.", "This criticism must be taken with a little reservation.", "Dickens was a pessimist and always censorious and as he had been feted and feasted with the fat of the land, he expected that he should have been entertained in kingly quarters on shipboard.", "But because things did not come up to his expectations he dipped his pen in vitriol and began to criticise.", "At any rate the _Britannia_ in her day was looked upon as the _ne plus ultra_ in naval architecture, the very acme of marine engineering.", "The highest speed she developed was eight and one half knots or about nine and three quarters miles an hour.", "She covered the passage from Liverpool to Boston in fourteen and one half days, which was then regarded as a marvellous feat and one which was proclaimed throughout England with triumph.", "For a long time the _Britannia_ remained Queen of the Seas for speed, but in 1852 the Atlantic record was reduced to nine and a half days by the _Arctic_.", "In 1876 the _City of Paris_ cut down the time to eight days and four hours.", "Twelve years later in 1879 the _Arizona_ still further reduced it to seven days and eight hours.", "In 1881 the _Alaska_, the first vessel to receive the title of \"_Ocean Greyhound_,\" made the trip in six days and twenty one hours; in 1885 the _Umbria_ bounded over in six days and two hours, in 1890 the _Teutonic_ of the White Star line came across in five days, eighteen hours and twenty eight minutes, which was considered the limit for many years to come.", "It was not long however, until the Cunard lowered the colors of the White Star, when the _Lucania_ in 1893 brought the record down to five days and twelve hours.", "For a dozen years or so the limit of speed hovered round the five and a half day mark, the laurels being shared alternately by the vessels of the Cunard and White Star Companies.", "Then the Germans entered the field of competition with steamers of from 14,500 to 20,000 tons register and from 28,000 to 40,000 horse power.", "The _Deutschland_ soon began setting the pace for the ocean greyhounds, while other vessels of the North German Lloyd line that won transatlantic honors were the _Kaiser Wilhelm II., Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, Kronprinz Wilhelm and Kronprinzessin Cecilie_, all remarkably fast boats with every modern luxury aboard that science could devise.", "These vessels are equipped with wireless telegraphy, submarine signalling systems, water tight compartments and every other safety appliance known to marine skill.", "The _Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse_ raised the standard of German supremacy in 1902 by making the passage from Cherbourg to Sandy Hook lightship in five days and fifteen hours.", "In 1909, however, the sister steamships _Mauretania_ and _Lusitania_ of the Cunard line lowered all previous ocean records, by making the trip in a little over four and a half days.", "They have been keeping up this speed to the present time, and are universally regarded as the fastest and best equipped steamships in the world,  the very last word in ocean travel.", "On her last mid September voyage the _Mauretania_ has broken all ocean records by making the passage from Queenstown to New York in 4 days 10 hours and 47 minutes.", "But they are closely pursued by the White Star greyhounds such as the _Oceanic_, the _Celtic_ and the _Cedric_, steamships of world wide fame for service, appointments, and equipment.", "Yet at the present writing the Cunard Company has another vessel on the stocks, to be named the _Falconia_ which in measurements will eclipse the other two and which they are confident will make the Atlantic trip inside four days.", "The White Star Company is also building two immense boats to be named the _Olympic_ and _Titanic_.", "They will be 840 feet in length and will be the largest ships afloat.", "However, it is said that freight and passenger room is being more considered in the construction than speed and that they will aim to lower no records.", "Each will be able to accommodate 5,000 passengers besides a crew of 600.", "All the great liners of the present day may justly be styled ocean palaces, as far as luxuries and general appointments are concerned, but as the _Mauretania_ and _Lusitania_ are best known, a description of either of these will convey an idea to stay at homes of the regal magnificence and splendors of the floating hotels which modern science places at the disposal of the traveling public.", "Though sister ships and modeled on similar lines, the _Mauretania_ and _Lusitania_ differ somewhat in construction.", "Of the two the _Mauretania_ is the more typical ship as well as the more popular.", "This modern triumph of the

which probably will cross the Atlantic ocean in less than four days if not in three.", "But the question is, where shall we put her, that is, where shall we dock her?", "To build a thousand foot pier to accommodate her, appears like a good answer to this question, but the great difficulty is that there are United States Government regulations restricting the length of piers to 800 feet.", "Docking space along the shore of New York harbor is too valuable to permit the ship being berthed parallel to the shore, therefore vessels must dock at right angles to the shore.", "Some provisions must soon be made and the regulations as to dock lengths revised.", "The thousand footer may be here in a couple of years or so.", "In the meantime the two 840 footers are already on the stocks at Belfast and are expected to arrive early in 1911.", "Before they come changes and improvements must be made in the docking and harbor facilities of the port of New York.", "If higher speed is demanded, increased size is essential, since with even the best result every 100 horse power added involves an addition to machinery weight of approximately 14 tons and to the area occupied of about 40 square feet.", "To accomplish this the ship must be as much larger in proportion.", "The ship designer has to work within circumscribed limits.", "If he could make his vessel of any depth he might build much larger and there would be theoretically no limit to his speed  40 knots an hour might be obtained as easily as the present maximum of 26, but in designing his ship he must remember that in the harbors of New York or Liverpool the channels are not much beyond 30 feet in depth.", "High speed necessitates powerful engines, but if the engines be too large there will not be space enough for coal to feed the furnaces.", "If the breadth of the ship is increased the speed is diminished, while on the other hand, if too powerful engines are put in a narrow vessel she will break her back.", "The proper proportions must be carefully studied as regards length, breadth, depth and weight so that the vessel will derive the greatest speed from her engines.", "CHAPTER VII  WONDERFUL CREATIONS IN PLANT LIFE  Mating Plants  Experiments of Burbank  What he has Accomplished.", "In California lives a wonderful man.", "He has succeeded in doing more than making two blades of grass grow where grew but one.", "Yearly, daily in fact, this wizard of plant life is playing tricks on old Mother Nature, transforming her vegetable children into different shapes and making them no longer recognizable in their original forms.", "Like the fairies in Irish mythology, this man steals away the plant babies, but instead of leaving sickly elves in their places, he brings into the world exceedingly healthy or lusty youngsters which grow up into a full maturity, and develop traits of character superior to the ones they supplant.", "For instance he took away the ugly, thorny insipid cactus and replaced it by a beautiful smooth juicy one which is now making the western deserts blossom as the rose.", "The name of this man is Luther Burbank whose fame as a creator of new plants has become world wide.", "The basic principle of Burbank's plant magic comes under two heads, viz.", "  breeding and selection.", "He mates two different species in such a way that they will propagate a type partaking of the natures of both but superior to either in their qualities.", "In order to effect the best results from mating, he is choice in his selection of species  the best is taken and the worst rejected.", "It is a universal law that the bad can never produce the good; consequently when good is desired, as is universally the case, bad must be eliminated.", "In his method, Burbank gives the good a chance to assert itself and at the same time takes away all opportunity from the bad.", "So that the latter cannot thrive but must decay and pass out of being.", "He takes two plants  they may be of the same species, but as a general rule he prefers to experiment with those of different species; he perceives that neither one in its present surroundings is putting forth what is naturally expected from it, that each is either retrograding in the scale of life or standing still for lack of encouragement to go forward.", "He knows that back of these plants is a long history of evolutions from primitive beginnings to their present stage just as in the case of man himself.", "'Tis a far cry from the cliff dweller wielding his stone axe and roaming nude through the fields and forests after his prey  the wild beast  to the lordly creature of to day  the product of long ages of civilization and culture, yet high as the state is to which man has been brought, in many cases he is hemmed in and surrounded by circumstances which preclude him from putting forth the best that is in him and showing his full possibilities to the world.", "The philosopher is often hidden in the ploughman and many a poor laborer toiling in corduroys and fustian at the docks, in the mills, or sweeping the streets may have as good a brain as Edison, but has not the opportunity to develop it and show its capabilities.", "The same analogy is applicable to plant life.", "Under adverse conditions a plant or vegetable cannot put forth its best efforts.", "In a scrawny, impoverished soil, and exhausted atmosphere, lacking the constituents of nurture, the plant will become dwarfed and unproductive, whereas on good ground and in good air, which have the succulent properties to nourish it the best results may be expected.", "The soil and the air, therefore, from which are derived the constituents of plant life, are indispensably necessary, but they are not the primal principles upon which that life depends for its being.", "The basis, the foundation, the origin of the life is the seed which germinates in the soil and evolves itself into the plant.", "A dead seed will not germinate, a contaminated seed may, but the plant it produces will not be a healthy one and it will only be after a long series of transplantings, with patience and care, that at length a really sound plant will be obtained.", "The same principle holds good in regard to the human plant.", "It is hard to offset an evil ancestry.", "The contamination goes on from generation to generation, just as in the case of the notorious Juke family which cost New York State hundreds of thousands of dollars in consequence of criminality and idiocy.", "It requires almost a miracle to divert an individual sprung from a corrupt stem into a healthy, moral course of living.", "There must be some powerful force brought to bear to make him break the ligatures which bind him to ancestral nature and enable him to come forth on a plane where he will be susceptible to the influence of what is good and noble.", "Such can be done and has been accomplished.", "Burbank is accomplishing such miracles in the vegetable kingdom, in fact he is recreating species as it were and developing them to a full fruition.", "Of course as in the case of the conversion of a sinner from his evil instincts, much opposition is met and the progress at first is slow, but finally the plant becomes fixed in its new ways and starts forward on its new course in life.", "It requires patience to await the development Burbank is a man of infinite patience.", "He has been five, ten, fifteen, twenty years in producing a desired blossom, but he considers himself well rewarded when his object has been obtained.", "Thousands of experiments are going on at the same time, but in each case years are required to achieve results, so slow is the work of selection, the rejecting of the seemingly worthless and the eternal choosing of the best specimens to continue the experiments.", "When two plants are united to produce a third, no human intelligence can predict just what will be the result of the union.", "There may be no result at all; hence it is that Burbank does not depend on one experiment at a time.", "If he did the labors of a life time would have little to show for their work.", "In breeding lilies he has used as high as five hundred thousand plants in a single test.", "Such an immense quantity gave him a great variety of selection.", "He culled and rejected, and culled and rejected until he made his final selection for the last test.", "Sometimes he is very much disappointed in his anticipations.", "For instance, he marks out a certain life for a flower and breeds and selects to that end.", "For a time all may go according to his plans, but suddenly some new trait develops which knocks those plans all out of gear.", "The new flower may have a longer stem and narrower leaves than either parent, while a shorter stem and broader leaves are the desideratum.", "The experimenter is disappointed, but not disheartened; he casts the flower aside and makes another selection from the same species and again goes ahead, until his object is attained.", "It may be asked how two plants are united to procure a third.", "The act is based on the procreative law of nature.", "Plant breeding is simply accomplished by sifting the pollen of one plant upon the stigma of another, this act  pollenation  resulting in fertilization, Nature in her own mysterious ways bringing forth the new plant.", "In order to get an idea of the Burbank method, let us consider some of his most famous experiments, for instance, that in which by uniting the potato with the tomato he has produced a new variety which has been very aptly named the pomato.", "Mr.", "Burbank, from the beginning of his wonderful career, has experimented much with the potato.", "It was this vegetable which first brought the plant wizard into worldwide prominence.", "The Burbank potato is known in all lands where the tuber forms an article of food.", "It has been introduced into Ireland and promises to be the salvation of that distressed island of which the potato constitutes the staple diet.", "The Burbank potato is the hardiest of all varieties and in this respect is well suited for the colder climates of the Temperate Zone.", "Apart from this potato which bears his name, Mr.", "Burbank has produced many other varieties.", "He has blended wild varieties with tame ones, getting very satisfactory results.", "Mr.", "Burbank believes that a little wild blood, so to speak, is often necessary to give tone and vigor to the tame element which has been long running in the same channels.", "Probably it was Emerson, his favorite author, who gave him the cue for this idea.", "Emerson pointed out that the city is recruited from the country.", "\"The city would have died out, rotted and exploded long ago,\" wrote the New England sage, \"but that it was reinforced from the fields.", "It is only country that came to town day before yesterday, that is city and court to day.\"", "In Burbank's greenhouses are mated all kinds of wild and tame varieties of potatoes, producing crosses and combinations truly wonderful as regards shape, size, and color.", "One of the most palatable potatoes he has produced is a magenta color approaching crimson, so distributed throughout that when the tuber is cut, no matter from what angle, it presents concentric geometric figures, some having a resemblance to human and animal faces.", "Before entering on any experiment to produce a new creation, Burbank always takes into consideration the practical end of the experiment, that is, what the value of the result will be as a practical factor in commerce, how much it will benefit the race.", "He does not experiment for a pastime or a novelty, but for a purpose.", "His object in regard to the potato is to make it a richer, better vegetable for a food supply and also to make it more important for other purposes in the commerce of the nations.", "The average potato consists of seventy five per cent.", "water and twenty five per cent.", "dry matter, almost all of which is starch.", "Now starch is a very important article from a manufacturing standpoint, but only one fourth of the potato is available for manufacturing, the other three fourths, being water, is practically waste matter.", "Now if the water could be driven out to a great extent and starchy matter increased it is easy to understand that the potato would be much increased in value as an article of manufacture.", "Burbank has not overlooked this fact in his potato experiments.", "He has demonstrated that it is as easy to breed potatoes for a larger amount of starch, and he has really developed tubers which contain at least twenty five per cent.", "more starch than the normal varieties; in other words, he has produced potatoes which yield fifty per cent.", "of starch instead of twenty five per cent.", "The United States uses about $12,000,000 worth of starch every year, chiefly obtained from Indian corn and potatoes.", "When the potato is made to yield double the amount of starch, as Burbank has proved it can yield and more, it will be understood what a large part it can be made to play in this important manufacture.", "Also for the production of alcohol the potato is gaining a prominent place.", "The potato starch is converted into maltose by the diastase of malt, the maltose being easily acted upon by ferment for the actual production of the alcohol.", "Therefore an increase in the starch of the potato for this purpose alone is much to be desired.", "Of course the chief prominence of the potato will still consist in its adaptability as an article of food.", "Burbank does not overlook this.", "He has produced and is producing potatoes with better flavor, of larger and uniform size and which give a much greater yield to the area.", "Palatability in the end decides the permanence of a food, and the Burbank productions possess this quality in a high degree.", "Burbank labored long and studied every characteristic of the potato before attempting any experiments with the tomato.", "Though closely related by family ties, the potato and the tomato seemed to have no affinity for each other whatever.", "In many other instances it has also been found that two varieties which from a certain relation might naturally be expected to amalgamate easily have been repellant to each other and refused to unite.", "In his first experiment in trying to cross the potato and tomato, Burbank produced tomatoes from the seeds of plants pollenated from potato pollen only.", "He next produced what he called \"aerial potatoes\" of very peculiar twisted shapes from a potato vine grafted on a Ponderosa or large tomato plant.", "Then reversing this operation he grafted the same kind of tomato plant upon the same kind of potato plant and produced underground a strange looking potato with marked tomato characteristics.", "He saw he was on the right road to the production of a new variety of vegetable, but before experimenting further along this line he crossed two distinct species of tomatoes and obtained a most ornamental plant, different from the parent stems, about twelve inches high and fifteen inches across with large unusual leaves and producing clusters of uniform globular fruit, the whole giving a most pleasing and unique appearance.", "The fruit were more palatable than the ordinary tomatoes, had better nutritive qualities and were more suitable for preserving and canning.", "Very pleased with this result he went back to his experiments with the potato tomato, and succeeded in producing the most wonderful and unique fruit in the world, one which by a happy combination of the two names, he has aptly called the pomato.", "It may be considered as the evolution of a potato seed ball.", "It first appears as a tiny green ball on the potato top and as the season progresses it gradually enlarges and finally develops into a fruit about the size and shape of the ordinary tomato.", "The flesh is white and the marrow, which contains but a few tiny white seeds, is exceedingly pleasant to the taste, possessing a combination of several different fruit flavors, though it cannot be identified with any one.", "It may be eaten either raw or cooked after the manner of the common tomato.", "In either case it is most palatable, but especially so when cooked.", "It is exceptionally well adapted to preserving purposes.", "The production of such a fruit from a vegetable is one of the crowning triumphs of the California wizard.", "Probably it is the most novel of all the wonderful crosses and combinations he has given to the world.", "It would be impossible here to go into detail in regard to some of the other wonders accomplished in the plant world by this modern magician.", "There is only space to merely mention a few more of his successful achievements.", "He has given the improved thornless and spiculess cactus, food for man and beast, converting it into a beautifier and reclaimer of desert wastes; the plum cot which is an amalgamation of the plum and the apricot with a flavor superior to both; many kinds of plums, some without pits, others having the taste of Bartlett pears, and still others giving out a fragrance as sweet as the rose; several varieties of walnuts, one with a shell as thin as paper and which was so easily broken by the birds that Burbank had to reverse his experiment somewhat in order to get a thicker shell; another walnut has no tannin in the meat, which is the cause of the disagreeable flavor of the ordinary fruit; the world famed Shasta daisy, which is a combination of the Japanese daisy, the English daisy and the common field daisy, and which has a blossom seven inches in diameter; a dahlia deprived of its unpleasant odor and the scent of the magnolia blossom substituted; a gladiolus which blooms around the entire stem like a hyacinth instead of the old way on one side only; many kinds of lilies with chalices and petals different from the ordinary, and exhaling perfumes as varied as those of Oriental gardens; a poppy of such dimension that it is from ten to twelve inches across its brilliant bloom; an amaryllis bred up from a couple of inches to over a foot in diameter; several kinds of fruit trees which withstand frost in bud and in flower; a chestnut tree which bears nuts in eighteen months from the time of seed planting; a white blackberry (paradoxical as it may appear), a rare and beautiful fruit and as palatable as it is beautiful; the primusberry, a union of the raspberry and the blackberry; another wonderful and delicious berry produced from the California dewberry and the Cuthbert raspberry; pieplants four feet in diameter, bearing every day in the year; prunes, three, four, and five times as large as the ordinary and enriched in flavor; blackberries without their prickly thorns and hundreds of other combinations and crosses of fruits and flowers too numerous to mention.", "He has improved plums, pears, apples, apricots, quinces, peaches, cherries, grapes, in short, all kinds of fruit which grow in our latitude and many even that have been introduced.", "He has developed hundreds of varieties of flowers, improving them in color, hardiness and yield.", "Thus he has not only added to the food and manufacturing products of the world, but he has enriched the aesthetic side in his beautiful flower creations.", "CHAPTER VIII  LATEST DISCOVERIES IN ARCHAEOLOGY    Prehistoric Time  Earliest Records  Discoveries in Bible Lands     American Explorations.", "For

remains of the city of Pumbaditha have been identified with the immense mound of Abnar some twenty miles from Babylon, on the banks of the Euphrates.", "This was the centre of Jewish scholarship during the Babylonian exile.", "One of the great schools in which the Talmud was composed was located here.", "The great psalm, \"By the waters of Babylon, we sat down and wept.\"", "was also composed on this spot, and here, too, Jeremiah and Isaiah thundered their impassioned eloquence.", "Broken tombs and a few inscribed bowls have been brought to light.", "Probably the original scrolls of the Talmud will be found here.", "Several curiously wrought vases and ruins have been also unearthed.", "Several monuments bearing inscriptions which are sorely puzzling the archaeologists have recently been unearthed at the site of Boghaz Keni which was the ancient, if not original capital, of the mysterious people called the Hittites who have been for so long a worry to Bible students.", "Archaeology has now revealed the secret of this people.", "There is no doubt they were of Mongolian origin, as the monuments just discovered represent them with slant eyes and pigtails.", "No one as yet has been able to read the inscriptions.", "They were great warriors, great builders and influenced the fate of many of the ancient nations.", "In many other places throughout these lands, deep students of Biblical lore are pushing on the work of excavation and daily adding to our knowledge concerning the peoples and nations in whom posterity must ever take a vital interest.", "A short time ago, Professor Doerpfeld announced to the world that he had discovered on the island of Ithaca, off the west coast of Greece, the ruins of the palace of Ulysses, Homer's half mythical hero of the _Odyssey_.", "The German archaeologist has traced the different rooms of the palace and is convinced that here is the very place to which the hero returned after his wanderings.", "Near it several graves were found from which were exhumed silver amulets, curiously wrought necklaces, bronze swords and metal ornaments bearing date 2,000 B.C., which is the date at which investigators lay the Siege of Troy.", "If the ruins be really those of the palace of Ulysses, some interesting things may be found to throw a light on the Homeric epic.", "As the schoolboys know, when Ulysses set sail from Troy for home, adverse winds wafted him to the coast of Africa and he beat around in the adjacent seas and visited islands and spent a considerable time meeting many kinds of curious and weird adventures, dallying at one time with the lotus eaters, at another braving the Cyclops, the one eyed monsters, until he arrived at Ithaca where \"he bent his bow and slew the suitors of Penelope, his harassed wife.\"", "In North America are mounds, earthworks, burial sites, shell heaps, buildings of stone and adobe, pictographs sculptured in rocks, stone implements, objects made of bone, pottery and other

  Tunnels  New York Subway  McAdoo Tunnels  How Tunnels are Built.", "The art of tunnel construction ranks among the very oldest in the world, if not the oldest, for almost from the beginning of his advent on the earth man has been tunneling and boring and making holes in the ground.", "Even in pre historic time, the ages of which we have neither record nor tradition, primitive man scooped out for himself hollows in the sides of hills, and mountains, as is evidenced by geological formations and by the fossils that have been unearthed.", "The forming of these hollows and holes was no indication of a superior intelligence but merely manifested the instincts of nature in seeking protection from the fury of the elements and safety from hostile forces such as the onslaughts of the wild and terrible beasts that then existed on the earth.", "The Cave Dwellers were real tunnelers, inasmuch as in construction of their rude dwellings they divided them into several compartments and in most cases chose the base of hills for their operations, boring right through from side to side as recent discoveries have verified.", "The ancient Egyptians built extensive tunnels for the tombs of their dead as well as for the temples of the living.", "When a king of Thebes ascended the throne he immediately gave orders for his tomb to be cut out of the solid rock.", "A separate passage or gallery led to the tomb along which he was to be borne in death to the final resting place.", "Some of the tunnels leading to the mausoleums of the ancient Egyptian kings were upwards of a thousand feet in length, hewn out of the hard solid rock.", "A similar custom prevailed in Assyria, Mesopotamia, Persia and India.", "The early Assyrians built a tunnel under the Euphrates river which was 12 feet wide by 15 high.", "The course of the river was diverted until the tunnel was built, then the waters were turned into their former channel, therefore it was not really a subaqueous tunnel.", "The sinking of tunnels under water was to be one of the triumphs of modern science.", "Unquestionably the Romans were the greatest engineers of ancient times.", "Much of their masonry work has withstood the disintegrating hand of time and is as solid and strong to day as when first erected.", "The \"Fire setting\" method of tunneling was originated by them, and they also developed the familiar principle of prosecuting the work at several points at the same time by means of vertical shafts.", "They heated the rock to be excavated by great fires built against the face of it.", "When a very high temperature was reached they turned streams of cold water on the heated stone with the result that great portions were disintegrated and fell off under the action of the water.", "The Romans being good chemists knew the effect of vinegar on lime, therefore when they encountered calcareous rock instead of water they used vinegar which very readily split up and disintegrated this kind of obstruction.", "The work of tunneling was very severe on the laborers, but the Romans did not care, for nearly all the workmen were slaves and regarded in no better light than so many cattle.", "One of the most notable tunnels constructed by the old Romans was that between Naples and Pozzuoli through the Posilipo Hills.", "It was excavated through volcanic tufa and was 3,000 feet long, 25 feet wide, and of the pointed arch style.", "The longest of the Roman tunnels, 3 1/2 miles, was built to drain Lake Fucino.", "It was driven through calcareous rock and is said to have cost the labor of 30,000 men for 11 years.", "Only hand labor was employed by the ancient people in their tunnel work.", "In soft ground the tools used were picks, shovels and scoops, but for rock work they had a greater variety.", "The ancient Egyptians besides the hammer, chisel and wedges had tube drills and saws provided with cutting edges of corundum or other hard gritty material.", "For centuries there was no progress in the art of tunneling.", "On the contrary there was a decline from the earlier construction until late in the 17th century when gunpowder came into use as an explosive in blasting rock.", "The first application of gunpowder was probably at Malpas, France, 1679 1681, in the construction of the tunnel on the line of the Languedoc Canal 510 feet long, 22 feet wide and 29 feet high.", "It was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that the art of tunnel construction, through sand, wet ground or under rivers was undertaken so as to come rightly under the head of practical engineering.", "In 1803 a tunnel was built through very soft soil for the San Quentin Canal in France.", "Timbering or strutting was employed to support the walls and roof of the excavation as fast as the earth was removed and the masonry lining was built closely following it.", "From the experience gained in this tunnel were developed the various systems of soft ground subterranean tunneling in practice at the present day.", "The first tunnel of any extent built in the United States was that known as the Auburn Tunnel near Auburn, Pa., for the water transportation of coal.", "It was several hundred feet long, 22 feet wide and 15 feet high.", "The first railroad tunnel in America was also in Pennsylvania on the Allegheny Portage Railroad, built in 1818 1821.", "It was 901 feet long, 25 feet wide and 21 feet high.", "What may be called the epoch making tunnel, the construction of which first introduced high explosives and power drills in this country, was the Hoosac in Massachusetts commenced in 1854 and after many interruptions brought to completion in 1876.", "It is a double track tunnel nearly 5 miles in length.", "It was quickly followed by the commencement of the Erie tunnel through Bergen Hill near Hoboken, N.J.", "This tunnel was commenced in 1855 and finished in 1861.", "It is 4,400 feet long, 28 feet wide and 21 feet high.", "Other remarkable engineering feats of this kind in America are the Croton Aqueduct Tunnel, the Hudson River Tunnel, and the New York Subway.", "The great rock tunnels of Europe are the four Alpine cuts known as Mont Cenis, St.", "Gothard, the Arlberg and the Simplon.", "The Mont Cenis is probably the most famous because at the time of its construction it was regarded as the greatest engineering achievement of the modern world, yet it is only a simple tunnel 8 miles long, while the Simplon is a double tunnel, each bore of which is 12 1/4 miles.", "The chief engineer of the Mont Cenis tunnel was M. Sommeiler, the man who devised the first power drill ever used in such work.", "In addition to the power drill the building of this tunnel induced the invention of apparatus to suck up foul air, the air compressor, the turbine and several other contrivances and appliances in use at the present time.", "Great strides in modern tunneling developed the \"shield\" and brought metal lining into service.", "The shield was invented and first used by Sir M. I. Brunel, a London engineer, in excavating the tunnel under the River Thames, begun in 1825 and finished in 1841.", "In 1869 another English engineer, Peter Barlow, used an iron lining in connection with a shield in driving the second tunnel under the Thames at London.", "From a use of the shield and metal lining has grown the present system of tunneling which is now universally known as the shield system.", "Great advancement has been made in the past few years in the nature and composition of explosives as well as in the form of motive power employed in blasting.", "Powerful chemical compositions, such as nitroglycerine and its compounds, such as dynamite, etc., have supplanted gunpowder, and electricity, is now almost invariably the firing agent.", "It also serves many other purposes in the work, illumination, supplying power for hoisting and excavating machinery, driving rock drills, and operating ventilating fans, etc.", "In this field, in fact, as everywhere else in the mechanical arts, the electric current is playing a leading part.", "To the English engineer, Peter Barlow, above mentioned, must be given the credit of bringing into use the first really serviceable circular shield for soft ground tunneling.", "In 1863 he took out a patent for such a shield with a cylindrical cast iron lining for the completed tunnel.", "Of course James Henry Greathead very materially improved the shield, so much so indeed that the present system of tunneling by means of circular shields is called the Greathead not the Barlow system.", "Greathead and Barlow entered into a partnership in 1869.", "They constructed the tunnel under the Tower of London 1,350 feet in length and seven feet in diameter which penetrated compact clay and was completed within a period of eleven months.", "This was a remarkable record in tunnel building for the time and won for these eminent engineers a world wide fame.", "From thenceforth their system came into vogue in all soft soil and subaqueous tunneling.", "Except for the development in steel apparatus and the introduction of electricity as a motive agent, there has not been such a great improvement on the Greathead shield as one would naturally expect in thirty years.", "The method of excavating a tunnel depends altogether on the nature of the obstruction to be removed for the passage.", "In the case of solid rock the work is slow but simple; dry, hard, firm earth is much the same as rock.", "The difficulties of tunneling lie in the soft ground, subaqueous mud, silt, quicksand, or any treacherous soil of a shifting, unsteady composition.", "When the rock is to be removed it is customary to begin the work in sections of which there may be seven or eight.", "First one section is excavated, then another and so on to completion.", "The order of the sections depends upon the kind of rock and upon the time allotted for the job and several other circumstances known to the engineer.", "If the first section attacked be at the top immediately beneath the arch of the proposed tunnel, next to the overlying matter, it is called a heading, but if the first cutting takes place at the bottom of the rock to form the base of the tunnel it is called a drift.", "Driving a heading is the most difficult operation of rock tunneling.", "Sometimes a heading is driven a couple of thousand feet ahead of the other sections.", "In soft rock it is often necessary to use timber props as the work proceeds and follow up the excavating by lining roof and sides with brick, stone or concrete.", "The rock is dislodged by blasting, the holes being drilled with compressed air, water force or electricity, and, as has been said, powerful explosives are used, nitroglycerine or some nitro compound being the most common.", "Many charges can be electrically fired at the same time.", "If the tunnel is to be long, shafts are sunk at intervals in order to attack the work at several places at once.", "Sometimes these shafts are lined and left open when the tunnel is completed for purposes of ventilation.", "In soft ground and subaqueous soil the \"shield\" is the chief apparatus used in tunneling.", "The most up to date appliance of this kind was that used in constructing the tunnels connecting New York City with New Jersey under the Hudson River.", "It consisted of a cylindrical shell of steel of the diameter of the excavation to be made.", "This was provided with a cutting edge of cast steel made up of assembled segments.", "Within the shell was arranged a vertical bulkhead provided with a number of doors to permit the passage of workmen, tools and explosives.", "The shell extended to the rear of the bulkhead forming what was known as the \"tail.\"", "The lining was erected within this tail and consisted of steel plates lined with masonry.", "The whole arrangement was in effect a gigantic circular biscuit cutter which was forced through the earth.", "The tail thus continually enveloped the last constructed portion of this permanent lining.", "The actual excavation took place in advance of the cutting edge.", "The method of accomplishing this, varied with conditions.", "At times the material would be rock for a few feet from the bottom, overlaid with soft earth.", "In such case the latter would be first excavated and then the roof would be supported by temporary timbers, after which the rock portion would be attacked.", "When the workmen had excavated the material in front of the shield it was passed through the heavy steel plate diaphragm in center of the shell out to the rear and the shield was then moved forward so as to bring its front again up to the face of the excavation.", "As the shell was very unwieldy, weighing about eighty tons, and, moreover, as the friction or pressure of the surrounding material on its side had to be overcome it was a very difficult matter to move it forward and a great force had to be expended to do so.", "This force was exerted by means of hydraulic jacks so devised and placed around the circumference of the diaphragm as to push against the completed steel plate lining of the tunnel.", "There were sixteen of these jacks employed with cylinders eight inches in diameter and they exerted a pressure of from one thousand to four thousand pounds per square inch.", "By such means the shield was pushed ahead as soon as room was made in front for another move.", "The purpose of the shield is to prevent the inrush of water and soft material while excavating is going on; the diaphragm of the shields acts as a bulkhead and the openings in it are so devised as to be quickly closed if necessary.", "The extension of the shield in front of the diaphragm is designed to prevent the falling or flowing in of the exposed face of the new excavation.", "The extension of the shell back from the diaphragm is for the purpose of affording opportunity to put in place the finished tunnel lining whatever it may be, masonry, cast iron, cast iron and masonry, or steel plates and masonry.", "Where the material is saturated with water as is the case in all subaqueous tunneling it is necessary to use compressed air in connection with the shield.", "The intensity of air pressure is determined by the depth of the tunnel below the surface of the water above it.", "The tunnelers work in what are called caissons to which they have access through an air lock.", "In many cases quick transition from the compressed air in the caisson to the open air at the surface results fatally to the workers.", "The caisson disease is popularly called \"the bends\" a kind of paralysis which is more or less baffling to medical science.", "Some men are able to bear a greater pressure than others.", "It depends on the natural stamina of the worker and his state of health.", "The further down the greater the pressure.", "The normal atmospheric pressure at the surface is about fourteen pounds to the square inch.", "Men in normal health should be able to stand a pressure of seventy six pounds to the square inch and this would call for a depth of 178 feet under water surface, which far exceeds any depth worked under compressed air.", "For a long time one hundred feet were regarded as a maximum depth and at that depth men were not permitted to work more than an hour in one shift.", "The ordinary subaqueous tunnel pressure is about forty five pounds and this corresponds to a head of 104 feet.", "In working in the Hudson Tunnels the pressure was scarcely ever above thirty three pounds, yet many suffered from the \"bends.\"", "What is called a freezing method is now proposed to overcome the water in soft earth tunneling.", "Its chief feature is the excavating first of a small central tunnel to be used as a refrigerating chamber or ice box in freezing the surrounding material solid so that it can be dug out or blasted out in chunks the same as rock.", "It is very doubtful however, if such a plan is feasible.", "The greatest partly subaqueous tunnels in the world are now to be found in the vicinity of New York.", "The first to be opened to the public is known as the Subway and extends from the northern limits of the City in Westchester County to Brooklyn.", "The oldest, however, of the New York tunnels counting from its origin is the \"McAdoo\" tunnel from Christopher Street, in Manhattan Borough, under the Hudson to Hoboken.", "This was begun in 1880 and continued at intervals as funds could be obtained until 1890, when the work was abandoned after about two thousand feet had been constructed.", "For a number of years the tunnel remained full of water until it was finally acquired by the Hudson Companies who completed and opened it to the public in 1908.", "Another tunnel to the foot of Cortlandt Street was constructed by the same concern and opened in 1909.", "Both tunnels consist of parallel but separate tubes.", "The railway tunnels to carry the Pennsylvania R. R. under the Hudson into New York and thence under the East River to Long Island have been finished and are great triumphs of engineering skill besides making New York the most perfectly equipped city in the world as far as transit is concerned.", "The greatest proposed subaqueous tunnel is that intended to connect England with France under the English Channel a distance of twenty one miles.", "Time and again the British Parliament has rejected proposals through fear that such a tunnel would afford a ready means of invasion from a foreign enemy.", "However, it is almost sure to be built.", "Another projected British tunnel is one which will link Ireland and Scotland under the Irish Sea.", "If this is carried out then indeed the Emerald Isle will be one with Britain in spite of her unwillingness for such a close association.", "England already possesses a famous subaqueous tunnel in that known as the Severn tunnel under the river of that name.", "It is four and a half miles long, although it was built largely through rock.", "Water gave much trouble in its construction which occupied thirteen years from 1873 to 1886.", "Pumps were employed to raise the water through a side heading connecting with a shaft twenty nine feet in diameter.", "The greatest amount of water raised concurrently was twenty seven million gallons in twenty four hours but the pumps had a capacity of sixty six million gallons for the same time.", "The greatest tunnel in Europe is the Simplon which connects Switzerland with Italy under the Simplon Pass in the Alps.", "It has two bores twelve and one fourth miles each and at places it is one and one half miles below the surface.", "The St.", "Gothard also connecting Switzerland and Italy under the lofty peak of the Col de St.", "Gothard is nine and one fourth miles in length.", "The third great Alpine tunnel, the Arlberg, which is six and one half miles long, forms a part of the Austrian railway between Innsbruck and Bluedenz in the Tyrol and connects westward with the Swiss railroads and southward with those of Italy.", "Two great tunnels at the present time are being constructed in the United States, one of these which is piercing the backbone of the Rockies is on the Atlantic and Pacific railway.", "It begins near Georgetown, will pass under Gray's peak and come out near Decatur, Colorado, in all a length of twelve miles.", "The other American undertaking is a tunnel under the famous Pike's Peak in Colorado which when completed will be twenty miles long.", "It can clearly be seen that in the way of tunnel engineering Uncle Sam is not a whit behind his European competitors.", "CHAPTER X  ELECTRICITY IN THE HOUSEHOLD    Electrically Equipped Houses  Cooking by Electricity  Comforts and

thoroughly equipped with electricity from top to bottom that one servant is able to do what formerly required the service of several, and in some houses servants seem to be needed hardly at all, the mistresses doing their own cooking, ironing, and washing by means of electricity.", "In respect to taking advantage of electricity to perform the duties of the household our friends in Europe were ahead of us, though America is pre eminently the land of electricity  the natal home of the science.", "We are waking up, however, to the domestic utility of this agent and throughout the country at present there are numbers of homes in which electricity is employed to perform almost every task automatically from feeding the baby to the crimping of my lady's hair in her scented boudoir.", "There is now no longer any use for chimneys on electrically equipped houses, for the fires have been eliminated and all heat and light drawn from the electric street mains.", "A description of one of these houses is most interesting as showing what really can be accomplished by this wonderful source of power.", "Before the visitor to such a house reaches the gate or front door his approach is made known by an annunciator in the hall, which is connected with a hidden plate in the entrance path, which when pressed by the feet of the visitor charges the wire of the annunciator.", "A voice comes through the horn of a phonograph asking him what he wishes and telling him to reply through the telephone which hangs at the side of the door.", "When he has made his wants known, if he is welcome or desired, there is a click and the door opens.", "As he enters an electrically operated door mat cleans his shoes and if he is aware of the equipments of the house, he can have his clothes brushed by an automatic brush attached to the hat rack in the hall.", "An escalator or endless stairway brings him to the first floor where he is met by the host who conducts him to the den sacred to himself.", "If he wishes a preprandial cigar, the host touches a segment of the wall, apparently no different in appearance from the surrounding surface, and a complete cigar outfit shoots out to within reach of the guest.", "When the gong announces dinner he is conducted to the dining hall where probably the uses to which electricity can be put are better exemplified than in any other part of the house.", "Between this room and the kitchen there is a perfect electric understanding.", "The apartments are so arranged that electric dumbwaiter service is operated between the centre of the dining table itself and the serving table in the kitchen.", "The latter is equipped with an electric range provided with electrically heated ovens, broilers, vegetable cookers, saucepans, dishes, etc., sufficient for the preparation of the most elaborate house banquet.", "The chef or cook in charge of the kitchen prepares each dish in its proper oven and has it ready waiting on the electric elevator at the appointed time when the host and his guest or guests, or family, as the case may be, are seated at the dining table.", "The host or whoever presides at the head of the table merely touches a button concealed on the side of the mahogany and the elevator instantly appears through a trap door in the table, which is ordinarily closed by two silver covers which look like a tray.", "In this way the dish seemingly miraculously appears right on top of the table.", "When each guest is served it returns to the kitchen by the way it came and a second course is brought on the table in a similar manner and so on until the dinner is fully served.", "Fruits and flowers tastefully arranged adorn the centre of the dining table and minute electric incandescent lamps of various colors are concealed in the roses and petals and these give a very pretty effect, especially at night.", "Beneath the table nothing is to be seen but two nickel plated bars which serve to guide the elevators.", "Down in the kitchen the cooking is carried on almost mechanically by means of an electric clock controlling the heating circuits to the various utensils.", "The cook, knowing just how long each dish will require to be cooked, turns on the current at the proper time and then sets the clock to automatically disconnect that utensil when sufficient time, so many minutes to the pound, has elapsed.", "When this occurs a little electric bell rings, calling attention to the fact, that the heat has been shut off.", "Another kitchen accessory is a rotating table on which are mounted various household machines such as meat choppers, cream whippers, egg beaters and other apparatus all electrically operated.", "There is also an electric dishwasher and dryer and plate rack manipulator which places the dishes in position when clean and dried.", "The advantages of cooking by electricity are apparent to all who have tested them.", "Food cooked in an electric baking oven is much superior than when cooked by any other method because of the better heat regulation and the utter cleanliness, there being absolutely no dust whatever as in the case when coal is used.", "The electric oven does not increase the temperature nor does it exhaust the pure air in the room by burning up the oxygen.", "The time required for cooking is about the same as with coal.", "The perfect cleanliness of an electric plate warmer is sufficient to warrant its use.", "It keeps dishes at a uniform temperature and the food does not get scorched and become tough.", "Steaks prepared on electric gridirons and broilers are really delicious as they are evenly done throughout and retain all the natural juices of the meat; there is no odor of gas or of the fire and portions done to a crisp while others are raw on the inside.", "In toasting there is no danger of the bread burning on one side more than on the other, or of its burning on either side and a couple of dozen slices can be done together on an ordinary instrument at the same time.", "The electric diskstove, flat on the top, like a ball cut in two, can be also utilized as a toaster or for heating any kettles or pots or vessels with flat bottoms.", "Very appetizing waffles are made with electric waffle irons, because the bottom and top irons are uniformly heated, so that the irons cook the waffles from both sides at the same time.", "Electric potato peeling machines consist of a stationary cylinder opened at the top for the reception of the potatoes and having a revolving disk at the bottom.", "The cylinder has a rough surface or is coated with diamond flint, so that when the disk revolves the potatoes are thrown against the sides of the cylinder and the skin is scraped off.", "There is no deep cutting as when peeled by a knife, therefore, much waste is avoided.", "While the potatoes are being scraped, a stream of water plays upon them taking away the skins and thoroughly cleansing the tubers.", "Among other electric labor savers connected with the culinary department may be mentioned floor scrubbers, dish washers, coffee grinders, meat choppers, dough mixers and cutlery polishers, all of which give complete satisfaction at a paltry cost and save much time and labor.", "A small motor can drive any of these instruments or several can be attached and run by the same motor.", "The operation of an ordinary snap switch will supply energy to electric water heaters attached to the kitchen boiler or to the faucet.", "The instantaneous water heater also purifies the water by killing the bacteria contained in it.", "The electric tea kettle makes a brew to charm the heart of a connossieur.", "In fact all cooking done by electricity whether it is the frying of an egg or the roasting of a steak is superior in every way to the old methods and what accentuates its use is the cleanliness with which it can be performed.", "And it should be taken into consideration that in electric cooking there is no bending over hot stoves and ranges or a stuffy evil smelling smoky atmosphere, but on the contrary, fresh air, cleanliness and coolness which make cooking not the drudgery it has ever been, but a real pleasure.", "Let us take a glance at the laundry in the electrically equipped house.", "There is a large tub with a wringer attached to it and a simple mechanism by which a small motor can either be connected with the tub or the wringer as required.", "The washing is performed entirely by the motor and in a way prevents the wear and tear associated with the old method of scrubbing and rubbing done at the expense of much \"elbow grease.\"", "The motor turns the tub back and forth and in this way the soapy water penetrates the clothes, thus removing the dirt without injuring or tearing the fabric.", "In the old way, the clothes were moved up and down in the water and torn and worn in the process.", "By the new way it is the water which moves while the clothes remain stationary.", "When the clothes are thoroughly washed, the motor is attached to the wringer and they are passed through it; they are completely dried by a specially constructed electric fan.", "Whatever garments are to be ironed are separated and fed to a steel roll mangle operated by a motor which gives them a beautiful finish.", "The electric flat iron plays also an important part in the laundry as it is clean and never gets too hot nor too cold and there is no rushing back to replenish the heaters.", "One is not obliged to remain in the room with a hot stove, and suffer the inconveniences.", "No heat is felt at all from the iron as it is all concentrated on the bottom surface.", "It is a regular blessing to the laundress especially in hot weather.", "There is a growing demand in all parts of the country for these electric flat irons.", "Electricity plays an important role in the parlor and drawing room.", "The electric fireplace throws out a ruddy glow, a perfect imitation of the wide open old fashioned fireplaces of the days of our grandmothers.", "There are small grooves at certain sections in the flooring over which chairs and couches can be brought to a desired position.", "When the master drops into his favorite chair by the fireplace if he wishes a tune to soothe his jangled nerves, there is an electric attachment to the piano and he can adjust it to get the air of his choice without having to ask any one to play for him.", "In the drawing room an electric fountain may be playing, its jets reflecting the prismatic colors of the rainbow as the waters fall in iridescent sparkle among the lights.", "Such a fountain is composed of a small electric motor and a centrifugal pump, the latter being placed in the interior of a basin and connected directly to the motor shaft.", "The pump receives the water from the basin and conveys it through pipes and a number of small nozzles thus producing cascades.", "The water falling upon an art glass dome, beneath which are small incandescent lamps, returns to the basin and thence again to the pump.", "There is no necessity of filling the fountain until the water gets low through evaporation.", "When the lights are not in colored glass, the water may be colored and this gives the same effect.", "To produce the play of the fountain and its effects, it is only necessary to connect it to any circuit and turn on the switch.", "The dome revolves by means of a jet of water driven against flanges on the under side of the rim of the dome and in this way beautiful and prismatic effects are produced.", "The motor is noiseless in operation.", "In addition to the pretty effect the fountain serves to cool and moisten the air of the room.", "The sleeping chambers are thoroughly equipped.", "Not only the rooms may be heated by electricity but the beds themselves.", "An electric pad consisting of a flexible resistance covered with soft felt is connected by a conductor cord to a plug and is used for heating beds or if the occupant is suffering from rheumatism or indigestion or any intestinal pain this pad can be used in the place of the hot water bottle and gives greater satisfaction.", "There is a heat controlling device and the circuit can be turned on or off at will.", "There are many more curious devices in the electrically equipped house which could they have been exhibited a generation or so ago, would have condemned the owner as a sorcerer and necromancer of the dark ages, but which now only place him in the category of the smart ones who are up to date and take advantage of the science and progress of the time.", "CHAPTER XI  HARNESSING THE WATER FALL    Electric Energy  High Pressure  Transformers  Development of   Water power.", "The electrical transmission of power is exemplified in everything which is based on the generation of electricity.", "The ordinary electric light is power coming from a generator in the building or a public street dynamo.", "However, when we talk in general terms of electric transmission we mean the transmission of energy on a large scale by means of overhead or underground conductors to a considerable distance and the transformation of this energy into light and heat and chemical or mechanical power to carry on the processes of work and industry.", "When the power or energy is conveyed a long distance from the generator, say over 30 miles or more, we usually speak of the system of supply as long distance transmission of electric energy.", "In many cases power is conveyed over distances of 200 miles and more.", "When water power is available as at Niagara, the distance to which electric energy can be transmitted is considerably increased.", "The distance to a great extent depends on the cost of coal required for generation at the distributing point and on the amount of energy demanded at the receiving point.", "Of course the farther the distance the higher must be the voltage pressure.", "Electrical engineers say that under proper conditions electric energy may be transmitted in large quantity to a distance of 500 miles and more at a pressure of about 170,000 volts.", "If such right conditions be established then New York, Chicago and several other of our large cities can get their power from Niagara.", "In our cities and towns where the current has only to go a short distance from the power house, the conductors are generally placed in cables underground and the maximum electro motive force scarcely ever exceeds 11,000 volts.", "This pressure is generated by a steam driven alternating current generator and is transmitted over the conductors to sub stations, where by means of step down transformers, the pressure is dropped to, say, 600 volts alternating current which by rotary converters is turned into direct current for the street mains, for feeders of railways and for charging storage batteries which in turn give out direct current at times of heavy demand.", "That electric transmission of energy to long distances may be successfully carried out transformers are necessary for raising the pressure on the transmission line and for reducing it at the points of distribution.", "The transformer consists of a magnetic circuit of laminated iron or mild steel interlinked with two electric circuits, one, the primary, receiving electrical energy and the other the secondary, delivering it to the consumer.", "The effect of the iron is to make as many as possible of the lines of force set up by the primary current, cut the secondary winding and there set up an electromotive force of the same frequency but different voltage.", "The transformer has made long distance the actual achievement that it is.", "It is this apparatus that brought the mountain to Mohammed.", "Without it high pressure would be impossible and it is on high pressure that success of long distance transmission depends.", "To convey electricity to distant centres at a low pressure would require thousands of dollars in copper cables alone as conductors.", "To illustrate the service of the transformer in electricity it is only necessary to consider water power at a low pressure.", "In such a case the water can only be transmitted at slow speed and through great openings, like dams or large canals, and withal the force is weak and of little practical efficiency, whereas under high pressure a small quantity can be forced through a small pipe and create an energy beyond comparison to that developed when under low pressure.", "The transformer raises the voltage and sends the electrical current under high pressure over a small wire and so great is this pressure that thousands of horse power can be sent to great distances over small wires with very little loss.", "Water power is now changed to electrical power and transmitted over slender copper wires to the great manufacturing centres of our country to turn the wheels of industry and give employment to thousands.", "Nearly one hundred cities in the United States alone are today using electricity supplied by transmitted water power.", "Ten years ago Niagara Falls were regarded only as a great natural curiosity of interest only to the sightseer, today those Falls distribute over 100,000 horse power to Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester, Toronto and several smaller cities and towns.", "Wild Niagara has at last indeed been harnessed to the servitude of man.", "Spier Falls north of Saratoga, practically unheard of before, is now supplying electricity to the industrial communities of Schenectady, Troy, Amsterdam, Albany and half a dozen or so smaller towns.", "Rivers and dams, lakes and falls in all parts of the country are being utilized to supply energy, though at the present time only about one fortieth of the horse power available through this agent is being made productive.", "The water conditions of the United States are so favorable that 200,000,000 horse power could be easily developed, but as it is we have barely enough harnessed to supply 5 million horse power.", "Eighty per cent.", "of the power used at the present time is produced from fuel.", "This percentage is sure to decrease in the future for fuel will become scarcer and the high cost will drive fuel power altogether out of the market.", "New York State has the largest water power development in the Union, the total being 885,862 horsepower; this fact is chiefly owing to the energy developed by Niagara.", "The second State in water power development is California, the total development being 466,774 horsepower over 1,070 wheels or a unit installation of about 436 H.P.", "The third State is Maine with 343,096 horse power, over 2,707 wheels or an average of about 123 horse power per wheel.", "Lack of space makes it impossible to enter upon a detailed description of the structural and mechanical features of the various plants and how they were operated for the purpose of turning water into an electric current.", "The best that can be done is to outline the most noteworthy features which typify the various situations under which power plants are developed and operated.", "The water power available under any condition depends principally upon two factors  First, the amount of fall or hydrostatic head on the wheels; second, the amount of water that can be turned over the wheels.", "The conditions vary according to place, there are all kinds of fall and flow.", "To develop a high power it is necessary to discharge a large volume of water upon properly designed wheels.", "In many of the western plants where only a small amount of water is available there is a great fall to make up for the larger volume in force coming down upon the wheels.", "So far as actual energy is concerned it makes no difference whether we develop a certain amount of power by allowing twenty cubic feet of water per second to fall a distance of one foot or allow one cubic foot of water per second to fall a distance of twenty feet.", "In one place we may have a plant developing say 10,000 horse power with a fall of anywhere from twenty to forty feet and in another place a plant of the same capacity with a fall of 1,000, 1,500 or 2,000 feet.", "In the former case the short fall is compensated by a great volume of water to produce such a horse power, while in the latter converse conditions prevail.", "In many cases the power house is located some distance from the source of supply and from the point where the water is diverted from its course by artificial means.", "The Shawinigan Falls of St.", "Maurice river in Canada occur at two points a short distance apart, the fall at one point being about 50 and at the other 100 feet high.", "A canal 1,000 feet long takes water from the river above the upper of these falls and delivers it near to the electric power house on the river bank below the lower falls.", "In this way a hydrostatic head of 125 feet is obtained at the power house.", "The canal in this case ends on high ground 130 feet from the power house and the water passes down to the wheels through steel penstocks 9 feet in diameter.", "In a great many cases in level country the water power can only be developed by means of such canals or pipe lines and the generating stations must be situated away from the points where the water is diverted from its course.", "In mountainous country where rivers are comparatively small and their courses are marked by numerous falls and rapids, it is generally necessary to utilize the fall of a stream through some miles of its length in order to get a satisfactory development of power.", "To reach this result rather long canals, flumes, or pipe lines must be laid to convey the water to the power stations and deliver it at high pressure.", "California offers numerous examples of electric power development with the water that has been carried several miles through artificial channels.", "An illustration of this class of work exists at the electric power house on the bank of the Mokelumne river in the Sierra Nevada mountains.", "Water is supplied to the wheels in this station under a head of 1,450 feet through pipes 3,600 feet long leading to the top of a near by hill.", "To reach this hill the water after its diversion from the Mokelumne river at the dam, flows twenty miles through a canal or ditch and then through 3,000 feet of wooden stave pipe.", "Although California ranks second in water power development it is easily the first in the number of its stations, and also be it said, California was the first to realize the possibilities of long distance electrical energy.", "The line from the 15,000 horsepower plant at Colgate in this State to San Francisco by way of Mission San Jose, where it is supplied with additional power, has a length of 232 miles and is the longest transmission of electrical energy in the world.", "The power house at Colgate has a capacity of 11,250 kilowatts in generators, but it is uncertain what part of the output is transmitted to San Francisco, as there are more than 100 substations on the 1,375 miles of circuit in this system.", "Another system, even greater than the foregoing which has just been completed is that of the Stanislaus plant in Tuolumme County, California, from which a transmission line on steel towers has been run in Tuolumme, Calaveras, San Joaquin, Alameda and Contra Costa Counties for the delivery of power to mines and to the towns lying about San Francisco Bay.", "The rushing riotous waters of the Stanislaus wasted for so many centuries have been saved by the steel paddles of gigantic turbine water wheels and converted into electricity which carries with the swiftness of thought thousands of horse power energy to the far away cities and towns to be transformed into light and heat and power to run street cars and trains and set in motion the mechanism of mills and factories and make the looms of industry hum with the bustle and activity of life.", "It is said that the greatest long distance transmission yet attempted will shortly be undertaken in South Africa where it is proposed to draw power from the famous Victoria Falls.", "The line from the Falls will run to Johannesburg and through the Rand, a length of 700 miles.", "It is claimed the Falls are capable of developing 300,000 electric horse power at all times.", "Should this undertaking be accomplished it will be a crowning achievement in electrical science.", "CHAPTER XII  WONDERFUL WARSHIPS    Dimensions, Displacements, Cost and Description of Battleships     Capacity and Speed  Preparing for the Future.", "All modern battleships are of steel construction.", "The basis of all protection on these vessels is the protective deck, which is also common to the armored cruiser and many varieties of gunboats.", "This deck is of heavy steel covering the whole of the vessel a little above the water line in the centre; it slopes down from the centre until it meets the sides of the vessel about three feet below the water; it extends the entire length of the ship and is firmly secured at the ends to the heavy stem and stern posts.", "Underneath this deck are the essentials of the vessel, the boilers and machinery, the magazines and shell rooms, the ammunition cells and all the explosive paraphernalia which must be vigilantly safe guarded against the attacks of the enemy.", "Every precaution is taken to insure safety.", "All openings in the protective deck above are covered with heavy steel gratings to prevent fragments of shell or other combustible substances from getting through to the magazine or powder cells.", "The heaviest armor is usually placed at the water line because it is this part of the ship which is the most vulnerable and open to attack and where a shell or projectile would do the most harm.", "If a hole were torn in the side at this place the vessel would quickly take in water and sink.", "On this account the armor is made thick and is known as the water line belt.", "At the point where the protective deck and the ship's side meet, there is a projection or ledge on which this armor belt rests.", "Thus it goes down about three feet below the water and it extends to the same distance above.", "The barbettes, that is, the parapets supporting the gun turrets, are one forward and one aft.", "They rest upon the protective deck at the bottom and extend up about four feet above the upper deck.", "At the top of the barbettes, revolving on rollers, are the turrets, sometimes called the hoods, containing the guns and the leading mechanism and all of the machinery in connection with the same.", "The turret ammunition hoists lead up from the magazine below, delivering the charges and projectiles for the guns at the very breach so that they can be loaded immediately.", "An athwartship line of armor runs from the water line to the barbettes, resting upon the protective deck.", "In fact, the space between the protective and upper deck is so closed in with armor, with a barbette at each end, that it is like a citadel or fort or some redoubt well guarded from the enemy.", "Resting upon the water belt and the athwartship or diagonal armor, and following the same direction is a layer of armor usually somewhat thinner which is called the lower case mate armor; it extends up to the lower edge of the broadside gun ports, and resting upon it in turn is the upper case mate armor, following the same direction, and forming the protection for the broadside battery.", "The explosive effect of the modern shell is so tremendous that were one to get through the upper case mate and explode immediately after entering, it would undoubtedly disable several guns and kill their entire crews; it is, therefore, usual to isolate each broadside gun from its neighbors by light nickel steel bulkheads a couple of inches or so thick, and to prevent the same disastrous result among the guns on the opposite side, a fore and aft bulkhead of about the same thickness is placed on the centre line of the ship.", "Each gun of the broadside battery is thus mounted in a space by itself somewhat similar to a stall.", "Abaft the forward turret there is a vertical armored tube resting on the protective deck and at its upper end is the conning tower, from which the ship is worked when in action and which is well safe guarded.", "The tube protects all the mechanical signalling gear running into the conning tower from which communication can be had instantly with any part of the vessel.", "To build a battleship that will be practically unsinkable by the gun fire of an enemy it is only necessary to make the water belt armor thick enough to resist the shells, missiles and projectiles aimed at it.", "There is another essential that is equally important, and that is the protection of the batteries.", "The experience of modern battles has made it manifest, that it is impossible for the crew to do their work when exposed to a hail of shot and shell from a modern battery of rapid fire and automatic guns.", "And so in all more recently built battleships and armored cruisers and gunboats, the protection of broadside batteries and exposed positions has been increased even at the expense of the water line belt.", "Armor plate has been much improved in recent years.", "During the Civil War the armor on our monitors was only an inch thick.", "Through such an armor the projectiles of our time would penetrate as easily as a bullet through a pine board.", "It was the development of gun power and projectiles that called forth the thick armor, but it was soon found that it was impossible for the armor to keep pace with the deadliness of the guns as it was utterly impossible to carry the weight necessary to resist the force of impact.", "Then came the use of special plates, the compound armor where a hard face to break up the projectile was welded to a softer back to give the necessary strength.", "This was followed by the steel armor treated by the Harvey process; it was like the compound armor in having a hard face and a soft back, but the plates were made from a single ingot without any welding.", "The Harvey process enabled an enormously greater resistance to be obtained with a given weight of armor, but even it has been surpassed by the Krupp process which enables twelve inches of thickness to give the same resistance as fifteen of Harveyized plates.", "The armament or battery of warships is divided into two classes, viz., the main and the second batteries.", "The main battery comprises the heaviest guns on the ship, those firing large shell and armor piercing projectiles, while the second battery consists of small rapid fire and machine guns for use against torpedo boats or to attack the unprotected or lightly protected gun positions of an enemy.", "The main battery of our modern battleships consists usually of ten twelve inch guns, mounted in pairs on turrets in the centre of the ship.", "In addition to these heavy guns it is usual to mount a number of smaller ones of from five to eight inches diameter of bore on each broadside, although sometimes they are mounted on turrets like the larger guns.", "A twelve inch breech loading gun, fifty calibers long and weighing eighty three tons, will propel a shell weighing eight hundred and eighty pounds, by a powder charge of six hundred and twenty four pounds, at a velocity of over two thousand six hundred and twenty feet per second, giving an energy at the muzzle of over forty thousand foot tons and is capable of penetrating at the muzzle, forty five inches of iron.", "During the last few years, very large increases have been made in the dimensions, displacements and costs of battleships and armored cruisers as compared with vessels of similar classes previously constructed.", "Both England and the United States have constructed enormous war vessels within the past decade.", "The British _Dreadnought_ built in nineteen hundred and five has a draft of thirty one feet six inches and a displacement of twenty two thousand and two hundred tons.", "Later, vessels of the _Dreadnought_ type have a normal draft of twenty seven feet and a naval displacement of eighteen thousand and six hundred tons.", "Armored cruisers of the British _Invincible_ class have a draft of twenty six feet and a displacement of seventeen thousand two hundred and fifty tons with a thousand tons of coal on board.", "These cruisers have engines developing forty one thousand horse power.", "Within the past two years the United States has turned out a few formidable battleships, which it is claimed surpass the best of those of any other navy in the world.", "The _Delaware_ and _North Dakota_ each have a draft of twenty six feet, eleven inches and a displacement of twenty thousand tons.", "Great interest attached to the trials of these vessels because they were sister ships fitted with different machinery and it was a matter of much speculation which would develop the greater speed.", "In addition to the consideration of the battleship as a fighting machine at close quarters, Uncle Sam is trying to have her as fleet as an ocean greyhound should an enemy heave in sight so that the latter would not have much opportunity to show his heels to a broadside.", "The _Delaware_, which has reciprocating engines, exceeded her contract speed of twenty one knots on her runs over a measured mile course in Penobscot Bay on October 22 and 23, 1909.", "Three runs were made at the rate of nineteen knots, three at 20.50 knots, and five at 21.98 knots.", "The _North Dakota_ is furnished with Curtis turbine engines.", "Here is a comparison of

in fact this name is still applied to this kind of ordnance.", "By the end of the fifteenth century a great advancement was shown in the make of these implements of warfare.", "Bronze and brass as materials came into general use and cannon were turned out with twenty to twenty five inch bore weighing twenty tons and capable of hurling to a considerable distance projectiles weighing from two hundred pounds to one thousand pounds with powder as the propelling force.", "In a short time these large guns were mounted and carriages were introduced to facilitate transportation with troops.", "Meantime stone projectiles were replaced by cast iron shot, which, owing to its greater density, necessitated a reduction in calibre, that is a narrowing of the bore, consequently lighter and smaller guns came into the field, but with a greater propelling force.", "When the cast iron balls first came into use as projectiles, they weighed about twelve pounds, hence the cannons shooting them were known as twelve pounders.", "It was soon found, however, that twelve pounds was too great a weight for long distances, so a reduction took place until the missiles were cut down to four pounds and the cannon discharging these, four pounders as they were called, weighed about one quarter of a ton.", "They were very effective and handy for light field work.", "The eighteenth century witnessed rapid progress in gun and ammunition manufacture.", "\"Grape\" and \"canister\" were introduced and the names still cling to the present day.", "Grape consisted of a number of tarred lead balls, held together in a net.", "Canister consisted of a number of small shot in a tin can, the shots being dispersed by the breaking of the can on discharge.", "Grape now consists of cast iron balls arranged in three tiers by means of circular plates, the whole secured by a pin which passes through the centre.", "The number of shot in each tier varies from three to five.", "Grape is very destructive up to three hundred yards and effective up to six hundred yards.", "Canister shot as we know it at present, is made up of a number of iron balls, placed in a tin cylinder with a wooden bottom, the size of the piece of ordnance for which it is intended.", "Towards the close of the eighteenth century, short cast iron guns called \"carronades\" were introduced by Gascoigne of the Cannon Iron Works, Scotland.", "They threw heavy shots at low velocity with great battery effect.", "They were for a long time in use in the British navy.", "The sailors called them \"smashers.\"", "The entire battery of the Victory, Nelson's famous flag ship at the battle of Trafalgar, amounting to a total of 102 guns, was composed of \"carronades\" varying in size from thirty two to sixty eight pounders.", "They were mounted on wooden truck carriages and were given elevation by handspikes applied under the breech, a quoin or a wedge shaped piece of wood being pushed in to hold the breech up in position.", "They were trained by handspikes with the aid of side tackle and their recoil was limited by a stout rope, called the breeching, the ends of which were secured to the sides of the ship.", "The slow match was used for firing, the flint lock not being applied to naval guns until 1780.", "About the middle of the nineteenth century, the design of guns began to receive much scientific thought and consideration.", "The question of high velocities and flat trajectories without lightening the weight of the projectile was the desideratum; the minimum of weight in the cannon itself with the maximum in the projectile and the force with which it could be propelled were the ends to be attained.", "In 1856 Admiral Dahlgren of the United States Navy designed the _Dahlgren_ gun with shape proportioned to the \"curve of pressure,\" which is to say that the gun was heavy at the breech and light at the muzzle.", "This gun was well adapted to naval use at the time.", "From this, onward, guns of high pressure were manufactured until the pressure grew to such proportions that it exceeded the resisting power, represented by the tensile strength of cast iron.", "When cast, the gun cooled from the outside inwardly, thus placing the inside metal in a state of tension and the outside in a state of compression.", "General Rodman, Chief of Ordnance of the United States Army, came forward with a remedy for this.", "He suggested the casting of guns hollow and the cooling of them from the inside outwardly by circulating a stream of cold water in the bore while the outside surface was kept at a high temperature.", "This method placed the metal inside in a state of compression and that on the outside in a state of tension, the right condition to withstand successfully the pressure of the powder gas, which tended to expand the inner portions beyond the normal diameter and throw the strain of the supporting outer layers.", "This system was universally employed and gave the best results obtainable from cast iron for many years and was only superseded by that of \"built up\" guns, when iron and steel were made available by improved processes of production.", "The great strides made in the manufacture and forging of steel during the past quarter of a century, the improved tempering and annealing processes have resulted in the turning out of big guns solely composed of steel.", "The various forms of modern ordnance are classified and named according to size and weight, kind of projectiles used and their velocities; angle of elevation at which they are fired; use; and mode of operation.", "The guns known as breechloading rifles are from three inches to fourteen inches in calibre, that is, across the bore, and in length from twelve to over sixty feet.", "They weigh from one ton to fifty tons.", "They fire solid shot or shells weighing up to eleven hundred pounds at high velocities, from twenty three to twenty five hundred feet per second.", "They can penetrate steel armor to a depth of fifteen to twenty inches at 2,000 yards distance.", "Rapid fire guns are those in which the operation of opening and closing the breech is performed by a single motion of a lever actuated by the hand, and in which the explosive used is closed in a metallic case.", "These guns are made in various forms and are operated by several different systems of breech mechanism generally named after their respective inventors.", "The Vickers Maxim and the Nordenfeldt are the best known in America.", "A new type of the Vickers Maxim was introduced in 1897 in which a quick working breech mechanism automatically ejects the primer and draws up the loading tray into position as the breech is opened.", "This type was quickly adopted by the United States Navy and materially increased the speed of fire in all calibres.", "What are known as machine guns are rapid fire guns in which the speed of firing is such that it is practically continuous.", "The best known make is the famous Gatling gun invented by Dr.", "R. J. Gatling of Indianapolis in 1860.", "This gun consists of ten parallel barrels grouped around and secured firmly to a main central shaft to which is also attached the grooved cartridge carrier and the lock cylinder.", "Each barrel is provided with its own lock or firing mechanism, independent of the other, but all of them revolve simultaneously with the barrels, carrier and inner breech when the gun is in operation.", "In firing, one end of the feed case containing the cartridges is placed in the hopper on top and the operating crank is turned.", "The cartridges drop one by one into the grooves of the carrier and are loaded and fired by the forward motion of the locks, which also closes the breech while the backward motion extracts and expels the empty shells.", "In its present state of efficiency the Gatling gun fires at the rate of 1,200 shots per minute, a speed, by separate discharges, not equaled by any other gun.", "Much larger guns were constructed in times past than are being built now.", "In 1880 the English made guns weighing from 100 to 120 tons, from 18 to 20 inches bore and which fired projectiles weighing over 2,000 pounds at a velocity of almost 1,700 feet per second.", "At the same time the United States fashioned a monster rifle of 127 tons which had a bore of sixteen inches and fired a projectile of 2,400 pounds with a velocity of 2,300 feet per second.", "The largest guns ever placed on board ship were the Armstrong one  hundred and ten ton guns of the English battleships, _Sanspareil_, _Benbow_ and _Victoria_.", "They were sixteen and one fourth inch calibre.", "The newest battleships of England, the _Dreadnought_ and the _Temeraire_, are equipped with fourteen inch guns, but they are not one  half so heavy as the old guns.", "Many experts in naval ordnance think it a mistake to have guns over twelve inch bore, basing their belief on the experience of the past which showed that guns of a less calibre carrying smaller shells did more effective work than the big bore guns with larger projectiles.", "The two titanic war vessels now in course of construction for the United States Navy will each carry a battery of ten fourteen inch rifles, which will be the most powerful weapons ever constructed and will greatly exceed in range and hitting power the twelve inch guns of the _Delaware_ or _North Dakota_.", "Each of the new rifles will weigh over sixty three tons, the projectiles will each weigh 1,400 pounds and the powder charge will be 450 pounds.", "At the moment of discharge each of these guns will exert a muzzle energy of 65,600 foot tons, which simply means that the energy will be so great that it could raise 65,600 tons a foot from the ground.", "The fourteen hundred pound projectiles shall be propelled through the air at the rate of half a mile a second.", "It will be plainly seen that the metal of the guns must be of enormous resistance to withstand such a force.", "The designers have taken this into full consideration and will see to it that the powder chamber in which the explosion takes place as well as the breech lock on which the shock is exerted is of steel so wrought and tempered as to withstand the terrific strain.", "At the moment of detonation the shock will be about equal to that of a heavy engine and a train of Pullman coaches running at seventy miles an hour, smashing into a stone wall.", "On leaving the muzzle of the gun the shell will have an energy equivalent to that of a train of cars weighing 580 tons and running at sixty miles an hour.", "Such energy will be sufficient to send the projectile through twenty two and a half inches of the hardest of steel armour at the muzzle, while at a range of 3,000 yards, the projectile moving at the rate of 2,235 feet per second will pierce eighteen and a half inches of steel armor at normal impact.", "The velocity of the projectile leaving the gun will be 2,600 feet per second, a speed which if maintained would carry it around the world in less than fifteen hours.", "Each of the mammoth guns will be a trifle over fifty three feet in length and the estimated cost of each will be $85,000.", "Judging from the

brought into action at one time and maintain the three shot rapidity for one hour, the cost of the ammunition expended in that hour would reach the enormous sum of $2,520,000.", "Very few, however, of the big guns are called upon for the three shots a minute rate, for the metal would not stand the heating strain.", "The big guns are expensive and even when only moderately used their \"life\" is short, therefore, care is taken not to put them to too great a strain.", "With the smaller guns it is different.", "Some of six inch bore fire as high as eight aimed shots a minute, but this is only under ideal conditions.", "Great care is being taken now to prolong the \"life\" of the big guns by using non corrosive material for the charges.", "The United States has adopted a pure gun cotton smokeless powder in which the temperature of combustion is not only lower than that of nitro glycerine, but even lower than that of ordinary gunpowder.", "With the use of this there has been a very material decrease in the corrosion of the big guns.", "The former smokeless powder, containing a large percentage of nitro glycerine such as \"cordite,\" produced such an effect that the guns were used up and practically worthless, after firing fifty to sixty rounds.", "Now it is possible for a gun to be as good after two or even three hundred rounds as at the beginning, but certainly not if a three minute rate is maintained.", "At such a rate the \"life\" of the best gun made would be short indeed.", "CHAPTER XV  MYSTERY OF THE STARS  Wonders of the Universe  Star Photography  The Infinity

grand machinery of Nature.", "If our entire solar system were wiped out of being, there would be left no noticeable void among the countless systems of worlds and suns and stars; in the immensity of space the sun with all his revolving planets is not even as a drop to the ocean or a grain of sand to the composition of the earth.", "There are millions of other suns of larger dimensions with larger attendants wheeling around them in the illimitable fields of space.", "Those stars which we erroneously call \"fixed\" stars are the centers of other systems vastly greater, vastly grander than the one of which our earth forms so insignificant a part.", "Of course to us numbers of them appear, even when viewed through the most powerful telescopes, only as mere luminous points, but that is owing to the immensity of distance between them and ourselves.", "But the number that is visible to us even with instrumental assistance can have no comparison with the number that we cannot see; there is no limit to that number; away in what to us may be called the background of space are millions, billions, uncountable myriads of invisible suns regulating and illuminating countless systems of invisible worlds.", "And beyond those invisible suns and worlds is a region which thought cannot measure and numbers cannot span.", "The finite mind of man becomes dazed, dumbfounded in contemplation of magnitude so great and distance so amazing.", "We stand not bewildered but lost before the problem of interstellar space.", "Its length, breadth, height and circumference are illimitable, boundless; the great eternal cosmos without beginning and without end.", "In order to get some idea of the vastness of interstellar space we may consider a few distances within the limits of human conception.", "We know that light travels at the rate of 186,000 miles a second, yet it requires light over four years to reach us from the nearest of the fixed stars, travelling at this almost inconceivable rate, and so far away are some that their light travelling at the same rate from the dawn of creation has never reached us yet or never will until our little globule of matter disintegrates and its particles, its molecules and corpuscles, float away in the boundless ether to amalgamate with the matter of other flying worlds and suns and stars.", "The nearest to us of all the stars is that known as _Alpha Centauri_.", "Its distance is computed at 25,000,000,000,000 miles, which in our notation reads twenty five trillion miles.", "It takes light over four years to traverse this distance.", "It would take the \"Empire State Express,\" never stopping night or day and going at the rate of a mile a minute, almost 50,000,000 years to travel from the earth to this star.", "The next of the fixed stars and the brightest in all the heavens is that which we call _Sirius_ or the Dog Star.", "It is double the distance of Alpha Centauri, that is, it is eight \"light years\" away.", "The distances of about seventy other stars have been ascertained ranging up to seventy or eighty \"light years\" away, but of the others visible to the naked eye they are too far distant to come within the range of trigonometrical calculation.", "They are out of reach of the mathematical eye in the depth of space.", "But we know for certain that the distance of none of these visible stars, without a measurable parallax, is less than four million times the distance of our sun from the earth.", "It would be useless to express this in figures as it would be altogether incomprehensible.", "What then can be said of the telescopic stars, not to speak at all of those beyond the power of instruments to determine.", "If a railroad could be constructed to the nearest star

in the world amounts to but $4,000,000,000 (four billion dollars), equal to a gold cube of 24 feet.", "Therefore it would take sixty times the world's stock of gold to pay the fare of one passenger, at a cent a mile from the earth to Alpha Centauri.", "The light from numbers, probably countless numbers, of stars is so long in coming to us that they could be blotted out of existence and we would remain unconscious of the fact for years, for hundreds of years, for thousands of years, nay to infinity.", "Thus if _Sirius_ were to collide with some other space traveler and be knocked into smithereens as an Irishman would say, we would not know about it for eight years.", "In fact if all the stars were blotted out and only the sun left we should still behold their light in the heavens and be unconscious of the extinction of even some of the naked eye stars for sixty or seventy years.", "It is vain to pursue farther the unthinkable vastness of the visible Universe; as for the invisible it is equally useless for even imagination to try to grapple with its never ending immensity, to endeavor to penetrate its awful clouded mystery forever veiled from human view.", "In all there are about 3,000 stars visible to the naked eye in each hemisphere.", "A three inch pocket telescope brings about one million into view.", "The grand and scientifically perfected instruments of

be long before every star photographically visible to the most powerful telescope will have its present position accurately defined on these photographic charts.", "When, the sensitized plate is exposed for a considerable time even invisible stars photograph themselves, and in this way a great number of stars have been discovered which no telescope, however powerful, can bring within the

be allowed to enter, survey all the fields of space and set a limit to their boundaries.", "Although the riddle of the universe still remains unsolved because unsolvable, no one can deny that Astronomy has made mighty strides forward during the past few years.", "What has been termed the \"Old Astronomy,\" which concerns itself with the determination of the positions and motions of the heavenly bodies, has been rejuvenated and an immense amount of work has been accomplished by concerted effort, as well as by individual exertions.", "The greatest achievements have been the accurate determination of the positions of the fixed stars visible to the eye.", "Their situation is now estimated with as unerring precision as is that of the planets of our own system.", "Millions upon millions of stars have been photographed and these photographs will be invaluable in determining the future changes and motions of these giant suns of interstellar space.", "Of our own system we now know definitely the laws governing it.", "Fifty years ago much of our solar machinery was misunderstood and many things were enveloped in mystery which since has been made very plain.", "The spectroscope has had a wonderful part in astronomical research.", "It first revealed the nature of the gases existing in the sun.", "It next enabled us to study the prominences on any clear day.", "Then by using it in the spectro heliograph we have been enabled to photograph the entire visible surface of the sun, together with the prominences at one time.", "Through the spectro heliograph we know much more about what the central body of our system is doing than our theories can explain.", "Fresh observations are continually bringing to light new facts which must soon be accounted for by laws at present unknown.", "Spectroscopic observations are by no means confined to the sun.", "By them we now study the composition of the atmospheres of the other planets; through them the presence of chemical elements known on the earth is detected in vagrant comets, far distant stars and dimly shining nebulae.", "The spectroscope also makes it possible to measure the velocities of objects which are approaching or receding from us.", "For instance we know positively that the bright star called Aldebaran near the constellation of the Pleiades is retreating from us at a rate of almost two thousand miles a minute.", "The greatest telescopes in the world are now being trained on stars that are rushing away towards the \"furthermost\" of space and in this way astronomers are trying to get definite knowledge as to the actual velocity with which the celestial bodies are speeding.", "It is only within the past few years that photography has been applied to astronomical development.", "In this connection, more accurate results are obtained by measuring the photographs of stellar spectra than by measuring the spectra themselves.", "Photography with modern rapid plates gives us, with a given telescope, pictures of objects so faint that no visual telescope of the same size will reveal them.", "It is in this way that many of the invisible stars have impressed themselves upon exposed plates and given us a vague idea of the immensity in number of those stars which we cannot view with eye or instrument.", "Though we have made great advancement, there are many problems yet even in regard to our own little system of sun worlds which clamor loudly for solution.", "The sun himself represents a crowd of pending problems.", "His peculiar mode of rotation; the level of sunspots; the constitution of the photospheric cloud shell, its relation to faculae which rise from it, and to the surmounting vaporous strata; the nature of the prominences; the alternations of coronal types; the affinities of the zodiacal light  all await investigation.", "A great telescope has recently shown that one star in eighteen on the average is a visual double  is composed of two suns in slow revolution around their common center of mass.", "The spectroscope using the photographic plate, has established within the last decade that one star in every five or six on the average is attended by a companion so near to it as to remain invisible in the most powerful telescopes, and so massive as to swing the visible star around in an elliptic orbit.", "The photography of comets, nebulae and solar coronas has made the study of these phenomena incomparably more effective than the old visual methods.", "There is no longer any necessity to make \"drawings\" of them.", "The old dread of comets has been relegated into the shade of ignorance.", "The long switching tails regarded so ominously and from which were anticipated such dire calamities as the destruction of worlds into chaos

1910, and we hadn't even a pyrotechnical display of fire rockets to celebrate the occasion.", "In fact there was not a single celestial indication of the passage and we would not have known only for the calculations of the astronomer.", "The passing of a comet now, as far as fear is concerned, means no more, in fact not as much, as the passing of an automobile.", "Science no doubt has made wonderful strides in our time, but far as it has gone, it has but opened for us the first few pages of the book of the heavens  the last pages of which no man shall ever read.", "For aeons upon aeons of time, worlds and suns, and systems of worlds and suns, revolved through the infinity of space, before man made his appearance on the tiny molecule of matter we call the earth, and for aeons upon aeons, for eternity upon eternity, worlds and suns shall continue to roll and revolve after the last vestige of man shall have disappeared, nay after the atoms of earth and sun and all his attending

life, whereas elsewhere, such conditions do not prevail, and that on no other sphere can such physical habitudes be found as will enable life to originate or to exist.", "It can be easily shown that such reasoning is based on untenable foundations.", "Other worlds have to go through processes of evolution, and there can be no doubt that many are in a state similar to our own.", "It required hundreds of thousands, perhaps hundreds of millions of years, before this earth was fit to sustain human life.", "The same transitions which took place on earth are taking place in other planets of

exists on Mars must be much thinner than ours and far too rare to sustain the life of a people with our limited lung capacity.", "A race with immense chests could live under such conditions, and folk

Mars by means of the telescope the object would need to have dimensions one hundred and fifty times as great as the object on the moon; in other words, before we could see a building on Mars, it would have to be one hundred and fifty times the size of the Metropolitan Building.", "Even if there are inhabitants there, it is not likely they have such large buildings.", "Assuming that there _are_ Martians, and that they are desirous of communicating with the earth by waving a flag, such a flag in order to be seen through the most powerful telescopes and when Mars is nearest, would have to be 300 miles long and 200 miles wide and be flung from a flagpole 500 miles high.", "The consideration of such a signal only belongs to the domain of the imagination.", "As an illustration, it should conclusively settle the question of the possibility or rather impossibility of signalling between the two planets.", "Let us suppose that the signalling power of wireless telegraphy had been advanced to such perfection that it was possible to transmit a signal across a distance of 8,000 miles, equal to the diameter of the earth, or 1 30 the distance to the moon.", "Now, in order to be appreciable at the moon it would require the intensity of the 8,000 mile ether waves to be raised not merely 30 times, but 30 times 30, for to use the ordinary expression, the intensity of an effect spreading in all directions like the ether waves, decreases inversely as the square of the distance.", "If the whole earth were brought within the domain of wireless telegraphy, the system would still have to be improved 900 times as much again before the moon could be brought within the sphere of its influence.", "A wireless telegraphic signal, transmitted across a distance equal to the diameter of the earth, would be reduced to a mere sixteen millionth part if it had to travel over the distance to Mars; in other words, if wireless telegraphy attained the utmost excellence now hoped for it  that is, of being able to girdle the earth  it would have to be increased a thousandfold and then a thousandfold again, and finally multiplied by 16, before an appreciable _signal_ could be transmitted to Mars.", "This seems like drawing the long bow, but it is a scientific truth.", "There is no doubt that ether waves can and do traverse the distance between the Earth and Mars, for the fact that sunlight reaches Mars and is reflected back to us proves this; but the source of waves adequate to accomplish such a feat must be on such a scale as to be hopelessly beyond the power of man to initiate or control.", "Electrical signalling to Mars is much more out of the question than wireless.", "Even though electrical phenomena produced in any one place were sufficiently intense to be appreciable by suitable instruments all over the earth, that intensity would have to be enhanced another sixteen million fold before they would be appreciable on the planet Mars.", "It is absolutely hopeless to try to span the bridge that lies between us and Mars by any methods known to present day science.", "Yet men styling themselves scientists say it can be done and will be done.", "This is a prophecy, however, which must lie in the future.", "As has been pointed out, we have as yet but scratched the outer surface in the fields of knowledge.", "What visions may not be opened to the eyes of men, as they go down deeper and deeper into the soil.", "Secrets will be exhumed undreamt of now, mysteries will be laid bare to the light of day, and perhaps the psychic riddle of life itself may be solved.", "Then indeed, Mars may come to be looked on as a next door neighbor, with whose life and actions we are as well acquainted as with our own.", "The thirty five million miles that separate him from us may be regarded as a mere step in space and the most distant planets of our system as but a little journey afield.", "Distant Uranus may be looked upon as no farther away than is, say, Australia from America at the present time.", "It is vain, however, to indulge in these premises.", "The veil of mystery still hangs between us and suns and stars and systems.", "One fact lies before us of which there is no uncertainty  _we die_ and pass away from our present state into some other.", "We are not annihilated into nothingness.", "Suns and worlds also die, after performing their allotted revolutions in the cycle of the universe.", "Suns glow for a time, and planets bear their fruitage of plants and animals and men, then turn for aeons into a dreary, icy listlessness and finally crumble to dust, their atoms joining other worlds in the indestructibility of matter.", "After all, there really is no death, simply change  change from one state to another.", "When we say we die, we simply mean that we change our state.", "There is a life beyond the grave.", "As Longfellow beautifully expresses it       \"Life is real, life is earnest,     And the grave is not its goal,     Dust thou art, to dust returnest,     Was not spoken of the soul.\"", "But whither do we go when we pass on?", "Where is the soul when it leaves the earthly tenement called the body?", "We, Christians, in the light of revelation and of faith, believe in a heaven for the good; but it is not a material place, only a state of being.", "Where and under what conditions is that state?", "This leads us to the consideration of another question which is engrossing the minds of many thinkers and reasoners of the present day.", "Can we communicate with the Spirit world?", "Despite the tenets and beliefs and experiences of learned and sincere investigators, we are constrained, thus far, to answer in the negative.", "Yet, though we cannot communicate with it, we know there is a spirit world; the inner consciousness of our being apprises us of that fact, we know our loved ones who have passed on are not dead but gone before, just a little space, and that soon we shall follow them into a higher existence.", "As Talmage said, the tombstone is not the terminus, but the starting post, the door to the higher life, the entrance to the state of endless labor, grand possibilities, and eternal progression.", "This volume is a collection of some of the papers which I have contributed to the _Daily Telegraph_ during the years 1908 1909, under the title Science from an Easy Chair.

The men who have expelled yellow fever from Cuba and Panama have not merely done a piece of sanitary cleaning up; they have first imagined and then created, by the force of human will, directed and maintained by conviction of the reality of science, a new thing—the tropics without deadly fever, the tropics as a healthy and welcome home for the white man.", "That is comparable to the work of a great artist in the directness of its appeal; it is in its actual detail the result of the combination of the skill of the engineer with the foresight and absolute domination of his human agents of a military genius.", "For this magnificent work the highest credit is due to the United States chief sanitary officer, Colonel Gorgas.", "It is well known how the American Medical Commission in Cuba proved six years ago that yellow fever is conveyed from man to man solely and entirely by a gnat common in Central America, known as _Stegomyia_, and further, how by carrying out measures for preventing the entrance of these gnats into dwelling houses, and especially by keeping them away from yellow fever patients so that they fail to obtain and carry the yellow fever germ, even if they do bite healthy men, Colonel Gorgas and his associates practically eradicated yellow fever in Cuba.", "The bite of the _Stegomyia gnat_ is the only way in which a man can acquire yellow fever, and the gnat which bites him must have taken up the germs of yellow fever from another man—twelve days (no less) previously.", "The application of this knowledge and the methods devised to give it effect is what has now rendered the construction of the Panama Canal by the United States Government possible.", "The French Canal Company employed an army of labourers, numbering from 15,000 to 18,000 men.", "They lost, almost entirely by death from yellow fever and malaria, so many of their workmen that others refused to undertake the deadly job, and there was a general panic.", "The death rate was in 1884 over 60 per 1000.", "In 1885 it was over 70 per 1000.", "The work was abandoned.", "In May 1904 Colonel Gorgas and his forces took possession of the canal zone.", "This is a zone of territory running fifty miles north and south, with a good sized town—Colon—at one end of it and another—Panama—at the other end of it.", "Many hundreds of men were at once organised and set to work to destroy in both the towns the _Stegomyia gnat_.", "This was effected by doing away with all the breeding places of the gnat, that is, screening and covering every water receptacle in the town, so that the gnats or mosquitoes cannot breed.", "Then a fumigating process was carried out in all houses and buildings, great and small, to destroy such gnats as were still alive.", "No less than 200,000 lb.", "of pyrethrum and 400,000 lb.", "of sulphur were used in this fumigation.", "In December 1905 the last case of yellow fever occurred.", "It took sixteen months of the work just described to effect this.", "In a different way the _Anopheles gnat_ or mosquito, which carries the germ of malaria from man to man, was got rid of.", "This gnat breeds in clean water, where grass and weeds grow;

Mr.", "Balfour’s speech did not imply any disregard for the pursuit of historical knowledge and a training in literature and the use of language, but it was a clear recognition of the fact that when the great purpose for which universities exist is considered it must be asserted in no hesitating terms that the discovery of new knowledge is the most important activity which a university can foster.", "To train men (and women, too) to use their faculties not merely to acquire knowledge of what has been discovered by others in the past, but to discover new things and to gain further control over the conditions in which we live, and to secure further understanding not only of nature but of man—that is the great business of the university.", "It was fortunate that Mr.", "Balfour was present and able to strike this note, for Lord Morley, the new Chancellor, had not expressed any such conception of the aims of a university.", "He declared that, so long as the Greeks have anything to teach us we should not cease to study the Greeks.", "But, whilst we may agree to this, it is well to remember that, though pleasure can still be obtained from Greek poetry and prose by those who have thoroughly mastered the Greek language, yet almost all, if not quite all, that the Greeks have to teach us has been by this time translated and dealt with by our own writers.", "Consequently, although we may cordially approve of the study of ancient civilisations and ancient literatures and languages, both Greek and barbarian, as part of the enterprise of a university, it is somewhat excessive, not to say belated, to set up the study of Greek or of any other historic language and civilisation as the chief and distinctive boon which universities can offer to their scholars.", "The matter has, indeed, been thrashed out, and Greek, together with what is called the study of literature (but is usually an ineffective dabbling in it), has been put into its proper subordinate place in all the universities of Europe and in most of those of Great Britain.", "The illusion that flowers of speech and mastery of phrase (though all very well if honestly used) are an indication of any knowledge or capacity which can be of service to the community, has been, in late years, to a very large extent, dispelled.", "The concluding words of Mr.", "Balfour’s speech were  The great advancement of mankind is to be looked for in our ever increasing knowledge of the secrets of nature—secrets, however, which are not to be unlocked by the men who pursue them for purely material ends, but secrets which are open in their fulness only to men who pursue them in a disinterested spirit.", "The motive power which is really going to change the external surface of civilisation, which is going to add to the well being of mankind, which is going to stimulate the imagination of all those who are interested in the universe in which our lot is cast—that lies after all with science.", "I would rather be known as having added to the sum of our knowledge of the truth of nature than anything else I can imagine.", "Unfortunately for me, my opportunities have lain in different directions.  That is a splendid confession of faith.", "I do not remember that any German statesman of like authority and standing has ever given expression to so full and ample a belief in the value of science.", "Yet German statesmen have acted, though they have not spoken.", "They have arranged for, and continually are arranging for, a far larger expenditure of public money upon scientific training and investigation than is assigned to such purposes in this country.", "Every department of government in Germany has its thoroughly trained, well taught, well paid body of scientific experts and investigators, and, moreover, the whole official world, from the Emperor downwards, has a real understanding of what science is, of the folly of attempting to proceed without it, or allowing persons who are ignorant of it to act as administrators.", "The need for science is not merely recognised in words, but steps are taken, and have been taken now for many years, actually to secure in German public offices and public administration the predominance of that scientific knowledge which the German statesmen, as well as Mr.", "Balfour, consider so necessary.", "Is it too much to hope that in this country those who recognise the value and importance of scientific knowledge will also take steps to re arrange our Government departments so as to give them the advantage of guidance by men trained in the knowledge of nature, rather than by men ignorant of the very existence of such knowledge?", "The universities hold the central position in this matter, and it is their influence and wealth which the State should insist on directing towards the extension and diffusion of science.", "Those who address the public on this subject not infrequently take what seems to me to be a disastrous line at the start.", "They speak of the new universities as the universities of the people, and hand over Oxford and Cambridge, with their enormous endowments, their history and tradition, to the wealthy class.", "Such usurpation cannot be tolerated.", "It is monstrous that the endowments of the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, which were thoroughly popular and democratic in their foundation, should be, even for a moment, regarded as the peculiar property of the wealthy.", "It is also monstrous to suppose that it is anything less than disastrous to consign the well to do classes in any community to an empty sham of ancient culture rather than to imbue them with the real and inspiring culture of the modern renaissance.", "It is because this notion is allowed to gain ground that the enormous funds of the colleges and universities of Oxford and Cambridge, amounting to more than three quarters of a million pounds annually, are to a large extent, though not exclusively, employed in keeping up a couple of huge boarding schools, which are shut for six months in the year.", "It is owing to this that it is the rarest thing to find in Oxford or in Cambridge a great teacher who lectures or demonstrates to an eager following of disciples.", "An overwhelming majority of the young men who go as students to these universities have no intention of studying anything.", "They are sent there in order to be submitted to college discipline and to have, subject to that safeguard, a good time.", "A large number are handsomely paid by scholarships in order to induce them to go there—and would not go there at all unless they were so paid.", "They do not find such teachers there and such an effective occupation of their student years as would induce them, if unpaid, to seek the university, or to pay fees out of their own pockets for the opportunities of seriously pursuing any branch of learning or science within its walls.", "The inefficiency of the old universities is to a large extent the cause of the neglect and ignorance of science in the well to do class, who furnish the men who become Government officials of all kinds and members of professions which influence public opinion.", "But this inefficiency of the old universities is not due to their devotion to literary studies and to abstract science, nor to their objection to the pursuit of practical and commercial studies.", "That excuse is sometimes put forward for them, though at this moment they are, in fact, setting up laboratories and lecture rooms for engineering, agriculture, forestry, mining, and such applications of science.", "Nor is it money which is really wanting at either Oxford or Cambridge, although they are both begging for it from the public.", "What Oxford and Cambridge want is not money but men; men as teachers—professors is the usual title given to them in a university—who must be the ablest, each in his own line, in the whole world.", "If such professors existed in either Oxford or Cambridge, and were allowed to teach, the town (if not the colleges!)", "would be full to overflowing of students—eager to pay their fees and to spend, not three short terms of seven weeks in each year, but the whole year, and many years, in the laboratories and lecture rooms of those commanding men.", "To obtain such men—to set the machinery at work—you must pay them handsomely, and give them authority and the means of work.", "Once they were at work, the mere fees of the students would furnish a splendid revenue.", "There is plenty of money at Oxford and at Cambridge—a superabundance, in fact—which could and should be applied to this purpose, namely, that of securing and establishing there the greatest teachers in the world.", "The money is at present administered by the colleges according to the directions given in recent Acts of Parliament, and by no means in any blind obedience to the original intentions of the founders of the colleges.", "It is to a large extent wasted.", "That portion of it paid out as scholarships is for the most part wasted in bringing students to a place where they cannot get the best opportunities of study, and the rest is unwisely applied (not so much by the tenants for life or administrators of college funds as by rigid Act of Parliament) to providing an excessive number of totally inadequate salaries by which a corresponding number of young men are induced to enter upon the career of teachers as underpaid college Fellows.", "III  DARWIN’S THEORY   On Wednesday, the 1st of July 1908, half a century had passed since Darwin’s Theory of the Origin of Species was made known to the world.", "Fifty years have now been completed since that immortal book, _The Origin of Species_, was published, and a hundred years since Charles Darwin was born.", "It is not every one who is in a position to understand how great and momentous was the occasion when Sir Charles Lyell and Dr.", "Joseph Hooker communicated to the Linnean Society of London, on the 1st of July 1858, two papers, one by Charles Darwin, the other by Alfred Russel Wallace, under the common title, On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties  and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural means of Selection. The reason for this conjoint communication to the Linnean Society was that Darwin, who had been working for years at the subject, and had already, in 1842, drawn up a statement of his theory, not for publication, but for the consideration and criticism of his friend Hooker—unexpectedly received from Alfred Russel Wallace, who was, and had been for some years, away in the Malay Archipelago—a manuscript of an essay on the origin of species, containing views identical with his own, and even phrases similar to those he had himself found it necessary to invent.", "Thus Wallace speaks of the struggle for existence, whilst Darwin had used the term struggle for life. Darwin had been urged by his friends before this to publish an abstract or statement of his conclusions, but now that he had received Wallace’s manuscript, he declared in a letter to Hooker, I would far rather burn my whole book than that he or any other man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit. And so Lyell and Hooker took the matter in hand, and communicated to the Linnean Society, accompanied by an explanatory statement, the two independent papers, setting forth, as they say, the results of the investigations of the indefatigable naturalists, Mr.", "Charles Darwin and Mr.", "Alfred Wallace. Such loyalty and regard to each other as Darwin and Wallace showed then and ever after form a delightful feature in the history of this great discovery.", "A wonderful thing is that Hooker, now Sir Joseph Hooker, the greatest botanist of the past century, the constant friend and comrade of Darwin, is still alive, and that Alfred Russel Wallace, too, is still with us.", "They both were present when the Linnean Society celebrated the meeting of fifty years ago.", "The views of Darwin and Wallace have now become the established doctrine of science.", "They have led to the universal recognition of the origin of species by descent with modification. That is a statement, in other words, to the effect that all the various kinds of living things have been gradually produced by natural birth from predecessors which differ from them only slightly in the later stages of time, but become simpler and less like their descendants as we go further back, until we reach the simplest living things.", "It has led to the conviction that there has been no exceptional or miraculous suspension of the order of Nature in this process, but that all has come about in due and regular course, in virtue of the properties of natural things, which we know as the laws of physics and chemistry.", "Most important and dominating of all these results is the inevitable one that man himself has come from animal ancestors, in the same way, and—(this is the greatest and most far reaching conclusion of all)—that he is still subject to those natural processes of change and development by which he has reached his present phase; that he must completely understand them and control them (so far as such control is possible) in order to maintain a healthy, happy, and improving race of men on the face of the globe.", "This great possession—the earth and all that lives on it—is, as Lord Bacon phrased it three hundred years ago—the Kingdom of Man.", "Man has but to use his intelligence in order to take control of it.", "The knowledge of his own relation to it, and of the ways in which the human race is affected for good and for ill, through the operation of the self same processes which affect the breeding, the improvement, the health, the disease, the destruction, and the perfecting of other living things, has once and for all been placed within man’s reach by the discoveries of Darwin and Wallace.", "Before Darwin—that is, before 1st July 1858—the origin of the different species of animals and plants was called by great thinkers like Sir John Herschel, the astronomer, the mystery of mysteries. The word species was defined as an animal or plant which in a state of nature is distinguished by certain peculiarities of form, size, colour, or other circumstance from any other animal or plant, and propagates after its kind individuals perfectly resembling the parent, its peculiarities being therefore permanent. So wrote a great naturalist in the days before Darwin.", "This definition may be illustrated by two common English birds—the rook and the crow.", "They differ from each other in slight peculiarities of form, structure, and habits, and, moreover, rooks always produce rooks, and crows always produce crows, and they do not interbreed.", "Therefore it was held that all the rooks in the world had descended from a single pair of rooks, and all the crows in like manner from a single pair of crows, while it was considered impossible that crows could have descended from rooks, or rooks from crows.", "The origin of the first pair of each kind was a mystery, and by many persons was held to have been due to a miraculous and sudden act of creation. But besides our crow and rook, there are about thirty other birds in various parts of the world so much like our crow and rook that they are commonly called crows, and are all regarded as species of the genus crow (or _Corvus_).", "It was held before Darwin that all the individuals of each of these species were descended from an ancestral pair of crows of that species.", "There would have been thirty different original kinds, the origin of which was unknown, and by naturalists was regarded as a mystery.", "Now, on the contrary, it is held that all the thirty living species are descended from one, not from thirty, ancestral species, and have been gradually modified to their present character in different parts of the world; and, further, that this ancestral species was itself derived by slow process of change and natural birth from preceding crow like birds no longer existing.", "As Mr.", "Alfred Russel Wallace has said in his most readable and delightful book, _Darwinism_—where he gives all the credit and glory to his great fellow worker  Darwin wrote for a generation which had not accepted evolution—a generation which poured contempt on those who upheld the derivation of species from species by any natural law of descent.", "He did his work so well that ‘descent with modification’ is now universally accepted as the order of nature in the organic world, and the rising generation of naturalists can hardly realise the novelty of this idea, or that their fathers considered it a scientific heresy to be condemned rather than seriously discussed.  For those who are not naturalists or men of science it is an object lesson of the highest importance, that the speculations and observations which have led to the general acceptance of a new view as to the origin of the species of birds, butterflies, and flowers—in itself apparently a matter of no consequence to human life and progress—should have necessarily led to a new epoch in philosophy, and in the higher state craft; in fact, to the establishment of the scientific knowledge of life as the one sure guide and determining factor of civilisation.", "How to breed a healthy, capable race of men, how to preserve such a race, how to educate and to train it, so that its best qualities of mind and body may be brought to activity and perfection—this is what Darwinism can teach us, and will teach us when the great subjects of inheritance and of variation are more fully investigated by the aid of public funds, and when the human mind has been as carefully examined and its laws as well ascertained, as are those of the human body.", "There is no reason for delay; no excuse for it.", "For two thousand years the learned men of Europe debated as to whether this or that place was the site of ancient Troy, or whether there ever was such a place at all.", "At last (only twenty five years ago) a retired man of business, named Schliemann, had a happy thought—it was not the thought of a learned pedant, but of a scientific investigator.", "He said, Let us go and see. And at the expense of a few thousand pounds he went and found Troy and Mycenæ, and revealed—dis covered—the whole matter.", "That was the most tremendous and picturesque triumph of the scientific method over mere talk and pretended historical learning which has ever been seen since human record has existed.", "It ought to be told to every boy and girl, for it is the greatest and most obvious proof of the overwhelming power of the investigation of tangible things and the futility of chatter, which has ever been seen.", "It is enough to inspire hope and belief in experiment even in the breast of a Member of Parliament, or of a Minister of the Crown.", "IV  DARWIN’S DISCOVERIES   A large proportion of the public are not aware of the amount of experiment and observation carried out by the great naturalist whose memory was honoured by a splendid ceremony at the University of Cambridge in the summer of 1909.", "There are, I am sure, not a few who are under the impression that Darwin, sitting in his study or walking round his garden, had a happy thought, namely, that man is only a modified and improved monkey, and proceeded to write an argumentative essay, setting forth the conclusion that mankind are the descendants of some remote ancestral apes.", "Of course there is an increasing number of more careful and inquiring men and women who take advantage of the small price at which Mr.", "Darwin’s wonderful book, _The Origin of Species_, is now to be bought, and have read that and some of his other writings, and accordingly know how far he was from being the hasty and fanciful theorist they previously imagined him to be.", "It is the great distinction of Darwin that he spent more than twenty years of his life in accumulating the records of an enormous series of facts and observations tending to show that the species or kinds of animals and plants in nature can and do change slowly, and that there is, owing to the fact that every pair produces a great number of offspring (sometimes many thousand), of which only a single pair, on the average, survive, a necessary selection of those which are to survive and breed, accompanied by a rejection and destruction of the rest.", "This natural selection or survival of favoured varieties, he was able to show, must operate like the selection made by breeders, fanciers, and horticulturists, and has in all probability (for in a history extending over hundreds of thousands of years we must necessarily deal with probabilities, and not with direct demonstration) produced new forms, new kinds, better adapted to their surroundings than the parental forms from which they are derived.", "It was necessary, in order that Darwin should persuade other naturalists that his views were correct, that he should show by putting examples on the table that variations occur naturally and in great diversity; further, that there is great pressure in the conditions of life, and a consequent survival of the best suited varieties; further, that there is in reproduction a transmission of the peculiar favouring character or quality which enables a variety to survive, and thus a tendency to perpetuate the new quality.", "It was not enough for Darwin to imagine that these things might be so, or to make the notion that they are so plausible by arguments drawn from existing knowledge.", "He had to do that  but also he had to make new inquiries and discover new things about animals and plants which fitted in with his theory and would not fit in either with the notion that all plants and animals were created—as the poet Milton supposed—out of lumps of earth and muddy water, suddenly, in the likeness of their present day descendants, nor with some other notions, such as that of the able and gifted French naturalist Lamarck.", "And he spent the later twenty years of his life in doing so, just as he had spent the previous twenty years in collecting a first series of facts and observations justifying his theory before he announced it to the world.", "A great difference between Lamarck and Darwin exists, not only in their two theories as to the mode of origin of the vast diversified series of kinds or species of plants and animals, but in their way of stating and dealing with the theory which each thought out and gave to the world.", "Lamarck had a great knowledge of the species of plants and animals, partly through having collected specimens himself when he was an officer in the French Republican army which was employed on the Mediterranean shores of France and Italy more than a hundred years ago, and partly through his later official position in the great natural history museum at Paris, where large collections passed through his hands.", "He was a man of very keen insight and excellent method, and did more to plan out a natural and satisfactory classification of animals than any one between his own day and that of Linnæus.", "His theory of the origin of species was essentially an opposition to the then popular view that the species of living things have been made by the Creator so as to fit the conditions in which they live.", "Lamarck contradicted this view, and said in so many words that the real fact is that the peculiar specific characters of animals or of plants have not been created for their conditions, but, on the contrary, that the conditions in which they live have created the peculiarities of living things.", "In so far his conception was the same as Darwin’s.", "But Lamarck then said to himself  How do the conditions create the peculiarities of different living things?", "And he answered this question by an ingenious guess, which he published to the world in a book called _Philosophical Zoology_, without taking any steps to test the truth of his guess.", "That is where Lamarck’s method and attitude as a scientific man is so greatly inferior to that of Darwin.", "Lamarck, sitting in his study, said animals (and plants too) must be affected by the conditions around them, so that an individual as it lives and grows becomes to a certain degree slightly changed by and adapted to those conditions.", "This, he said, we all see in human beings and familiar animals and plants.", "Now, he said, we have only to admit that the changes so acquired are (especially when both parents have been similarly changed) transmitted to the young in the process of generation, and to some degree intensified, in order to recognise that of necessity there is in nature a constant change and progression of living forms, consisting in a more and more elaborate adaptation to the conditions of life, which will be varied and lead to new adaptations as the living things spread over the earth or as geological changes occur.", "He cited the long neck of the giraffe as an example of what he meant.", "In regions where there was frequent and extensive drought, a deer like creature would eat the lower leaves of trees when the grass was dried up and dead.", "It would strain and stretch its neck in reaching after the higher leaves, and the individuals thus straining and stretching would become an inch or two longer in the neck in consequence.", "These individuals would, said Lamarck, transmit their increased length of neck to their offspring, who again would strain and stretch after higher leaves, and get a further increase of neck length, and so it would go on, little by little, over many thousand generations, until the neck stretchers had become well marked and distinguished by their long necks from such of their ancestral stock as survived in other regions where, the grass being good, there was no inducement to straining and stretching the neck.", "Now the great difference between Lamarck and Darwin is that Lamarck was quite content to state the ingenious supposition illustrated by the imaginary history of the giraffe, and to declare that this was the law of Nature and is actually going on every day, without, so to speak, getting out of his chair.", "He never attempted to show by observation or experiment that such a change of form as the stretching of the neck by straining after food could and did occur, or that if it did that it could be transmitted by a parent or couple of parents to their offspring.", "And consequently for many years no one attached much value to Lamarck’s notions on the subject.", "When, fifty years later, Darwin’s very different theory became widely received, based on the demonstrable fact that congenital variations (not stretchings and warpings acquired in the lifetime of a parent, but variations which are inborn, and occur in some but not other individuals living under one and the same set of conditions) are transmitted to offspring, and that those among these variations which are favourable to success in life will enable their possessor to survive and to produce young inheriting those favourable variations—then it occurred to those naturalists who were inclined to believe in Lamarck’s suggestion to inquire into the solid facts in regard to that also, and to see whether his bare statement was true.", "From that day to this, it has never been shown that it is true.", "It is, indeed, to begin with, a rare thing to find instances of either wild animals or wild plants which, growing up in unusual conditions, have their structure altered and adapted so as to be more serviceable in those unusual conditions than their usual structure would be; and in those cases where such adaptive alterations have been produced, every experimenter is agreed in stating that he has found that when (even after several generations in the changed conditions) the young are restored to their original conditions, they simply grow up into the original forms  no permanent change in the stock or race has been effected.", "Every attempt to show by experiment that a new character can be acquired by the stock in this way, and show itself by heredity alone—when the modifying adapting conditions are removed—has completely failed.", "On the other hand, Darwin himself and his followers have made almost endless experiments and observations on plants and animals, establishing facts as to structure and the relation of special kinds of living things to their surroundings which can only be explained on the supposition that Darwin’s theory is true in detail; that is to say, not merely that the kinds of animals and plants have arisen from previous kinds by natural descent—that supposition is much older than either Darwin or Lamarck—but that the method by which the transformation has been brought about is (_a_) the occurrence in every generation of every animal and plant of minute variations in every, or nearly every, part, and (_b_) the continual selection in the severe struggle for existence of those individuals to grow to maturity and reproduce, which happen to present favourable variations, which variations are accordingly transmitted to the next generation, and may be intensified, so far as intensification is of value, in each succeeding generation.", "A book full of observations and reflections about the structure, habits, and mode of occurrence and geography of a great number of plants and animals is Darwin’s _Journal of Researches_, published in 1845, and now republished as _A Naturalist’s Voyage_.", "In order to know very minutely the differences and resemblances between all the kinds or species of one group of living things Darwin studied for eight years the cirrhipedes, the name given to the sea acorns and ships’ barnacles which occur in all parts of the world, some living on rocks, some on the backs of turtles, others on whales, on the feet of birds, on bits of floating wood or of pumice stone, and some on one another!", "They are all hermaphrodites, but Darwin found in several a most singular thing, namely, the existence of minute males, complemental to and parasitic on the hermaphrodites.", "His discovery was doubted and denied, but he had the pleasure of seeing it at last fully confirmed thirty years after his book on cirrhipedes was published.", "Darwin discovered that the presence of the same species of plants and of some few animals on distant mountain summits and in the Arctic region is due to the former extension of ice between these situations during the last glacial period.", "He was, before everything else and by necessity for the examination of his theory, a geologist, and wrote many valuable geological memoirs.", "The history of the origin of the species of living things consists largely in tracing them to extinct creatures, and in showing what were the possible migrations and what the conditions of land and water, temperature and vegetation, in past periods, and in regard to given areas of the globe.", "The book on the _Fertilisation of Orchids_ was the first published by Darwin after the _Origin of Species_.", "In it he showed how the marvellous shapes and colours and mechanisms of the flowers of orchids are adapted to ensure cross fertilisation by insects, and how they can be explained as originating by the natural selection of variations—if the value of cross fertilisation is once recognised.", "The explanation of the reason for the existence of two kinds of primrose flowers—the short styled and the long styled—clearly arrived at by him as being a mechanism to secure cross fertilisation, delighted him in 1862, and led him to discover the same sort of modification in other flowers.", "Then, in 1864, he published his researches on _Climbing Plants_, and later a book on the _Movements of Plants_, in which he discovered the mechanism and the wonderful variety of movements of plants, and showed their value to the plant, and consequent origin, by natural selection.", "He especially loved to discover evidence that plants can do many things which had been thought to be only within the powers of the other section of living things—the animals; and finding during one summer holiday that the beautiful little sun dew moves its red knobbed tentacles so as to entrap minute insects, he discovered the whole history of _Insectivorous Plants_, and showed that there are many plants of various groups which catch insects and digest them in a sort of stomach, as an animal might do.", "Thus the water holding pitchers of the pitcher plants of tropical forests were explained as being food catchers and digesters of great value to the nutrition of the plant, and their gradual formation by variation and natural selection rendered comprehensible.", "His greatest book next to the _Origin_—containing an immense quantity of original notes and observations and valuable information from all kinds of breeders and fanciers—is the _Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication_ (1868).", "The facts recorded are discussed in the light of the great theory, and honest, fair minded consideration is given to those which present difficulties as well as to those which clearly favour it.", "In 1871 came the _Descent of Man_, followed in 1872 by the _Expression of the Emotions in Men and Animals_—in which, again, it was shown that the facts as to the likeness between man and apes can be explained on the theory that natural selection and survival of favourable variations have been at work, and that the facts are hopelessly without meaning or explanation on any other hypothesis.", "His last published book was on _The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms_, in which he not only showed what an important part earthworms play in burying stones and rocks, and in fitting the ground for the growth of plants, but recorded some discoveries as to the senses of worms and as to their treatment of leaves by a digestive fluid exuded from the mouth so as to soften a leaf before swallowing it.", "Every one of Darwin’s books abounds with new facts and new points of view disclosed by the application to first one thing and then another of his vivifying discovery causing theory of natural selection.", "The subsidiary theory of the selection of brilliantly coloured males by females in pairing, as a cause of the brilliant colours and patterns of many birds and insects, is developed in his _Descent of Man_.", "It led him to many important discoveries and observations as to the colouring and ornamentation of animals, and when considered, together with Wallace’s and Bates’s theory of mimicry and of the warning and protective colourings of insects, goes far to explain all the specific colouring of animals and plants as due to natural selection and survival.", "A theory which has produced such prodigious results in the way of explaining all forms, colours, habits, and occurrences of living things—as has that of Charles Darwin—simply holds the field against all comers.", "When Lamarck’s theory has been shown to be consistent with the most elementary facts as to heredity, and further to afford a rational explanation of any group of biological facts, it will be time to consider how far it may be entertained in conjunction with Darwin’s theory—but not until then.", "V  DARWIN’S THEORY UNSHAKEN   It seems ill mannered, if not ill natured, that the year of the centenary of Charles Darwin’s birth should have been chosen by owners of anonymous pens in order to alarm the public mind with the preposterous statement that his celebrated and universally accepted theory of the origin of the species or kinds of plants and animals by natural selection, or the survival of favoured races in the struggle for life, is undermined and discredited.", "Such a statement once coolly made in the public Press is necessarily believed by a large number of uninformed readers, and, like all calumny, is none the less relished by the foolish, and, for the moment, none the less harmful, because it is baseless.", "Those who seek to belittle Darwin’s theory show, whenever they venture to enter into particulars, that they do not know what Darwin’s theory is.", "They confuse it with other theories, and even imagine that some enthusiastic Darwinians who have tried to add a chapter here or there to Darwin’s doctrine, are opponents of the great theory.", "Let me briefly state what that theory is   It rests on three groups of facts—matters of observation, which are not theory or guess work at all—but admitted by every one and demonstrated every day.", "These are—(1) Living things, each in its kind, produce a far larger number of young than can possibly grow up to maturity, since the kind of food and the situation necessary to each kind are limited and already occupied.", "Only one oyster embryo out of every five million produced (the reader may refer to p.", "137 on this subject) grows up through all the successive stages of youth to the adult state.", "The total number of a species of animal or plant on the whole area where it is found does not increase.", "Even in those which produce a small number of young, there is great destruction, and taking all the individuals into consideration, only a single pair of young arrive at maturity to replace their parents.", "There is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally multiplies at so high a rate that, if not destroyed, the progeny of a single pair would soon cover the earth.", "The elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder of known animals; it commences to breed at 30 years of age, dies at 100, and has six young in the interval.", "After 750 years, supposing all the offspring of a single pair fulfilled the rule and were not destroyed in an untimely way, there would be nearly nineteen million elephants alive descended from the first pair.", "There is then no doubt as to the enormous excess in the production of young living things, nor as to their necessary competition with one another of the most severe and inexorable kind; nor again as to the necessary death, in many species, of hundreds and thousands, for every one which survives to maturity and in its turn breeds.", "(2) The second great fact is that among all the young born to a pair of parents, no two are exactly alike, nor are any exactly like their parents; nor are any two taken from all produced by all parents of that species exactly alike.", "They all resemble their parents at the corresponding age, in a general way and even very closely; but the resemblance is far from amounting to identity.", "This is called variation. It is familiar to us all in the case of the organism which we know best, and observe most closely, namely, man.", "It is also a matter of common observation in the case of dogs, cats, horses, and other domesticated animals.", "Many of these variations are exhibited in points of size, proportion, and colour, which are easily noted at once by the eye.", "But variation is really a deep seated thing, and depends on causes which lie below the surface.", "We know that the offspring of men and of animals and of plants, give evidence of variations in what we call constitution, tendency, temperament, aptitude, strength, and that the colour, and even size of this or that part, are really only indications of a deep seated difference in the living chemistry, the forces of nutrition and growth which reside in the living substance.", "The fact that many thousands of a species may be born and only a few survive, means therefore that many thousand varieties, often varieties not readily measured by the eye, are produced in each generation, from which a few individuals are in some way selected for survival.", "(3) The third great fact is that though there is variation, amongst all the offspring in each generation, there is also a continual and definite inheritance by offspring of the qualities and structure of their parents to a degree which altogether preponderates over the variations.", "To put it in another way, we all know that every parental organism transmits to its young not only the qualities and structure of the species, or of the race, or of the family, but also transmits its own peculiarities or variations in which it departed from its parents, and from its brothers and sisters.", "This is best illustrated by our daily experience of human families.", "These facts being admitted, and abundantly illustrated and traced in detail by years of observation and experimental breeding in all kinds of living things by hundreds of careful observers who have published the records of their studies, we come to the step where Darwin makes use of supposition or hypothesis.", "The question is, Does the one which, out of the thousands of slightly different varieties, survives—do so by haphazard?", "or is there a necessarily acting state of things which selects that one special variety for survival? Gardeners and breeders of pigeons, dogs, and cattle deliberately select the variations which they desire, breed from them, and so carry on by inheritance the special variation—whilst they ruthlessly destroy or restrain from breeding the numerous other variations in their stock which they do not desire.", "If, said Darwin, there is any necessarily selective mechanism in Nature which could act as the breeder does, new varieties might be ‘naturally’ selected, and changes of form and appearance naturally established, which in the course of long ages would amount to such marked differences as separate what we call one species from another. He showed that there is a natural mechanism of the required kind.", "Since, he says, the competition among the members of any one kind or species for a place in life is so very severe, and the hostile circumstances so varied, and since all the competing offspring differ by ‘variation’ ever so little from one another, those varieties which are better suited in even the smallest degree to hold their own not merely in fighting with the others, but in withstanding injurious influences, in escaping enemies, and in procuring food, will be the ones which will survive, when a large number of cases, many thousands, extending over a large area and many years, are considered.", "Those which are ‘best fitted’ to get through the exceedingly numerous dangers and difficulties of life will be the survivors. Hence we get the survival of the fit—the fit variations—by natural selection in the struggle for life.", "This, it will be observed, is an inference, and not a direct observation.", "So long as the conditions remain practically or effectively unchanged, the animal or plant already fitted to them will be succeeded by those of its offspring which most resemble it in the essential points of fitness. But we know that in the course of ages, more or less rapidly, climates change, land emerges from the sea, islands join continents, continents become scattered islands, animals and plants migrate into regions previously uninhabited by them.", "As such changes gradually come on, the natural selection of favoured varieties will necessarily lead to the survival of others than those previously favoured, other variations better suited to the new conditions will survive.", "The natural selection of favoured variations would not amount to much, were the variations not perpetuated by transmission to the young which they produce.", "This, it is common knowledge [see (3)], does take place.", "It is known also that a variation so established is as a result of the regular process of variation presented in larger volume or emphasised in character in some individuals of subsequent generations, and by continued natural selection it may become more and more a prominent or dominant feature of the race.", "So far, the only assumption made by Mr.", "Darwin is that any or some of the endless variations which occur in all the offspring of wild plants and animals, in various combinations and degree in each individual, can be sufficiently important to determine the survival or non survival of the organisms possessing them.", "That is a matter which has been largely studied and discussed.", "The verdict of those who have studied on the spot (as Darwin himself did) the teeming life of the tropics, the insects, birds, and plants of those regions, is that we are justified in considering that small variations are sufficiently important to turn the scale in favour of survival or non survival.", "It is not easy for a man who is not a determined naturalist, constantly observing the ways of wild living things, to appreciate the evidence as to the efficacy of small variations, even were I able here to submit it to him.", "It is to be found in the published works of an army of investigators.", "In any case it is granted that effective variations—whether small or great—occur in nature, and that natural selection favours and perpetuates the new and fitter variety to the exclusion of the less fit.", "The real difficulty to most people comes in the supposition next made by Mr.", "Darwin—namely, that this slow process of change by natural selection of favoured variations and their transmission and perpetuation by inheritance is sufficient to effect by its continued operation through enormous ages of time the conversion of a race of ancestral three toed zebras into the one toed horse of to day; before that, of five toed beasts into three toed; at an earlier stage of fishlike creatures into four footed land animals, and so on.", "You have to picture the whole series of animals and of plants which are now or ever have been, as two gigantic family trees or pedigrees, meeting in common ancestors of the simplest grade of microscopic life.", "All the diverging branches and twigs of these great family trees have been determined by the adaptation of living form to the endlessly varied conditions of life on this planet, by the natural selection or survival of variations and the transmission and accumulation of those variations from parent to offspring.", "This is a tremendous demand on the imagination.", "It is, however, not a difficult one to concede, when one is acquainted with the facts and conclusions of geology.", "The history of the crust of the earth was explained twenty years before the date of Darwin’s theory by Charles Lyell as due to the continued action through immense periods of time of the same natural forces which are now at work.", "And, moreover, the examination of the successive stratified deposits of the earth’s crust has yielded the remains of whole series of animals and of plants (simpler in character the older and deeper the rock in which they occur), which can be satisfactorily explained and interpreted as the ancestral forms from which present organisms have been developed.", "The theory of the natural selection of variations as the moving spring in the gradual development of living forms from simplest living matter is Darwin’s theory.", "It is not possible to find any naturalist of consideration who does not accept it.", "There are various views held and discussed as to the cause of variation, as to the importance of small and of big variations, as to the non transmissibility of some kinds of variation, and as to various peculiarities in regard to inheritance.", "They do not for the most part touch the main features of Mr.", "Darwin’s theory.", "No doubt we are learning and shall learn more about the facts of variation and the details of the process of hereditary transmission, but such increase of knowledge has not tended to undermine Mr.", "Darwin’s theory, and does not seem at all likely to do so.", "On the occasion of the celebration at Cambridge in 1909 of the centenary of Darwin’s birth, I was invited by the Vice Chancellor, on behalf of the University, to deliver in the Senate house an address, others being given by representatives of the United States (Prof.", "Osborne), of Germany (Prof.", "Hertwig), and of Russia (Prof.", "Metchnikoff).", "The following is the text of that address —  I feel it a great honour to be called upon to speak here to day, and to stand, on behalf of the naturalists of the British Empire, by the side of the distinguished men whose orations you have just heard.", "I think that the one thing about Charles Darwin which the large majority of British naturalists would wish to be to day proclaimed, in the first place—with no doubtful or qualifying phrase—is that, in their judgment, after these fifty years of examination and testing, his ‘theory of the origin of species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life’ remains whole and sound and convincing, in spite of every attempt to upset it.", "I am not stating more than the simple truth when I say that, in the judgment of those who are best acquainted with living things in their actual living surroundings, ‘natural selection’ retains the position which Mr.", "Darwin claimed for it of being the main means of the modification of organic forms.", "Our admiration for the vast series of beautiful observations and interesting inquiries carried out by Darwin during his long life must not lead us to forget that they were devised by him in order to test the truth of his theory and to meet objections to it, and that they were triumphantly successful.", "They, together with the work of Alfred Russel Wallace and many of their followers, have more and more firmly established Darwin’s theory.", "On the other hand, no attempt to amend that theory in any essential particular has been successful.", "The nature of organic variation and of the character of the variations upon which natural selection can and does act was not, as we are sometimes asked to believe, neglected or misapprehended by Darwin.", "The notion that these variations are large and sudden was considered by him, and for reasons set forth by him at considerable length rejected.", "That notion has in recent years been resuscitated, but its truth has not been rendered probable by evidence either of such an accurate character or of such pertinence as would justify the rejection of Darwin’s fundamental conception of the importance of minute and ubiquitous variations.", "Further, in regard to the important facts of heredity connected with the cross breeding of cultivated varieties, especially in regard to the blending or non blending of their characters in their offspring and as to prepotency, it seems to me important that we should now and here call to mind the full and careful consideration given to this subject by Darwin.", "We cannot doubt that he would have been deeply interested in the numerical and statistical results associated with the name of Mendel.", "Those results tend to throw light on the mechanisms concerned in hereditary transmission, but it cannot be shown that they are opposed in any way to the truth of Darwin’s great theoretical structure—his doctrine of the origin of species.", "It has often been urged against Darwin that he did not explain the origin of variation, and especially that he has not shown how variations of sufficient moment to be selected for preservation in the struggle for existence have in the first place originated.", "The brief reply to the first objection is that variation is a common attribute of many natural substances of which living matter is only one.", "In regard to the second point, I desire to remind this assembly that Darwin described with special emphasis instances of what he calls ‘correlated variability.’ In my opinion he has thus furnished the key to the explanation of what are called useless specific characters and of incipient organs.", "That key consists in the fact that a general physiological property or character of utility is often selected and perpetuated, which carries with it distinct, even remote, correlated growths and peculiarities obvious to our eyes, yet having no functional value.", "At a later stage in the history of such a form these correlated growths may acquire value and become the subject of selection.", "It is thus, as it seems to me, and as, I believe, to the great body of my brother naturalists, that Darwin’s theory stands after fifty years of trial and application.", "The greatness of Charles Darwin’s work is, and will be for ever, one of the glories of the University of Cambridge.", "It is fitting on the present occasion that one who speaks on behalf of English men of science should call to mind the nature of his connection with this great University and the peculiarly English features of his life story and of that fine character which endears his memory to all of us as much as his genius excites our admiration and reverence.", "Darwin was not, like so many a distinguished son of Cambridge, a scholar or a fellow of his college, nor a professor of the University.", "His connection with the University and the influence which it had upon his life belong to a tradition and a system which have survived longer in our old English universities than in those of other lands.", "Darwin entered the University, not seeking a special course of study with the view of professional training, nor aiming at success in competitive examinations for honours and emolument.", "He came to Cambridge intending to become a clergyman, but blessed with sufficient means and leisure to enable him to pursue his own devices, to collect beetles, to explore the fen country, and to cultivate his love of nature.", "It was thus that he became acquainted with that rare spirit Henslow, the Cambridge professor of botany, and it is through Henslow and the influence of his splendid abilities and high personal character upon Darwin that Cambridge acquired the right to claim the author of the ‘Origin of Species’ as a product of her beneficence and activity as a seat of learning.", "As an Oxford man and a member of Exeter College, I may remind this assembly that in precisely the same way Darwin’s dearest friend and elder brother in science, Charles Lyell, had a few years earlier entered at Exeter College, and by happy chance fallen under the influence of the enthusiastic Buckland, the University reader in geology and a Canon of Christ Church.", "The wise freedom of study permitted and provided for in those long passed days by Oxford and Cambridge is what has given the right to claim the discovery, if not the making, of Lyell to the one and of Darwin to the other.", "Darwin’s love of living nature and of the country life are especially English characteristics; so, too, I venture to think, are the unflinching determination and simple courage—I may even say the audacity—with which he acquired, after he had left the University, the wide range of detailed knowledge in various branches of science which he found necessary in order to deal with the problem of the origin of the species of plants and animals, the investigation of which became his passion.", "The unselfish generosity and delicacy of feeling which marked Darwin’s relations with a younger naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, are known to all.", "I cannot let this occasion pass without citing those words of his which tell us most clearly what manner of man he was and add to his splendid achievements as an intellectual force—a light and a beauty of which every Englishman must be proud.", "When in old age he surveyed his life’s work he wrote —‘I believe that I have acted rightly in steadily following and devoting my life to science.’  To have desired to act ‘rightly,’ and to be able to think of success in life as measured by the fulfilment of that desire, is the indication and warrant of true greatness of character.", "We Englishmen have ever loved to recognise this noble kind of devotion in our national heroes.     VI  METCHNIKOFF AND TOLSTOI   The Darwin celebration at Cambridge, in June 1909, brought a wonderful assemblage of celebrated biologists from all parts of the world to this country.", "There never has been seen such a company of great discoverers of all nationalities in the field of natural history and the science of living things, as were present in the University of Cambridge during that week.", "Even philosophers, moralists, and jurists were present to join with the one great political leader of our own country who really knows and appreciates the importance of the scientific study of Nature—the Right Hon.", "Arthur J. Balfour—in his fervent and heartfelt tribute to the influence of Darwin’s work and theory in all departments of human knowledge, thought, and activity.", "One of the most remarkable men present was Elie Metchnikoff.", "He represented both Russia, the country of his birth and earlier scientific work, and his adopted country, France, where, as sub director of the Institut Pasteur, his later and most important researches have been carried on.", "Russia was also represented by Salensky, late director of the Museum of St.", "Petersburg, well known to us all as a discoverer in the embryology (growth from the egg) of marine animals, and by Timiriazeff, the botanist, renowned for his work on the mode in which leaf green or chlorophyll enables green plants to obtain their food from the gases of the atmosphere.", "France had other representatives in Edmond Perrier, director of the Paris Museum, and Prince Roland Bonaparte.", "Metchnikoff was one of the four representatives selected by the University to deliver orations in the Senate House in honour of Darwin.", "He especially drew attention to the influence of Darwin’s theory on the study of disease.", "The recognition of the derivation of man from animal ancestors, and of the complete community of the structure and the chemical activity of the organs of man with those of the organs of animals, had made (he said) the study of the diseases of animals a necessary feature in the understanding of the diseases of man.", "The far reaching principle of Darwin that the mechanisms and processes observed in the bodies of plants and of animals (including man) must have been selected in the struggle for existence and perpetuated, because of their utility, led Metchnikoff to inquire what is the value or use of the process called inflammation and of the eating corpuscles, or phagocytes (so named by him), which wander from the blood into inflamed tissues.", "This question had led him to the discovery that the phagocytes engulf and destroy disease germs, and are the great protectors of the animal and human body against bacteria and other germs which enter cut and wounded surfaces, and would start disease were there not inflammation, which is nothing more nor less than a nerve regulated stagnation of the circulation of the blood at the wounded spot, and the consequent arrival at this spot of thousands of phagocytes, which pass out of the stagnant blood through the walls of the fine blood vessels.", "These armies of phagocytes proceed to eat up and destroy all the germs which fall on to the wound—from the air, from dirty surfaces, and from the skin.", "The utility of inflammation and its gradual development, according to Darwinian principles, in the animal series, was shown twenty years ago by Metchnikoff.", "His important work on immunity and on infection and on protection against germ caused disease is thus seen to be one of the many flourishing and valuable branches of knowledge which have originated from Darwin’s great conception and his example in experiment and inquiry.", "Metchnikoff is now devoting all his attention to the possibility of prolonging human life.", "The facts seem to show that if we ate and drank only what is best for us, and led lives regulated by reason and knowledge, we should, nearly all, attain to 80 or even 100 years of age, having healthy minds and healthy bodies.", "We should die quietly and comfortably at the end, with much the same feeling of contentment in well earned final repose as that which we now experience in going to sleep at the end of a long and happy day of healthy exercise and activity.", "Metchnikoff thinks that the causes of too early death may be ascertained, and when ascertained avoided or removed.", "In 1870, in a little book on _Comparative Longevity_, I distinguished what we may call the possible life, or potential longevity, of any given human being from his or her expectation of life.", "Potential longevity has been well called our lease of life.", "It is probably not very different in different races of men or individuals, and is probably higher than King David thought, being 100 to 120 years, and not merely 70 years.", "We all, or nearly all, fail to last out our lease owing to accidents, violence, and avoidable, as well as unavoidable, disease; so that 70 years is named as our tenure when the injury done to us by unhealthy modes of life and by actual disease are considered as inevitable.", "Metchnikoff proposes to discover and to avoid those conditions which wear down most of us and produce senility and death before we have really run out our lease of life.", "Human beings die most abundantly in the earliest years of life.", "Statistics show that at birth the chance or expectation of life is only 45 years, whilst at 10 years old you may expect to live to be 61.", "At 30 you have not a much better chance—you will probably, if you are what is called a healthy life, die when you are 65.", "But if you survive to be 50 you may expect, if you have not any obvious disease or signs of break up, another twenty years, and will probably die at 70; surviving to 60, you may expect, if you are what passes for healthy, to live to 73.", "Now, it is especially with regard to life after 40 or 50 years of age that Metchnikoff is interested.", "Those who have survived the special dangers and difficulties of youth, and have arrived at this mature age, ought to be able to realise much more frequently than they do something like the full lease of life. There seems to be no reason why they should not avoid the usual rapid senile changes or weakness of old age, and survive, as a few actually do, to something like 100.", "The causes of senile change and the way to defeat their operation are what Metchnikoff is studying.", "Hardening of the walls of the arteries set up by certain avoidable diseases contracted in earlier life, and by the use of alcohol (not only to the degree which we call drunkenness, but to such a degree as to make one depend on it as a pick me up), is an undoubted cause of that weakness and liability to succumb to other diseases which is so general after 50 years of age.", "The causes which produce hardened arteries can be avoided.", "Another cause of senile changes is declared by Metchnikoff, to arise from the continual absorption of poisonous substances produced by the decomposition of partially digested food in the lower bowel or large intestine.", "This is at present the chief subject of his study.", "It is to prevent the formation of these poisons that he has introduced the use of sour milk, prepared with the lactic ferment.", "Since the Cambridge celebration he has been in London in order to examine the condition of certain patients from whom a distinguished English surgeon has found it necessary to remove the large intestine. Metchnikoff wishes to ascertain what bacteria, poison producing or other, are present in these patients, and what is their general chemical condition now that this poison producing part of the digestive canal has been taken from them.", "In Paris, Metchnikoff has some very interesting experiments in progress with bats.", "He uses the large tropical fruit eating bats, or flying foxes. They have a very short intestine, and very few bacteria and of very few kinds are to be found in its contents.", "On the other hand, there are as many as thirty distinct kinds of bacteria producing putrefaction or other chemical change in the digestive canal of man—and their quantity is gigantic.", "They pervade the whole contents of the human digestive canal by millions.", "By properly feeding the flying foxes in his laboratory in Paris Metchnikoff has actually succeeded in getting rid of all bacteria from their digestive canal, so that he now has adult mammalian animals, not very remote from man in their structure, food, and internal chemistry, which are absolutely free from the intestinal parasitic bacteria which he supposes to cause poisoning and senile changes in man.", "It is obvious, without pursuing the matter into further detail here, that Metchnikoff is now in a position to test his views as to the action of particular kinds of bacteria—he has animals which are free from them.", "He can make an experiment, keeping some of his bats still free from bacteria and causing some to be largely infected by this or that kind, and he can compare the result in regard to the health and chemical condition of the animals.", "So, too, the patients from whom the lower intestine has been removed may very probably furnish him (through his assistant who remains in London) with important facts for comparison with the condition of persons who have not been deprived of this part of the digestive apparatus.", "I have given this sketch of what my friend is doing in order to furnish some notion of the kind of investigation which he pursues.", "He does not expect to extend the lease of human life, but by ascertaining in a definite scientific way the true rules of internal and external hygiene he does hope to give mankind an increased expectation of life; in fact, to enable a vastly larger number of men and women to enjoy that lease to the full, and to die without disappointment and regret, even with contentment and pleasure, at the end of it.", "Metchnikoff was in Russia in the spring of 1909, and spent a day with Tolstoi.", "They were fêted and photographed together, the greatest artist and the greatest scientist of Russia.", "Tolstoi is 81 years of age.", "He took Metchnikoff out alone for a drive in his pony cart so as to talk with him without interruption.", "What do you think of life? was the first question he asked, and one which it took my friend some time to answer.", "In regard to vegetarianism the two great men did not agree.", "When Metchnikoff declared that there was less cruelty on man’s part in killing wild animals to eat them than in leaving them to die by the tooth and claw of predaceous animals or from starvation, Tolstoi observed that that was argument and reason, and that he paid no attention to them; he only guided himself (he said) by sentiment, which he felt sure told him what was good and right!", "He was, however, deeply interested in an account of the cannibalism of savage races of men, concerning which he seemed to be quite uninformed.", "He also was profoundly interested in Metchnikoff’s view that Goethe, in the second part of _Faust_, is chiefly bent upon depicting the persistence of the amorous passion in old age—of which Goethe himself was an example—and Tolstoi declared that this gave a new meaning to the poem, which he had always hitherto found dull and unintelligible.", "But when Metchnikoff described in glowing words the joy and even rapture with which man will hereafter welcome the repose and mystery of death, having completed a long and healthy life of some hundred years, Tolstoi declared that this was indeed a fine conception, although it was entirely subversive of his own notions as to the significance of life and death.", "Tolstoi also stated that he had written his stories rapidly and without effort, but that his essays on morality and religion had cost him great labour; and, further, that he could not now remember the former, though the latter still were developing and incessantly occupied his thought.", "It was admitted with regret by Darwin that he ceased in middle age to care for poetry and art, though there seems to be no doubt that he mistook fatigue and preoccupation of mind for a real change in taste and power of appreciation.", "It is interesting to place beside this the case of the great literary artist, Tolstoi, who not only frankly confesses that he refuses to be guided by reason and follows sentiment, but is also profoundly ignorant upon all the most ordinary topics of human life outside his own village, and of all Nature and her workings.", "Would Tolstoi have been a greater or a smaller artist if he had had a larger knowledge of the things that are?", "Was Darwin’s great scientific achievement really related to an innate indifference to what is called poetry?", "I will not now discuss the matter, but I am convinced that so far as natural gift is concerned, the keenest scientific capacity is not only compatible with the fullest sensibility to art and with the power of poetical vision and expression, but is often accompanied by them; and, further, that the work of an artist, if he is a great artist, cannot be hampered by knowledge.", "It is only the small talent or the feeble genius that can be paralysed rather than developed by the fullest experience and the widest knowledge.", "Necessary incompatibility of mental qualities has no place in this matter; what has led to the erroneous assumption that it has, is the excessive exercise by exceptional individuals of certain powers—a specialism necessary for effort and success, but deliberately chosen, and not due to an inborn one sidedness.", "VII  THE LAND OF AZURE BLUE   The Côte d’Azur whither many of my readers will be travelling—in thought, if not in reality—about Easter time, is well named the Land of Azure Blue, for it is the blueness of the sea, of the sky, and of the distant rocks and mountains, as well as much of the vegetation, which is when the sun shines, its special charm.", "And although one has some wet and some cloudy days, yet the sun does shine there with a strength and brilliancy not to be enjoyed in the early part of the year on the Atlantic and North Sea coast.", "This tract of country, more commonly known to English people as the Riviera, has very special meteorological conditions owing to its position as the narrow strip of shore line existing between the vast mass of the Western Alps and the Mediterranean Sea.", "It is warmed by the sea, and lies too close under the mountains to be caught by any winds from the north, and at many points is also effectively protected from both east and west winds by rocky spurs of the great mountain chain.", "The Riviera is a constant source of delight to those who love flowers and beautiful vegetation of all kinds.", "But few of its visitors appreciate the fact that it is really from end to end one big garden, cultivated for ages by its inhabitants, and full of plants introduced by man which at present seem at first sight to be characteristic natives of it, but are, in reality, quite distinct from its primitive vegetation.", "This primitive vegetation is now represented only in what is locally called the maquis—what we should, perhaps, term the scrub or bush in English.", "It comprises some pines, the juniper, the lovely rock roses, balsams, rosemary, the giant heath (bruyère), from which our briar root pipes are made, the larger thyme, the myrtle, the rose of Provence, two kinds of lavender, and many aromatic plants with grey hairy leaves, and often provided with sharp thorns as additional defences against browsing goats.", "The delicious perfumes of these hardy inhabitants of the dry, rocky grounds, where little or no grass can flourish, are developed by them as a protection against browsing animals, who cannot tolerate much of these pungent volatile oils, although mankind extracts them and uses them in the manufacture of such scents as eau de Cologne and also in cookery.", "Many a visitor to the Riviera never strays from the cultivated fields and roadways into this scrub land.", "The olive tree, which forms so prominent and beautiful a feature in the panorama of gardens which unrolls itself as we steam or drive along the coast from Toulon to Mentone and from Mentone to Genoa and Spezzia, is not a native plant; it was introduced in prehistoric times, and has been again and again re established by emigrants from Italy; but it was brought to Italy from the East.", "It is astonishing how many of the cultivated trees of the Riviera have the same kind of history—the vine came from India in prehistoric times, the fig tree more recently from Persia, the lemon from India, the orange and the peach tree from China.", "All of them were introduced in very ancient times to the eastern parts of the Mediterranean basin, and so gradually were carried to the shores of the Ligurian sea, and would die out here were they not to a certain extent under the care of ownership.", "The so called mimosa, so abundant here, with its pretty, sweet scented, yellow blossom, is an Australian acacia, only introduced some sixty years ago; whilst the eucalyptus—a most picturesque and effective addition to the landscape—is a still later introduction from Australia.", "The cypress, that darkest and most shapely of conifers, long lines of which proclaim to the traveller as he passes Avignon his arrival in the true South, is not a native of these parts, although it flourishes in suitable situations.", "It was introduced in mediæval times from the East.", "So, too, the palms, though some have been cultivated for centuries, have been largely imported from extra European localities in the last century.", "There is a native European palm.", "It is a kind of fan palm, and grows here.", "I have gathered it in Sicily.", "It does not rear its stately head more than a foot from the ground, and is known to botanists as _Chamærops humilis_.", "The gigantic Mexican agave and the prickly pear cactus were introduced in the seventeenth century from the New World, though, according to Sir Herbert Tree’s scenery, they were growing at Cape Miseno in the time of Antony and Cleopatra!", "Bamboos of many kinds have been introduced here from the Far East, and flourish exceedingly.", "The orange tree was brought from India (whither it was carried from China) and established in Southern Europe in mediæval times, though known to the ancient Greeks and Romans.", "There are as many as 120 different varieties of the orange tree now cultivated on the shores of the Mediterranean, including, besides those which are valued for their sweet juicy pulp, those which furnish bergamot oil and similar aromatic products.", "The issue pea of old apothecaries, which was bound into a cut made in a patient’s flesh for the purpose of producing inflammation and suppuration, with the notion that such treatment was beneficial, was a minute unripe orange dried, and, no doubt, to some extent, antiseptic.", "Besides the introduced trees, we find, in ground which has been more or less under cultivation, and not, therefore, of the nature of the maquis, or scrub land, some beautiful plants, such as the narcissus, iris, and various lilies.", "One very small and graceful tulip is, I believe, regarded as native to the soil, but a magnificent crimson tulip, as large as the varieties cultivated in English gardens, which I have found abundantly in open park like land under olive trees at Antibes, is said to have been introduced from Persia in the Middle Ages, and to have taken kindly to the Riviera.", "It is the _Tulipa oculus solis_.", "In the same locality were growing many brilliantly coloured stellate anemones.", "There is, of course, a third group or lot of plants on the Riviera, which consists of those brought from all parts of the world during the past century, and regularly cultivated and cared for in gardens.", "The climate of the Riviera enables the gardener to grow all sorts of sub tropical plants in the open air, and a long list of them could be given.", "The wonderfully brilliant crimson creeper, Bougainvillia, covers walls by the roadways, and even the railway stations, with its rich colour at this season.", "A delightful book by the distinguished botanist, Professor Strasburger, describing and picturing in colours many of the cultivated as well as the wild plants of the Riviera, has lately been published (in English) at a small price.", "The animals which come under the notice of those who go in search of spring sunshine to the Riviera are far less numerous than the plants.", "But there is one which is dear to all, although it makes such a noise for an hour or so about sunset that some people are irritated or even alarmed by it.", "This is the little green tree frog, Fig.", "1, which now comes forth from its winter sleep, and assembles in thousands—guided by the croak or call which is produced by the males.", "The females have a very small voice comparatively.", "I kept two—a male and female—through a winter in London, and when the spring came the male terrified the household one night by unexpectedly uttering his cry—loud and sharp—to which the female replied.", "Wharr!", "biz is the nearest expression I can give in letters to the two sounds.", "After a great many evenings spent in these rhythmical declamations, the little frogs collect round pools and tanks, and at last drop from the trees into the water, and there deposit their spawn.", "When producing his cry the male distends the skin of his throat like a balloon.", "The air is driven alternately from it into the lungs and back again over the vocal chords, which vibrate with no uncertain sound.", "These little frogs are easy to keep in an inverted bell jar or in a fern case, but must be fed regularly with flies and spiders, which they catch by a sudden dab of the tongue at the moment of alighting from a long leap on to the glass where the insect is crawling.", "They can hold on to smooth glass or leaves by means of their sucker like toes (Fig.", "1).", "The colour of the upper surface of the South European tree frog is a most vivid and smoothly laid on grass green.", "Occasionally the colour becomes altered to a brownish purple, but returns after a day or two to its usual bright green tint.", "A great rarity is the blue variety of this frog—the enchanted Prince of the Côte d’Azur—blue as the sky and the sea around him—the true _genius loci_.", "I obtained one a few years ago at Mentone, and kept it alive for three years in London.", "Its blue was the blue of the forget me not or the finest turquoise.", "When it died (I believe of old age, and not from discomfort or disease) I examined its skin very carefully with the microscope, and compared it with that of the ordinary green tree frog, in order to make out the cause of their difference in colour.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "1.—The little green tree frog or rainette of the Riviera (_Hyla arborea_).", "From Professor Gadow’s volume on _Reptiles and Amphibia_—in the Cambridge Natural History—published by Macmillan & Co., by whose permission this figure is here produced.]", "At Mentone there is a little shop where one may purchase green tree frogs and ornamental cages in which to keep them.", "Every year the dealer has two or three specimens of the blue variety on sale—their backs and heads looking like bits of turquoise blue kid.", "Visitors have sometimes wrongly supposed that the blue frogs had been artificially changed in colour, but they are real, natural varieties.", "A similar substitution of blue for green has been noticed as a rare variation in other kinds of frogs and toads in other countries.", "It really consists in a suppression of yellow pigment.", "The interesting thing about the colour of the little tree frogs is that we find, on careful examination of the skin of a dead specimen with the microscope, that there is no green nor yet any blue pigment present in it.", "I found, on examining the blue specimen which died after living three years with me, that there is only black pigment overlaid by a colourless, semi transparent layer of skin.", "In this outer skin in the ordinary green specimens there is scattered a quantity of excessively minute yellow particles, which, mixed with the blue, produce the green appearance.", "The fact is, that the wonderful dead turquoise blue of the blue frog is a colour effect similar to that of the blue sky and the blue of the human eye.", "It is produced by a peculiar reflection of the light from minute colourless particles, without the assistance of any blue coloured substance.", "The distinction of these two modes of producing blue colour is important.", "Certain transparent bodies are so constituted that when a beam of light is directed so as to pass through them, the red, yellow, green, and purple rays which exist in colourless sunlight are stopped, and only the blue rays come through.", "Such a body is blue copperas, or sulphate of copper; another is methyl blue, one of the aniline dyes; another is pure water, which gives only a slight advantage to the blue rays, so that the light must pass through a thickness of 30 feet or more before the blue tint is obvious.", "Thus, part of the blueness of the Côte d’Azur is accounted for—namely, the blueness of the sea when the sunlight is strong and is reflected from the white rocks and sand lying 30 feet to 100 feet below the surface of the water.", "There are, of course, other self coloured transparent bodies which allow only rays of one colour to pass.", "Thus, blood red, or hæmoglobin, the pigment of the blood, allows chiefly red rays to pass through it.", "Yellow rays only pass through a solution of saffron or of chromic acid; green only or chiefly through green copperas (sulphate of iron) or through leaf green or chlorophyll.", "Colour is very generally due in natural objects to such transparent bodies which absorb or stop all the coloured rays of light as it passes through them, excepting those of one tint—or, to be more correct, nearly all except those of one tint.", "But the blue of the blue frog and a great deal of the blue in nature is due to another cause.", "If you are a smoker, or the friend of a smoker, watch the fine curling lines of smoke ascending from a cigar when it is being consumed in bright sunshine.", "You will see that it has a blue, even an azure blue, tint as the sunlight falls upon it.", "But if you let the smoke get between the sun and your eyes you will notice that the little curling clouds are no longer blue, but reddish brown, in appearance.", "The smoke is not a transparent blue; looked at as a transparent body, it is brown!", "Further, when the smoke has passed into the smoker’s mouth and is ejected after remaining there for a few seconds, the cloud no longer looks blue, even when the sunlight falls on it and is reflected from it to your eye.", "It is now opaque white or colourless, with, perhaps, a faint tinge of blue.", "This change is due—as was shown by the experiments of the late Professor Tyndall upon a variety of clouds and vapours—to the cooling of the smoke and the increased size of the floating particles which coalesce as the temperature falls.", "The larger particles reflect white light, and the cloud is no longer blue.", "A cloud formed by the finest particles gives the strongest blue to the light reflected from it, and it is to this property of the finest particles of water cloud floating in our atmosphere that the blue colour of the sky is due.", "No doubt the question arises, Why do clouds of the finest particles reflect a predominant amount of blue light rather than yellow or green or red? That question is answered by mathematicians in accordance with what is ascertained as to the nature and properties of light, but it would require a long treatise to put those matters even in outline before the reader.", "We may in the meanwhile accept the conclusions of the physicists, and interest ourselves in seeing how they apply to some of the concrete facts about colour in Nature.", "There are other instances of blueness due to the reflection of light from a cloud of excessively minute particles besides that of the azure sky and the blue, curling smoke of a wood fire.", "A familiar instance is the blueness of translucent bodies, such as the white of a boiled plover’s egg, especially when a bit of it is placed on a dead black ground.", "The bluish appearance of watered London milk is another instance.", "These bodies look blue owing to the fine, colourless particles suspended in them, which act on light in the same way as do the fine particles of newly produced smoke.", "Another very interesting case is the blue colour of the iris of the eye of man and other animals.", "It is not due to any blue pigment, but to a reflection from fine particles in the translucent, but turbid, tissue of the iris overlying the dark, black chamber of the eye.", "White geese and white cats frequently have blue eyes, the blue being thus produced.", "The only pigment which occurs in the human eye is a brown one, which gives a colour varying from amber yellow to very dark brown, almost black, according to the quantity present.", "When a very little of it is present it gives, in combination with the blue appearance of the unpigmented iris, a green tint, so that green eyes owe their colour to the same combination of causes as does the green skin of the little tree frogs, or rainettes.  No solvent will extract any pigment from the skin of the blue frog—nor by the finest trituration can one obtain any coloured particles from it; only fine black granules can be separated.", "Alcohol removes the yellow pigment from the skin of a green tree frog (killed, of course, for the experiment), and for a minute or two the skin becomes blue when its yellow pigment is thus removed by immersion in spirit; but it rapidly becomes a dull greyish brown in colour, and so remains; the green cannot be preserved in spirit specimens.", "It is not fully explained how such a uniform dead blue is produced by the reflection of light from fine particles, as that observed in the blue frog’s skin.", "It appears that the blue and the green colour in the feathers of birds is in most, if not all, cases produced in the same way as the blue and green of the tree frog’s skin.", "It would be interesting were it found possible to produce a full dead blue colour by experimentally placing a coat of a translucent but turbid colourless medium on a dead black plate.", "This, however, has not been done as a deliberate experiment.", "It is, however, recorded that Goethe was delighted to find what he considered to be a confirmation of his theory of colour when a friend showed him an oil painting of a gentleman in a black coat which when wetted with a sponge turned bright blue.", "The picture had been recently restored, and the varnish on the black coat was not dry. It was precipitated by the water from the sponge, mixing with the spirit which held it in solution.", "A fine colourless cloud was thus produced overlying the black paint of the coat, and, as in the case of the cerulean frog, a dead blue colour, due to reflection of the light by the fine particles, was the result.", "Some friendly physicist might repeat this experiment and study the matter in detail.", "The red, orange, and yellow colours of birds’ feathers are produced by pigments which are either insoluble or only soluble with great difficulty in fluids of the nature of ether.", "There is, however, an exception in the case of the African birds called Turacous, or Plantain eaters.", "These birds have some large quill feathers in the wing of a rich crimson colour.", "This splendid red pigment can be washed out of the feathers by water which is slightly alkaline, and a fine blood red solution is obtained.", "Why this curious exception exists we do not know.", "The extracted colour is found to contain the element copper as one of its chemical components.", "Plantain eaters kept in cages have sometimes washed all the colour out of their feathers owing to the water supplied to them for bathing and drinking having become foul and ammoniacal, and thus capable of dissolving the red pigment.", "The cultivation on the Riviera of flowers for sale as cut flowers in Paris, London, and Berlin, in the colder months of the year, is now an enormous business, bringing many thousands of pounds yearly to the small gardeners around Hyères, St.", "Raphael, Nice, and Mentone.", "Roses, violets, carnations, mimosa of various kinds, anemones, lilies, and narcissus are sent literally in tons by quick trains several times a week from these realms of sunshine to the dreary North.", "The commencement of this trade was due to the suggestion made some fifty years ago by Alphonse Karr, the French poet and journalist, who had a beautiful garden of his own at St.", "Raphael, and found that he could produce flowers in profusion through the winter.", "Two years ago I visited this garden (which now belongs to a French painter) at the beginning of April, and found it full of interesting flowers and shrubs, enormous bamboos, palm trees, some twenty different mimosas, eucalyptus of several species, camellia trees, and rose bushes in quantity.", "The influence of man on the vegetation of a favoured locality like the Riviera is more striking than in the North.", "But it is worth remembering that the most familiar tree in England—the common elm—is not a native, but introduced from South Europe.", "Our native elm is the wych elm, or mountain elm—a much handsomer tree, in the opinion of many, than the so called common elm. There are doubts as to whether both the spruce and the larch were not introduced by man at a very remote time, so that the Scotch fir would be our only aboriginal pine.", "The oak, beech, birch, ash, hawthorn, poplar, and alder are undoubted native English trees.", "The holly oak or evergreen oak, the sycamore, plane tree, sweet chestnut, horse chestnut, walnut, and probably the lime or linden tree have been introduced by migrating men at various periods into our islands.", "With the exception of rye and oats none of the plants which we cultivate for food are derived from our own wild plants, and none of our domesticated animals have been produced from native wild kinds.", "VIII  FRESH WATER JELLY FISHES   Most people nowadays know a jelly fish when they see one—and recognise that it is eminently a product of the sea—one sees them washed up on the seashore, soft discs of transparent jelly of the size of cheese plates (Fig.", "2).", "They have a mouth in the centre of the disc, often at the end of a depending trunk, like the clapper of a bell.", "Some have tentacles, sometimes yards long, which sting like nettles.", "They also have eye spots, an internal system of canals and muscles which enable them to swim by causing the edge of the disc or bell to contract and expand in alternate strokes.", "There are hundreds of kinds of marine jelly fish varying in size from a sixpence to that of a dinner table, and until twenty five years ago none were known to live in ponds, lakes, or rivers.", "Although they often are carried up estuaries, and may stay for a time in brackish water, or even in fresh water, none were known which really lived and bred in fresh water.", "They were regarded, as are star fishes and sea urchins, as distinctively marine, and debarred by the delicacy of their watery jelly like substance from tolerating the change from sea water to fresh water as a permanent thing.", "All fresh water animals—fishes, shell fish, cray fish, worms, and polyps—are derived from closely similar marine animals, are in fact sea things which have suffered a change, and been able to stand it.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "2.—The common jelly fish (_Aurelia aurita_) one third the natural size; _or_, one of the four arms or fleshy tentacles surrounding the diamond shaped mouth; _Tc_, one of the eight eye bearing tentacles at the edge of the disc; _GP_, opening of one of the four sub genital pouches, which bring sea water close to the ovaries and spermaries, which, however, do not open into these pouches; _x_ and _y_, outline of the sub genital pouches seen through the jelly.]", "These being our preconceptions about jelly fish, great was the excitement when, in 1880, hundreds of beautiful little jelly fish were suddenly discovered briskly expanding and contracting, rising and sinking in the water of a large fresh water tank in the middle of London (Fig.", "3).", "You never know who or what may turn up in London.", "A badger, a green parakeet, a whale, an African pigmy, an Indian scorpion, and a voice worth ten thousand a year, have all, to my knowledge, been stumbled upon unexpectedly at different times in the highways of London.", "A new jelly fish was perhaps one of the least expected casual visitors. It was found in the large tank four feet deep in which the great tropical water lily—the Victoria regia—and other tropical water plants are grown in the Botanic Gardens, Regent’s Park.", "It came up by hundreds every year for some ten years after its first appearance, dying down in six weeks or so each season.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "3.—The fresh water jelly fish (_Limnocodium_) enlarged four times linear measurement, as it is seen dropping through the water in a glass jar.", "_PT_, one of the four principal tentacles.", "_MR_, the margin of the disc.", "_Ve_, the delicate muscular frill or velum.]", "All the specimens were males, and the puzzle was to find out how it reproduced itself.", "After a few seasons had passed I determined to solve this problem.", "I made the guess that perhaps the jelly fish were budded off from a fixed weed like polyp growing in the depths of the tank—as is the case with many of the marine jelly fishes.", "I remember that one leading member of the council, which still presides over the destinies of the Botanic Gardens, confided to me in a hushed whisper his belief that Providence created this new jelly fish year by year in the tank in honour of the august patroness of the Botanic Society—Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Teck.", "I was obliged to make an end of this flattering theory when I discovered, after long searching with my assistant—attached to the rootlets of floating water weeds a minute three branched polyp (Fig.", "4), from which, as we subsequently were able to observe, the jelly fish were pinched off as tiny spheres about one sixteenth of an inch in diameter.", "No females of this jelly fish were ever discovered.", "The polyps lived on from year to year, and budded off each season a swarm of pretty but futile male jelly fish.", "They ripened and died on attaining a diameter somewhat less than that of a shilling.", "There were many most interesting points made out as to their structure, mode of feeding, and growth.", "You could keep them in a tall glass jar supported over a small gas jet (they lived best at a temperature of 80° Fahr.", "), and they would swim up by a series of strokes to the top of the water, and then drop like little parachutes through the eighteen inches of depth to the bottom—taking in water fleas and such food on the way—and immediately would start upwards again.", "I used to take them alive in my pocket corked up in a test tube to show to friends.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "4.—Four of the minute club shaped polyps adhering to a root fibre of a water plant.", "The rounded end becomes nipped off and swims away, free, as a young jelly fish.]", "After they had disappeared from the tank in Regent’s Park (owing to some unhappy cleaning of the tank) they suddenly, in 1903, appeared—it seems incredible—at Sheffield!", "Then they briefly showed up in 1905 at Munich, and at Lyons had been captured in 1901—always in a tepid water lily tank!", "We never could make out where they came from originally.", "Of course, the polyp must have been brought into the tank with some bundle of water plants from a tropical lake or river, but we never had any indication as to when or which.", "Since the days of the fresh water jelly fish of Regent’s Park, which was called (a name, but why should it not have a name?)", "_Limnocodium Sowerbii_—a jelly fish of about the same size (Fig.", "5) but very different in shape and tentacles—was discovered in the great African fresh water lake Tanganyika—in enormous numbers, and was named _Limnocnida Tanganyikæ_.", "Only five years ago the same jelly fish was discovered in the Victoria Nyanza, and a little earlier in backwaters of the Niger.", "It is a curious and significant fact bearing upon the history of these three areas of fresh water connected with the three greatest African rivers—the Congo, the Nile, and the Niger—that the same little jelly fish is found in all of them.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "5.—The African fresh water jelly fish (_Limnocnida_) found in Tanganyika, Victoria Nyanza, and the Niger.]", "And now we have just been reminded of _Limnocodium_, the Regents Park jelly fish, from a remote and unexpected source.", "A thousand miles up the Yang tse Kiang River, in China, in the province of Hupi, the Japanese captain of a river steamer, plying there and belonging to a Japanese company, captured ten jelly fish in the muddy waters of the river.", "He brought them home, preserved, I suppose, in alcohol or formalin, and they have been described by Dr.", "Oka, a Japanese zoologist of Tokio, in a publication bearing the Latin title _Annotationes Zoologicæ niponenses_, issued in December 1907.", "European sea captains have not rarely been ardent naturalists, but I think the Japanese is the first captain of a river steamboat who has discovered a new animal on his beat.", "I have not heard of Mississippi steamboat captains amusing themselves in this way—other rivers, other tastes.", "Dr.", "Oka describes the jelly fish thus brought to him as a _Limnocodium_, differing in a few details from that of Regent’s Park, so that he distinguishes this Chinese species as _Limnocodium Kawaii_, naming it after the naturalist captain, who must have a rare taste for picking up strange and new things, and a rare goodwill in bringing them home with him.", "So here is another fresh water jelly fish, for it is not the same as the Regent’s Park one, though closely like it.", "Possibly _Limnocodium_ is an Asiatic genus, and the original Sowerby’s _Limnocodium_ will be found in another Chinese river.", "But it may prove to be South American, as is the water lily Victoria regia.", "A very small fresh water jelly fish was found some twelve years ago—in 1897—in the Delaware River at Philadelphia, United States, and was lately described by the well known naturalist, Mr.", "Potts.", "It was budded off from a very minute polyp resembling that found in the Regent’s Park, but the jelly fish was totally different from _Limnocodium_.", "Only four or five specimens of this jelly fish have ever been seen, and the Philadelphian naturalists ought certainly to look it up again.", "An account of the Philadelphian jelly fish and of other fresh water jelly fishes, with illustrative plates, will be found in the _Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science_, 1906.", "Mr.", "Charles Boulenger has, in the same Journal, 1908, described yet another fresh water jelly fish from the Fayoum Lake in Egypt.", "IX  THE STORY OF THE COMMON EEL   Though the Scotch Highlanders are said to have a profound objection to eating eels on account of the resemblance of these fish to snakes (not a very good reason, since the quality and not the shape of what one eats is the important thing), yet eels have been a very popular delicacy in England in past days.", "Eel pie Island, at Richmond, is known to most Londoners, and eel pie shops were familiar in London less than a century ago.", "A good Thames eel is still appreciated by the few people who nowadays take some small amount of intelligent interest in what they eat.", "Abroad, eels are still popular.", "Eel traps are still worked in the rivers.", "In such districts as the flat country, on the shores of the Adriatic, near Venice, millions of young eels are annually shepherded in lagoons and reservoirs, and reared to marketable size.", "The inland eel fisheries of Denmark and Germany are carefully regulated and encouraged by the Government in those States.", "The fact is that railways, ice storage, and steam trawling have, in conjunction, revolutionised our habits in regard to the use of fish as a daily article of diet.", "Fresh water fish are now almost unknown as a regular source of food in the British Islands.", "The splendid fish of the North Sea, the Channel, and the Atlantic coast have pushed them out of the market.", "Thirty eight years ago, when I was a student in Leipzig and Vienna, baked carp was the only fish to be had in the dining rooms we frequented.", "Once a week there were fresh haddock, for those who fancied them, in the celebrated Auerbach’s Keller.", "Now the railway and packing in ice have brought North Sea fish to the centre of Europe, and created a taste for that excellent food.", "Even on the Mediterranean at Nice, I lately saw North Sea turbot, soles, and haddock lying on the marble slabs in the fish market side by side with the handsome but small bass, mullet, gurnards, and sea bream of the local fishery, and the carp, pike, trout, and eels of the fresh waters of the South of France.", "Nevertheless the eel—the common fresh water eel—is still valued on the Continent, as is proved by the fact that the German Imperial Government has recently sent an important official of the Fisheries Department to Gloucester in order to make extensive purchases of the elvers, or young eels which come up the river Severn in millions at this season.", "The purpose of the German fisheries officials is to place many hundred thousands of these young eels in German rivers which are not so well supplied by natural immigration as is the Severn, and by so doing to increase the supply of well grown eels hereafter in the river fisheries of North Germany.", "This interesting practical attempt to increase the supply of eels in Germany will be further appreciated when I relate what has been discovered within the last twenty years as to the reproduction, migrations, and habits of the common fresh water eel.", "It has been known, time out of mind, that in the early months of every year millions of young eels a little over two inches in length, called elvers in English and civelles in French, come up the estuaries of the rivers of Europe in a dense body.", "They are so closely packed together as the narrower parts of the stream are reached, that thousands may be taken out of the water by merely dipping a bucket into the ranks of the procession.", "I obtained a few thousand of these elvers lately from the Severn and placed them on exhibition in the central court of the Natural History Museum in London.", "The Anglo Saxon name eel fare is given to this annual march or swim of the young eels from the sea to the fresh waters.", "Though riverside folk have never doubted that the elvers are young eels which have been hatched from spawn deposited by parent eels in the sea, and are running up to feed and grow to maturity in the rivers and streams inland, yet country folk away from the big rivers have queer notions as to the origin and breeding of eels.", "They catch large, plump eels a couple of feet long in stagnant ponds hundreds of miles from the sea, far from rivers, and more than a thousand feet above the sea level.", "They have no notion that those eels originally ran up as little eels from the sea, nor that many of them make their way across wet grass and by rain filled ditches back to the rivers and to the sea when they are seven years old.", "But that is now known to be the fact.", "Just as there are fish, like the salmon, which run down to the sea to feed and grow big and run up to breed in the small pools and rivulets far from the river’s mouth, so there are other fishes, of which the eel is one, which run up to feed and grow and run down to breed—that is to say, to deposit and fertilise their eggs in the depths of the ocean.", "Fishermen who work river fisheries for eels (far more valued abroad than in England) distinguish yellow eels and silver eels (see Plate I. opposite title page).", "We used to distinguish also snigs and grigs, or narrow nosed and broad nosed eels (probably males and females).", "The remarkable fact, admitted by both fishermen and anatomists, was that you could not really tell male from female, nor, indeed, ever find an eel (that is, a common eel, as distinguished from the much larger and well known conger eel) which was ripe, or, indeed, showed any signs of having either roe or milt within it.", "A popular legend exists that eels are produced by the vivification of horse hair.", "Occasionally in summer a long, black, and very thin threadworm (called _Gordius_ by naturalists) suddenly appears in great numbers in rivers, and these are declared by the country folk to be horse hairs on their way to become eels!", "I remember a sudden swarm of them one summer in the upper river at Oxford.", "Really, they are parasitic worms which live inside insects for a part of their lives, and leave them in summer, passing into the water.", "Fanciful beliefs about aquatic creatures are common, because it is not very easy to get at the truth when it is not merely at the bottom of a well but at the bottom of a river or of the deep sea!", "The fishermen of the east coast of Scotland, who think very highly of their own knowledge and intelligence, believe that the little white sea acorns or rock barnacles are the young of the limpets which live side by side with them, and are scornful of those who deny the correctness of what they consider an obvious conclusion!", "A few years ago the Scandinavian naturalist, Petersen, showed that the silver eels are a later stage of growth of the yellow eels; that they acquire a silvery coat, and that the eye increases in size—as a sort of wedding dress, just before they go down to the sea to breed.", "I owe to Petersen’s kindness the coloured drawings of the heads of the yellow and the silver eel reproduced in Plate I. These silver eels are caught in some numbers about the Danish coast and river mouths, moving downwards; and Petersen has been able to distinguish the males from the females by finding the still incompletely formed milt and roe within the silver eels.", "Not only that, but one of Petersen’s assistants at the Danish Biological Station has found that you can tell the age of an eel by the zones or rings shown by its scales, when examined with a microscope, just as the age of trees can be told by the annual rings of growth in the wood.", "Most people, even if familiar with eels, even cooks who have skinned an eel, do not know that they have scales; but they have,—very small ones.", "The age of other fishes has been similarly ascertained by annual zones of growth marked on the scales; and lately the age of plaice has been found to be conveniently given by zones of growth formed annually on the little ear stones which we find in the liquid holding sac of the internal ear.", "I am afraid many of my readers will be surprised to learn that fishes have an internal hearing apparatus similar to our own, also that they have olfactory organs, and, in some cases, a well grown tongue!", "The power thus obtained of telling the age of an eel has led to the following knowledge about them, namely, that female eels do not become silver eels and run down before they are seven years old, and often not till eight and a half years of age, or even sometimes eleven or twelve years, when they are nearly 3 feet long.", "The male eel becomes silver (instead of yellow) at an earlier age—four and a half years,—and rarely defers his nuptial outburst until he is seven or eight years old.", "The females of the same age are larger than the males; a usual size for silver females of seven years old is a little over 2 feet, and of a silver male of the same age 20 inches.", "The further facts which I am about to relate as to the migration and reproduction of the common eel are of great interest.", "The common yellow eels of our ponds and rivers, as we have seen, when they are from five to seven years old and over, put on, as it were, a wedding dress.", "They become silver eels, and descend the rivers to the sea.", "There they produce their spawn.", "The young eels thus produced, when only 2 inches long, leave the sea.", "Every year they ascend the estuaries and rivers of Europe as elvers in enormous numbers, their procession up the rivers being known as the eel fare.  Some eels, shut up in moats and ponds, never escape—they become more or less silver and restless, but fail to get away.", "Others crawl up the banks in wet, warm weather, when the ponds are full to the brim, and over the meadows.", "They are found sometimes on their journey when they          ... have to pass   Through the dewy grass,  and so to the river, and on to the marriage feast in the deep sea.", "The fact is, that usually eels inhabit in large numbers the rivers and streams, and have no difficulty in getting down to the sea when they are adult.", "Those who, as young elvers, have wandered far off into sunken ponds and reservoirs, are eccentric spirits who have lost the normal way of life; like fellows of colleges in the old days, they have cut themselves off from the matrimonial running down, but they have compensations in quietude, abundant food, and a long life.", "We now know where the silver eels go when they run down the rivers.", "They go into the sea, of course; but we know more than that.", "It has now been discovered that they make their way for many miles along the sea bottom—in some cases hundreds of miles—to no less a depth than 500 fathoms.", "In the Mediterranean they don’t have very far to go, for there is very deep water near the land, and Professor Grassi found evidence of their presence in the depths of the Straits of Messina.", "But the eels of the rivers which empty into the North Sea and English Channel have much farther to go; they have to go right out to the deep water of the Atlantic, off the west coast of Ireland.", "That is the nearest point where 500 fathoms can be touched; there is no such depth in the North Sea nor in the Channel.", "They never come back, and no one has ever yet tracked them on their journey to the deep water.", "Yet we know that they go there, and lay their eggs there, and that from these remote fastnesses a new generation of eels, born in the dark unfathomed depths of ocean, return every year in their millions as little elvers to the rivers from which their parents swam forth in silver wedding dress.", "Soon, we have reason to hope, by the use of suitable deep sinking nets, we shall intercept, in the English Channel, some of the silver eels on their way to the Atlantic deeps.", "They must go in vast numbers, and yet no one has yet come across them.", "How, then, do we know that the silver eels ever go to this 500 fathom abysm?", "[Illustration  FIG.", "6.—Young stages of the common eel, drawn of the natural size by Professor Grassi.", "A, The _Leptocephalus_, transparent stage.", "D, the elver, or young eel, which is coloured, and of much smaller size than the transparent, colourless creature by the change of which it is produced.", "It is the elver which swims in millions up our rivers.", "B and C are intermediate stages, showing the gradual change of A into D.]", "The answer is as follows  A very curious, colourless, transparent, absolutely glass like, little fish, 2½ inches long, oblong and leaf like in shape, has been known for many years as a rarity, to be caught now and then, one at a time, floating near the top in summer seas (Fig.", "6).", "I used to get it at Naples occasionally many years ago, and it has sometimes been taken in the English Channel.", "It is known by the name Leptocephalus. Placed in a glass jar full of sea water it is nearly invisible on account of its transparency and freedom from colour.", "Even its blood is colourless.", "The eyes alone are coloured, and one sees these as two isolated black globes moving mysteriously to the right and the left as the invisible ghostly fish swims around.", "Twenty years ago one of these kept in an aquarium at Roscoff, in Brittany, gradually shrunk in breadth, became cylindrical, coloured and opaque, and assumed the complete characters of a young eel!", "To cut a long story short, these Leptocephali were found twelve years ago in large numbers in the deep water (400 fathoms) of the Straits of Messina by the Italian naturalists Grassi and Calandruccio, and they conclusively showed that they were the young phase—the tadpole, as it were—of eels.", "They showed that different kinds of eels—conger eels, the Muræna, and the common eel—have each their own kind of transparent Leptocephalus young phase, living in but also above the very deep water, in which they are hatched from the eggs of the parent eels.", "The Leptocephalus young when hatched, grow rapidly, and ascend to near the surface immediately above the deep water, and are caught at depths of ten to a hundred fathoms.", "To become elvers, or young eels, they have to undergo great change of shape and colour, and actually shrink in bulk—a process which has now been completely observed and described.", "It is not surprising that their true nature was not at first recognised.", "The proof that the silver eels of North and West Europe go down to the 500 fathom line off the Irish coast, in order to lay their eggs, is that the Danish naturalist Schmidt and his companions discovered there two years ago, above these great depths (and nowhere else), by employing a special kind of fine meshed trawling net, many thousands of the flat, glass like Leptocephalus young stage, or tadpole of the common eel, and traced them from there to their entrance into the various rivers.", "They showed that the Leptocephali gradually change on the way landward into eel like elvers.  The rivers nearest the deep water, such as those opening on the west coast of Ireland and on the Spanish and French shores of the Bay of Biscay, get their elvers running up as early as November, December, and January.", "The farther off the river the farther the elvers have to travel from the deep sea nursery, so that in Denmark they don’t appear until May.", "Not the least curious part of the migration of the eel is the passage of the young elvers into the higher parts of rivers and remote streams.", "They are sometimes seen a hundred miles from the sea, actually wriggling in numbers up the face of a damp rock or wall ten or fifteen feet high, pushing one another from below upwards, so as to scale the obstacle and reach higher waters, like Japanese soldiers at a fort.", "I found them (so long ago that I hesitate to name the date—it was a year of cholera in London, followed by a great war) in a little rivulet which comes down the cliff at Ecclesbourne, near Hastings, close to a cottage frequented at that time by Douglas Jerrold.", "They were wriggling up in the damp grass and overflow of the driblet 150 feet above the shore, a stone’s throw below.", "They must have come out of the sea, attracted by the tiny thread of fresh water entering it at this spot.", "The Danube and its tributary streams contain no eels, although the rivers which open into the Mediterranean are well stocked with them.", "This is supposed to be due to the fact that the Black Sea does not afford a suitable breeding ground, and that the way through the Dardanelles is closed to eels by some natural law, as it has been to warships by treaty.", "Probably, however, it will be found that the geological changes in the area of sea and land are intimately connected with the migrations of the eel, and that the eel is originally a marine fish which did not in remote ages travel far from the deep waters.", "Its gradually acquired habit of running up fresh waters to feed has led it step by step into a frequentation of certain rivers which have become (by changes of land and sea) inconveniently remote from its ancestral haunts.", "An interesting question is whether at the not very distant period when there was continuous land joining England to France and the Thames and the Rhine had a common mouth opening into the North Sea, eels existed in the area drained by those two rivers; and, if so, by what route did they pass as silver eels to the deep sea, and by what route did the new generations of young eels hatched in the deep sea travel to the Thames and Rhine.", "It seems most probable that in those days there were no eels in the Thames and other North Sea rivers.", "Our present knowledge of the romantic history of the common eel of our own rivers we owe in large part to the work done by the International Committee for the Investigation of the North Sea.", "Who would ever have imagined when he caught a wriggling eel, with a hook and worm thrown into a stagnant pool in the Midlands, that the muddy creature was some five or six years ago living as a glass like leaf shaped prodigy in the Atlantic depths, a hundred miles from Ireland?", "Who would have dreamed that it had come all that long journey by its own efforts, and would probably, if it had not been hooked, have wriggled one summer’s night out of the pond, across wet meadows, into a ditch, and so to the river, and back to the sea, and to the far away orgy in the dark salt waters of the ocean floor, to the consummation of its life and its strange, mysterious ending?", "There are two points of interest to be mentioned in regard to the rivers Danube and Thames in connection with eels.", "I have trustworthy reports of the very rare occurrence of eels in streams connected with the Danube.", "Since the young elvers do not ascend the Danube, where do these rare specimens come from?", "There can be no doubt that they have made their way individually into the Danube system by migration through canals or ditches from tributaries of the Rhine or the Elbe.", "A similar explanation has to be offered of the eels which at present inhabit the Thames.", "I cannot find any evidence of the existence to day of an eel fare—that is, a running up of elvers in the river Thames.", "Probably about the same time as the foul poisoning of the Thames water by London sewage and chemical works put an end to the ascent of the salmon (about the year 1830), the entrance of the myriad swarm of young eels in their annual procession from the sea also ceased.", "The elvers were caught and made into fish cakes in London before the nineteenth century, just as they are to day at Gloucester.", "It would be interesting to know exactly when they ceased to appear in the Thames.", "A curious fact, however, is that young eels—not so small as elvers, but from three inches in length upwards—are taken close above London even to day.", "Four years ago I obtained a number of this small size from Teddington.", "The question arises as to whether these specimens represent just a small number of elvers which have managed to swim through the foul water of London and emerge into the cleaner part of the river above.", "This is improbable.", "It is more likely that they have come into the Thames by travelling up other rivers such as the Avon—which are connected by cuttings with the Thames tributaries.", "But it certainly is remarkable that eels of only three inches in length—and therefore very young—should have managed to get not merely into the Thames (to the upper parts of which no doubt many thus travel and remain during growth), but actually down the Thames so far in the direction of its tidal water as is Teddington lock.", "The specimens from Teddington were placed by me in the Natural History Museum.", "X  MODERN HORSES AND THEIR ANCESTORS   The ever increasing development of motor traffic leads to speculation as to what is to be in the immediate future the fate of the horse.", "What is its history in the past?", "It is in nearly all cases a matter of great difficulty to trace the animals and plants which mankind has domesticated or cultivated to the original wild stock from which they have been derived.", "Lately we have gained new knowledge on the origin of the domesticated breeds of the horse.", "It is generally agreed that the Mongolian wild horse represents the chief stock from which the horses of Europe and those conveyed by Europeans to America were derived.", "This wild horse was formerly known as inhabiting the Kirghiz steppes, and was called the Tarpan.", "It became extinct there some seventy years ago.", "The natives of that district asserted that the pure breed was only to be met with farther East in the Gobi Desert of Central Asia.", "The Tarpan itself showed signs of mixed blood in having a mouse coloured coat, which is a sure indication amongst horses of cross breeding.", "Prevalsky, a Russian traveller, was the first to obtain specimens of the pure bred wild horse of the Gobi Desert, which still exists.", "Live specimens have been brought to Europe, and some are in the possession of the Duke of Bedford.", "A female is mounted and exhibited in the Natural History Museum, and also a skeleton and skulls.", "Prevalsky’s horse, or the Mongolian wild horse, is of small stature, standing about twelve hands at the shoulder.", "The root of the tail is short haired, the mane short and upright, without forelock.", "The body colour is yellow dun, the mane and tail black, as well as the lower part of the legs, and there is a dark stripe down the back.", "The muzzle in pure bred specimens is white.", "The head is relatively large and the muzzle thick and relatively short.", "A very decided character is shown by the great size and relative length of the row of cheek teeth, it being one third larger than the same row of teeth in a Dartmoor pony of the same stature.", "A very interesting fact, which goes a long way to establish the view that the European domesticated horse is derived from the Mongolian wild horse, comes to us in a most striking way from some of the most ancient records of the human race.", "In the South of France the contents of caves formerly inhabited by men have been dug out and examined with increasing care and accuracy of late years, though first investigated fifty years ago.", "Similar caves, though not so prolific of evidences of human occupation, have been explored in England (Kent’s Cavern at Torquay, and others).", "The astounding fact has now become quite clear that these caves were inhabited by men of no mean capacity from 50,000 to 250,000 years ago, when bone harpoons, flint knives, flint scrapers, and bone javelin throwers were the chief weapons in use, when these islands were solidly joined to the European continent, when a sheet of glacial ice, alternately retreating and extending, covered the whole of Northern Europe, and when the mammoth, rhinoceros, hyena, lion, bear, bison, great ox, horse, and later the reindeer, inhabited the land and were hunted, eaten, and utilised for their bone, tusks, and skin by these ancient men.", "I revert to this subject in a later article (page 371), but would merely say now that it is all as certain and well established a chapter in man’s history as that of the ancient Egyptians, who are really quite modern (dating from 8000 years at most) as compared with these cave men of 50,000 years ago, and the even earlier races which preceded them in Europe.", "The bones of the animals killed and eaten by the cave men are found in some cases in enormous quantities.", "In one locality in France the bones of as many as 80,000 horses (which had been cooked and eaten) have been dug up and counted!", "The most wonderful and extraordinary thing about these cave men is that they carved complete rounded sculptures, high reliefs, low reliefs, and line engravings on mammoth’s ivory, on reindeer horn, on bones, and on stones—the line engravings being the latest in date, as shown by their position in the deposits on the floor of the caves, which are often as much as twenty feet or thirty feet in thickness!", "Not only that, but these carvings are often real works of art, extremely well drawn, and showing not mere childish effort but work which was done with the intention and control of an artist’s mind.", "An immense number of these carvings are now known.", "I have before me one of the most recent publications on the subject—a series of plates showing the carvings collected from caves in the Pyrenees, the Dordogne, and the Landes by M. Piette, who recently died.", "I have examined his collection and others of the same kind in the great Museum of St.", "Germain, near Paris.", "We have in London some of the earlier collections, and especially that of the Vicomte de Lastic, to purchase which my old friend Sir Richard Owen journeyed to the Dordogne in the winter of 1864.", "Many animals, as well as some human beings (Fig.", "7), are represented in these carvings—the mammoth itself, carved on a piece of its own ivory, is among them, and a good many represent the horse (Fig.", "8).", "Now it is a fact that the carvings of the horses of that period undoubtedly represent a horse which is identical in proportions, shape of head, mane, and tail, with the wild Mongolian horse, and is unlike in those points to modern European horses, or to the Arabian horse.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "7.—Drawing (of the actual size of the original) of an ivory carving (fully rounded) of a female head.", "The specimen was found in the cavern of Brassempouy, in the Landes.", "It is of the earliest reindeer period, and the arrangement of the hair or cap is remarkable.]", "[Illustration  FIG.", "8.—Drawing (of the actual size of the original) of a fully rounded carving in reindeer’s antler of the head of a neighing horse.", "The head resembles that of the Mongolian horse.", "This is one of the most artistic of the cave men’s carvings yet discovered.", "It is of the Palæolithic age (early reindeer period), probably not less than fifty thousand years old.", "It was found in the cavern of Mas d’Azil, Ariège, France, and is now in the museum of St.", "Germain.]", "It was, until the discoveries of M. Piette, held that though the cave men killed, ate, and made pictures of the horse of those remote days, yet that they did not tame it, put a halter or a bridle on it, and make use of it.", "Some of the carvings figured by M. Piette leave, however, no room for doubt that the cave men fitted a bridle to the head and muzzle of the horse.", "These carvings (Fig.", "9) show a twisted thong placed round the nose and passing near the angle of the mouth where it is possible, though not certain, that a bit was inserted.", "Connected to this main encircling thong are four twisted cords (on each side of the head), which run horizontally backwards, and the two lower of these are joined by a flat, plate like piece, which is ornamented.", "The whole apparatus is further connected to a twisted cord on each side, which runs towards the back of the head, but it is not shown in the carving what becomes of it.", "Thus it seems clear not only that the cave men of these remote ages were wonderful artists, but that they mastered and muzzled the horse.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "9.—Drawing (of the actual size of the original) of a flat carving in shoulder bone, of a horse’s head, showing twisted rope bridle and trappings.", "_a_ appears to represent a flat ornamented band of wood or skin connecting the muzzling rope _b_ with other pieces _c_ and _d_.", "This specimen is from the cave of St.", "Michel d’Arudy, and is of the reindeer period.", "This, and others like it, are in the museum of St.", "Germain.]", "Some of the engravings of horses’ heads seem to indicate the existence of a horse alongside the commoner form with a narrower, more tapering face, and may possibly be due to the introduction, even at that remote period, of another race distinct from the Northern or Mongolian wild horse.", "That this admixture of a distinct and more slender horse with the Northern horse has taken place over and over again in historical times is a matter of knowledge.", "The question is, when did it first take place, and where did the more slender horse come from?", "In later days we know this more shapely breed as the Arab and the Barb, and the introduction of its blood at various times into the more Northern stock is well ascertained.", "The latest great historical case of such admixture is the production of the English thoroughbred in the eighteenth century by such sires as the Darley Arabian, the Godolphin Barb, and the Brierley Turk, whose blood is transmitted to modern racehorses through the great historic sires, Herod, Matchem, and Eclipse, the ancestors of practically all modern racehorses.", "The horse of more Southern origin thus recognised as distinct from the prehistoric European horse, it is now convenient to speak of as the Southern or Arabian horse.", "There are certain curious structural features which seem to mark these horses and their offspring, even when their strain is blended with that of the more Northern horse.", "Probably from the time of the cave men onward the selective breeding of horses has been carried on, so that in many breeds size has been vastly increased.", "It is an important fact that the English racehorse has never been selected and bred for points (as cattle and sheep are), but always by performance on the racecourse.", "Thus it becomes an extremely interesting matter to see what are the changes which the breeder of thoroughbred stock has unconsciously produced—what are the differences between the racehorse of to day and that of 50, 100, and 150 years ago.", "This was pointed out to me by the late Duke of Devonshire as a reason for supporting my proposal to secure and place in the Natural History Museum the skulls, limb bones, hoofs, and other indestructible parts of great racehorses (and of other breeds), and also for having very accurately measured reduced models made of such horses, in order that we may after some years compare the proportions and structure at present arrived at with the later developments which the continual selection of winner’s blood in breeding must unconsciously produce.", "Such a collection was started by me in the museum, but it needs the assistance of owners of horses—both as to placing record specimens in the museum and in paying for the preparation of accurately reduced models by competent artists.", "It already comprises the skulls of Stockwell, Bend Or, and Ormonde, and several carefully made reduced models of celebrated horses.", "There is no doubt that the English racehorse has increased in size.", "He is a bigger animal to day than he was 200 years ago, and the opinion of the best authorities is that he has increased on the average an inch in height at the withers in every twenty five years.", "The racehorse has a much longer thigh bone and upper arm bone (in proportion to the rest of the leg) than has the cart horse, and it is probable that this length has been continually increased by the selection of winners for breeding.", "There are other points of scientific interest as to modern horses and their forefathers which are illustrated by valuable specimens and preparations placed by me in the Natural History Museum.", "All those hairy warm blooded quadrupeds which suckle their young, and are hence called mammals, are the descendants of small five toed ancestors about the size of a spaniel.", "This is equally true of the elephant, the gorilla, the horse, and the ox.", "In the sands and clays deposited since the time of the chalk sea, the remains (bones and teeth) of the ancestors of living mammals are found in great abundance.", "These sands and clays are called the Tertiaries, and are divided into lower, middle, and upper—whilst we recognise as Post Tertiaries (or Quaternary) the later formed gravel and cave deposits in which the remains and weapons of the cave men have been found.", "The Tertiaries consist of a series of deposits amounting to about 3000 feet in thickness, and they have taken several million years in depositing—no one can say how many.", "[Illustration  HIPPARION HORSE  FIG.", "10.—To the left, the fore foot of the horse ancestor, Hipparion, showing three toes  to the right, the back view of a long bone of a modern horse’s foot, with rudiments of outer toes, called splint bones.]", "In the upper Tertiary we find the remains of a kind of horse (the Hipparion), with well developed petti toes (like those of a pig) on each side of the big central toe (Fig.", "10).", "In the middle Tertiary we find smaller ancestral horses, with three toes of nearly equal size, and in the lower Tertiary a horse ancestor as small as a fox hound (the Hyracotherium), with four toes on its front foot and three on its hind foot.", "Coming very close to this in general character is another small extinct animal of the same age, with five toes on each foot.", "As the toes have dwindled in number and size, leaving at last only the big central toe (as we pass upward from the small ancestors to the big modern horse), so the cheek teeth, too, have changed.", "At first they had shallow crowns and divided fangs, and showed four prominences on the crown which were little, if at all, worn down during life.", "But as the horse became a bigger animal and took to eating coarse tooth wearing grass, his teeth became deeper, and continued to grow for a long time, whilst the crown was rubbed down by the hard food, and a curiously complex pattern was brought into view by the exposure of the irregular bosses of the crown in cross section.", "And, meanwhile, the size and proportions of the horse ancestors changed until, after being pig like, then tapir like, they acquired the perfect form and size for fleet and prolonged movement over firm, grass grown plains.", "Horses and other large animals have to run, not only to escape pursuit by carnivorous enemies, but in order to travel, before they die from thirst, from a region suddenly dried up by drought to a region where water can be had.", "Many thousands of wild animals perish every year from local droughts in Africa.", "No small animals can exist in regions liable to be affected by sudden drought.", "Three toed horses, like the upper Tertiary Hipparion, are occasionally born as monstrosities from ordinary horses at the present day.", "All horses have the remnant of a toe on each side of the big central toe—in the form of splint bones—concealed beneath the skin.", "In some breeds, for instance, in the Shire horses, which have enormous hairy feet in proportion to their huge strength and weight, these splint bones tend to develop three little toe joints, which are immovable, but obviously are petti toes. It is related by Suetonius that Julius Cæsar used to ride a favourite horse which had several toes on each foot with claws like a lion.", "This was one of the monstrosities alluded to above, a throw back to the ancestral many toed condition.", "Specimens illustrating these, and all else which I am here relating concerning horses, and much more which I have not space to tell, may be seen in the North Hall of the Natural History Museum.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "11.—Skulls of horses and of deer to show the pre orbital pit or cups _pf_, and its absence in the Mongolian (Prevalsky’s) horse.]", "The three toed ancestral horse, Hipparion, attained a fair size (that of a big donkey), and was shaped like the recent fleet one toed horses.", "In the skull in front of the orbit, the Hipparion has a strongly marked depression in the bone, as long and broad as a hen’s egg, and in shape like one half of an egg cut through longwise (see Fig.", "11 _pf_).", "These pre orbital cavities are known in deer, sheep, and antelopes; they lodge a gland resembling the tear gland, which has, itself, a separate existence.", "Similar glands are found in the feet and ankle joints of sheep and deer.", "The fluid which they secrete probably has an odour (not readily noticed by man) which helps to keep the herd together, or, on certain tracks when the fluid is smeared on to herbage.", "It is a remarkable fact that the skulls of the wild Mongolian horse and of the fossil horse of the cave men, as also those of the commoner European breeds, have no trace of this pre orbital cup or of the gland which Hipparion, their three toed ancestor, possessed.", "Nor, indeed, have the asses and zebras.", "But the Southern horse, the Arab, and all the breeds into which his blood has prominently entered—as, for instance, the English racer (so called thoroughbred) and the Shire horse (which is derived from the old English war horse, in the making of which certainly four hundred years ago Arab blood and heavy Northern stock were mingled), do show, as a rule, a well marked if shallow, cup like depression in front of the orbit!", "In fact, as Mr.", "Lydekker has pointed out, the presence of this pre orbital cup is evidence of the descent of its possessor from Arab ancestry.", "Many specimens of horses’ skulls showing this cup are exhibited in the Natural History Museum.", "We have not been able to find any trace of a gland like the larmier of deer and the crumen of antelopes on examining the soft tissues which overlie this cavity in horses of Arab descent, but it is not improbable that occasional instances of such survival will some day come to light.", "A very interesting fact in connection with this concavity and its indication of a distinction between the Northern (Mongolian) and the Southern (Arabian) horse is that in India a fossil horse of very late Tertiary date has been found, a true one toed horse, not a Hipparion, which has the pre orbital cup well marked, and is possibly the ancestor of the Arab.", "There is no very great difference between the wild horse and wild asses and zebras.", "They are distinct species, but will breed together and produce mules, which in rare cases appear to be themselves fertile, although this is doubtful.", "The inner causes of the infertility of mules are not really known or understood.", "Nor, in fact, do we know really and experimentally what are the causes of fecundity and of infecundity in normally paired animals, including mankind.", "It is of the utmost importance to modern Statecraft that this subject should be studied, and there is a great field for experimental inquiry.", "A clear mark of difference between the horse and the other species of the genus Equus (namely, the Asiatic and African asses and the zebras) is found in the curious wart like knobs[1] on the legs, which are called chestnuts.

XI  A RIVAL OF THE FABLED UPAS TREE   We are so accustomed nowadays to danger to life and health from minute, invisible germs, and to exerting all our skill in order to destroy them, that the knowledge of the existence of large and beautiful trees in our midst which can, and do, cause terrible disease and suffering by their mere presence, comes as a shock, and produces a peculiar sense of insecurity greater even than that excited by unseen micro organisms.", "For the trees of which I am about to speak are cultivated in our gardens, trained up against the walls of our houses with loving care, and admired for the beautiful autumn tints of their leaves.", "Yet it is now certain that they are the cause in many persons of most terrible suffering and illness.", "I am glad to be able to warn my readers in regard to these plants, and I shall be very much interested to hear whether the information which I am about to give proves to be of value in any particular case.", "A married couple, friends of my own, went to live, about fourteen years ago, in a newly built, detached house, standing in its own garden, in the neighbourhood of an English city.", "After they had been there two years the lady developed a very painful eruption or eczema on the face, which, in the course of a few weeks, caused the eyes, nose, and lips to swell to an extraordinary degree, accompanied by the formation of blisters and breaking of the skin.", "The affection spread to the body, and caused constant pain and corresponding prostration.", "Her medical attendants were unable either to cure or to account for her condition.", "After some months she left home, and entirely recovered.", "But every year the same distressing and disfiguring illness attacked her (commencing in the month of June), and disappeared as soon as she left her house, only to return when she came back to it.", "The doctors spoke of her affliction as a mysterious form of erysipelas, and even suggested blood poisoning as the cause.", "For long periods she was so ill and in so much pain that she was unable to see her friends, and her life was at times in danger.", "Two years ago a weekly newspaper published an account, written by a correspondent, of an illness from which he had suffered—exactly agreeing with that which had for so many years tortured my friend’s wife.", "This writer stated that he had ascertained that the disease was due to the action of a poison given off by a creeper which grew on the walls of his house.", "He had supposed this plant to be a Virginian creeper; but he had discovered that it was in reality the Californian poison vine called by botanists _Rhus toxicodendron_.", "The terribly poisonous nature of this plant is well known to the people of the United States.", "It is one of the sumach trees, of which other poisonous kinds are known, whilst more than one species is used (especially in Japan) for preparing a resinous varnish which is used in the manufacture of lacquered articles.", "The writer in the weekly paper stated that he had cut down and burnt the poison vine which grew on the walls of his house, and that his sufferings had ceased.", "My friend happened to read this account, and immediately examined his own house.", "He found a creeper resembling a Virginian creeper, but having three leaflets or divisions of the leaf instead of five, growing around his drawing room window, and actually spreading its branches and leaves over the window of his wife’s bedroom.", "He sent specimens of the creeper to Kew, where it was at once identified as the _Rhus toxicodendron_ or American poison vine or poison ivy.", "He caused the plant to be removed and burnt, and, except for a slight attack in July, due no doubt to fragments of the leaves still carried about in the form of dust, his wife has recovered her health.", "I have looked into this matter with care, and I find that (presumably in ignorance) nurserymen in England have sold specimens of the poison vine for planting as creepers, under the name _Ampelopsis Hoggii_.", "The smaller leaved Virginian creeper, with self attaching tendrils, is known as _Ampelopsis Veitchii_, and is, like the larger Virginian creeper (_A.", "quinquefoliata_), quite harmless.", "The poison vine is not an Ampelopsis at all, not even one of the Vitaceæ or vine family, as that genus is.", "It is a Sumach or Rhus, and belongs to a distinct family, the Terebinthaceæ.", "It has a three split leaf, not five leaflets, as has the large Virginian creeper, nor a small three pointed leaf, as has the _Ampelopsis Veitchii_.", "The _Veitchii_ frequently has the leaf also split into three leaflets, but the stalk of the middle leaflet is not relatively so long as it is in the poison vine.", "The differences and resemblances in the leaves of these plants are shown in the accompanying illustration (Fig.", "14), which has been prepared from actual specimens for this book.", "The people of the United States are on their guard against this plant, knowing its terrible properties.", "Sir William Thiselton Dyer, formerly director of Kew Gardens, tells me that specimens of the American poison vine are grown in the garden at Kew, and that he has been present when American visitors (ladies) literally screamed with horror on seeing it, and ran from it as from a mad dog.", "Several cases are on record of the mysterious poisoning produced by this plant in England; but it is strangely unfamiliar to medical practitioners—indeed, practically unknown to them, although I have ascertained that many English people, especially ladies, have been victims for some years to its unsuspected influence.", "At the University of Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, they have made quite recently a thorough examination of the poison vine in the laboratory, with the following results  The poison is an oil—a fixed oil, not a volatile one, as we might have imagined from its mysterious action at a distance.", "The oil exists in all parts of the plant, even in the fine hairs and cuticle of the leaf.", "It can be extracted by means of ether, and is one of the most virulent irritants known, having a very curious penetrating and persistent action, and producing violent pain and destruction of tissue when placed on the skin in quantity so minute (one thousandth of a milligram in two drops of olive oil) as to be beyond the terms of everyday language.", "It seems to be usually brought to the eyes, nose, lips, and skin of the face and body by the fingers which have touched a leaf or fragments of a leaf in powder.", "The dead leaf in winter still retains the oil, and minute dust like particles can carry it.", "The treatment for it is washing with soap, oil, and ether at an early stage of the attack—especial care being taken to free the fingers from any minute traces of the oil adhering to them.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "14.—Drawings, about half the natural size, of the leaves of the common quinquefoliate Virginian creeper (1 and 2), of the adherent Ampelopsis Veitchii (3 and 4), and of the poison vine, _Rhus toxicodendron_ (5 and 6).", "From specimens in the Botanical Department of the Natural History Museum.", "Note especially the greater length of the stalk of the central leaflet in the poison vine.", "Note also that the common Virginian creeper has sometimes only three leaflets (2) instead of five, and that Veitchii has either three leaflets, as in 3, or has the leaflets united into one three pointed leaf, as in 4.]", "The poison of the poison vine only acts upon a limited number of individuals, many people being perfectly immune.", "At the same time, the effect upon susceptible people appears to be enhanced with every fresh attack; even after the total removal of the poison vine and its dust from proximity to a susceptible person, he or she is apt for some time—owing to the retention of some trace of the oil in the skin or clothes—to have slight attacks.", "According to a writer who two years ago gave in the _Spectator_ an account of his own case, the first symptom of an attack is almost invariably a redness and irritation of the eyelids, accompanied by shivering.", "In a few hours the eyelids are closed, the features unrecognisable, and the skin covered with little blisters.", "Then the lips swell enormously, the glands of the neck also.", "In four days the arms and hands are reached, each finger appearing as if terribly scalded and requiring separate bandaging.", "Then sometimes the lower limbs are involved.", "After ten days the attack passes off, leaving the patient in a pitiable state of weakness to grow a new skin and recover from other painful results of the poisoning.", "But no immunity is conferred by an attack; the unhappy victim (who is ignorant of the cause of his sufferings) may, and frequently does, get a new dose of the poison as soon as he has recovered, and the whole course of the illness has again to be passed through.", "If this account should fall into the hands of any one who is being unwittingly poisoned by the American poison vine, and may therefore be saved by what I have written from further suffering, I shall be greatly pleased.", "There are very few plants which have a power of diffusing poison around them; usually it is necessary to touch or to eat portions of a plant before it can exert any poisonous effect.", "The eighteenth century story of the upas tree of Java, which was fabled to fill a whole valley with its poisonous emanation, and to cause the death of animals and birds at a distance of fifteen miles, is now known to be a romantic invention.", "The tree in question is merely one having a poisonous juice which was extracted and used by the wilder races of Java as an arrow poison.", "It is stated that one of the stinging nettles of tropical India has such virulent poison and such an abundance of it in the hairs on its surface, that explorers have been injured by merely approaching it, the detached hairs probably floating in the air and getting into the eyes, nose, and throat of any one coming near it.", "The poison of the poisonous stings of both plants and of animals has been to some extent examined of late years.", "It is a curious fact that there are proportionately few plants which sting as compared with the number and variety of animals which do so.", "On the other hand, there are an enormous number of plants which are poisonous to man when eaten by him, but there are very few animals which are so.", "It will be of interest to my readers to know that I received, in consequence of the publication of the foregoing account of the Poison vine or Poison ivy, more than fifty letters and boxes containing leaves.", "At Kew Gardens nearly a hundred applications were made with a request for the identification of leaves.", "The proportion of cases in which leaves of true poison ivy (_Rhus toxicodendron_) were sent to me seems to be the same as that which they observed at Kew—only two samples of the leaves sent to me were those of the true poison ivy.", "Hence we may conclude that the plant has not been very largely introduced in this country, and probably there are not many hundred cases existing in England of the painful malady which it can, in certain people, produce.", "I have, however, received information of several instances of this poisoning from different parts of the country, which are either now under treatment or have been cured, and in some cases the poison ivy has been discovered as the cause, owing to the description which I published.", "It is certainly true that the illness caused by this plant only attacks a small proportion of those who handle it, and it is possible that the plant is more virulent at some seasons and in some soils than in others.", "In the United States, even in the neighbourhood of New York, it is a real danger, and is recognised as such, but as appears from a letter which I quote below, the reason of the dread which the poison ivy excites in the States depends on the fact that it is not there a mere garden plant, but grows wild in great abundance in the woodlands frequented by holiday makers and lovers of natural forest and lakeside wilderness.", "The poisonous nature of the allied species of _Rhus_ used for the manufacture of lacquer or varnish is recognised by the Japanese and others who prepare this product and have to handle the plant—they wear gloves to protect the hands.", "As showing what kind of trouble the poison ivy and poison oak (another kind of _Rhus_ or _Sumach_) give in the United States, I will quote a letter I have received from an American lady well known in London society.", "She says  I have known, suffered, and struggled against the poison ivy in America from my earliest years, when my poor mother lay for days with blinded and swollen eyes, having gathered it inadvertently.", "The ‘poison ivy,’ as we call it, is a curse to country life, outside the purely artificial and cultivated gardens, and even there it creeps in insidiously. She describes a beautiful farm property on Lake Champlain, on the Canadian border, where she and her family would spend many weeks in summer in order to enjoy the delights of complete seclusion in wild, unspoilt country  The one and only drawback to the place was, she writes, the inexhaustible quantity of poison ivy.", "Our first duty had been to teach my two daughters and their governess how to distinguish and avoid contact with it.", "The one and only rule was that the poison ivy has the clusters of three leaflets (the middle leaflet with a longer stalk, _E.R.L._), whereas the woodbine (not the English woodbine, which is a convolvulus, _E.R.L._), or, as you call it, ‘Virginian creeper,’ has five leaflets in a cluster.", "Every path which we used frequently and necessarily, such as the path to the boat house, and to the cove where the bathing house stood, we kept cleared of the _Rhus_ for a sufficient width, but in the woods eternal vigilance was the price of safety.", "To uproot and burn is the only way to destroy it, but, of course, that involves danger to the one who does the work, because contact with the spade used, and with the garments which touched the ivy, might communicate the poison.", "The farmer and the countryfolk about declared that the fumes from the burning plant could and did poison those who breathed them.", "We used to turn a flock of sheep into the most used parts.", "They prefer the poison ivy to grass, and greedily eat down every leaf within reach in hedge or path.", "But that, of course, was a mere temporary safety, as the plant is most tenacious of life.", "I personally had a most grievous experience one summer.", "I can only suppose that my dress, though very short for wood and hill walking, brushed over the poisonous plant, and then, when I undressed, came into contact with my skin.", "Both legs became covered with the eruption, eventually developing pustules, and the agony of itching, burning, and smarting was indescribable.", "The first remedy applied is usually a frequent use of baths of some alkali, generally common soda.", "With me it was altogether inadequate, and the doctor carefully covered the affected parts with a thick layer of bismuth, and bandaged them, so as to exclude all air.", "But it took weeks to cure me.", "A very serious result in many cases is that there is a recurrence of the itching for several years.     XII  POISONS AND STINGS OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS   To give an account of poisonous plants would require a whole volume.", "Among plants of every degree and kind are many which produce special chemical substances which are more or less poisonous, and yet often of the greatest value to man when used in appropriate doses, though injurious and even deadly if swallowed in large quantity.", "Plants are laboratories which build up in a thousand varieties wonderful chemical bodies, some crystalline, some oils, some volatile (as perfumes and aromatic substances), some brilliantly coloured (used as dyes), some pungent, some antiseptic, some of the greatest value as food, and some even digestive, similar to or identical with those formed in the stomach of an animal.", "Man, the chemist, every year is learning how to produce in his own laboratories, from coal and wood refuse, many of these bodies, so as to become to an ever increasing extent independent of the somewhat capricious and costly services of the chemists supplied by nature—the plants.", "In a recent exhibition there was a case showing on one side the various essential oils used to make up a flask of eau de Cologne, and specimens of the plants, flowers, leaves, and fruits from which they are distilled.", "On the other side of the case was a series of bottles showing the steps in the process by which the modern chemist manufactures from coal tar and coker butter the same bodies which give value to the vegetable extracts, and there was finally a bottle of what is called synthetic eau de Cologne—that is, eau de Cologne put together from the products manufactured by the human, instead of the vegetable, chemist.", "Whilst man has learnt to avoid swallowing poisonous plants, although occasionally blundering over pretty looking berries and deceptive mushrooms, he has had little to fear in that way from animals.", "To a small degree this is due to the fact that only parts of animals are eaten by man, and those very generally are cooked before being eaten, the heating often sufficing to destroy substances present in flesh, fish, and fowl which would be poisonous if taken raw.", "But, as a matter of fact, animals do not generally protect themselves from being eaten, as plants largely do, by developing nasty or poisonous substances in their flesh, though some do.", "They fight rather by claws, teeth, and poison glands therewith connected, or else escape by extra quick locomotion, a method not possible to plants.", "Many insects (butterflies, beetles, and bugs), however, produce nasty aromatic substances which cause animals like birds and lizards to reject them as food.", "The toad and the salamander both produce a very deadly poison in their damp, soft skins, which causes any animal to drop them from its mouth, and to regret bitterly the attempt to swallow them.", "The frog has no such poison in its skin, but can jump out of harm’s way.", "The strong yellow and black marking of the European salamander is what is called a warning coloration, just as is the yellow and black outfit of the poisonous wasp.", "Animals learn to leave the yellow and black livery untouched, and the creatures so marked escape the injury which would be caused them by tentative bites.", "There is a curious variation as to susceptibility on the part of man to poison in the flesh of fishes and shell fishes when taken by him as food.", "The word idiosyncrasy is applied to such individual susceptibility, and is, of course, applicable to the susceptibility shown by some persons to the poison of the American poison vine, described in the last article, and of others to acute inflammation from the dust of hayfields.", "Some persons cannot eat lobster, crab, or oysters or mussels without being poisoned in a varying degree by certain substances present in those shell fish even when cooked.", "Often a rash is caused on the skin, and colic.", "Others, again, cannot eat any fish of any kind without being poisoned in a similar way, or possibly are only liable to be poisoned by grey mullet or by mackerel.", "The most curious cases of this individual variability are found in the rash and fever caused by the vegetable drug quinine in rare instances, and the violent excitement produced in some persons by the usually soporific laudanum.", "All such cases have very great interest as showing us what a small difference separates an agreeable flavour or a valuable medicine from a rank poison, and how readily the chemical susceptibility of a complex organism like man may vary between toleration and deathly response, without any concomitant indication of such difference being apparent (in our present state of knowledge), in two individuals, to one of whom that is poison which to the other is meat.", "They also furnish a parallel to that marvellous conversion of toxin into anti toxin, in consequence of which the blood of an animal injected with small, increasing doses of deadly snake poison or diphtheria poison becomes an antidote to the same poison taken into the blood of an unprepared animal.", "There is, over and above these special cases of fish foods which are tolerated by some and are poison to others, a whole series of fishes which cannot be eaten by any one without serious poisoning being the result, even when the fish are carefully cooked.", "Happily, these fishes are rarely, if ever, caught on our own coasts.", "They produce, when even small bits are eaten, violent irritation of the intestine, and death, the symptoms resembling in many respects those of cholera.", "The curious bright coloured, beaked fish of tropical seas and coral reefs, with two or four large front teeth and spherical spine covered bodies, and the trigger fish of the same regions, are the chief of these poisonous fish.", "But there is a true anchovy on the coast of Japan, and a small herring in the West Indies, and a goby on the Indian coast (Pondicherry), all of which are deadly poison even when cooked; and there are many others.", "So one has to be careful about fish eating in the remoter parts of the world.", "The poisons of these fish with poisonous flesh have not been carefully studied, but they seem to resemble chemically the poisons produced by certain putrefactive microbes.", "Let us now revert to the more special subject of poisonous stings.", "Every one knows that although it is unpleasant to be pricked by the little spines on the leaf of a thistle, it is not the same unpleasantness as being stung by a nettle.", "There is no poison in the thistle.", "The hairs which beset the leaves of the common nettle are firm, but brittle and hollow; they break off in the skin, and a poison exudes from their interior.", "Under the microscope—and it is quite easy to examine it with a high power—the hollow nettle hair is seen to be partly occupied by living protoplasm—a transparent, viscid substance which shows an active streaming movement, and has embedded in it a dense kernel or nucleus (see Fig.", "15 _bis_).", "It is, in fact, a living cell, or life unit.", "The space in the cell not occupied by protoplasm is filled with clear liquid, which contains the poison.", "This has been examined chemically by using a large quantity of nettle hairs, and is found to contain formic acid—the same irritating acid which is secreted by ants when they sting, whence its name.", "But later observations show that the juice of the nettle hair contains also a special poison in minute quantities, an albuminous substance,

It is a curious fact, mentioned by a well known writer, Mrs.", "Jameson, that the bones of a great fossil reptile were preserved and exhibited at Aix in France as the bones of the dragon slain by St.", "Michael, just as the bones of a whale are shown as those of the mythical Dun cow of Warwick in that city.", "There are three very good reasons for not entertaining the suggestion that the tradition of the dragon and similar beasts is due to human co existence with the great reptiles of the past.", "The first is that the age of the rocks known as cretaceous and jurassic (or oölitic), in which are found the more or less complete skeletons of the great saurians—many bigger in the body than elephants, and with huge tails in addition, iguanodon, megalosaurus, diplodocus, as well as the winged pterodactyles (see Plate II., where a representation is given of what we know as to the form and bearing of two species of pterodactyle) and a vast series of such creatures—is so enormously remote that not only man but all the hairy warm blooded animals like him, did not come into existence until many millions of years after these rocks had been deposited by water and the great reptiles buried in them had become extinct.", "The cave men of the Pleistocene period are modern, even close to us, as compared with the age when the great saurians flourished.", "That was just before the time when our chalk cliffs were being formed as a slowly growing sediment on the floor of a deep sea.", "No accurate measure of the time which has elapsed since then is possible, but we find that about 200 ft.", "thickness of deposit has been accumulated since the date of the earliest human remains known to us—whilst over 5000 ft.", "have accumulated since the chalk began to be deposited, and the great saurians ceased to exist.", "If we reckon, in accordance with the most moderate estimate, a quarter of a million years for the upper 200 ft.", "of deposit or human period (Pleistocene), we must suppose that twenty or thirty times as long a period has elapsed to allow time for the deposit of the 5000 ft.", "of sand and rock since the great saurians ceased to exist.", "This would be some six or seven million years—a long while for tradition to run, even supposing man existed all that time, which he did not.", "And the probability is that this estimate of the time is far too small  a hundred million years is nearer the truth.", "[Illustration  _PLATE II_  REAL DRAGONS  THE EXTINCT FLYING REPTILES KNOWN AS PTERODACTYLES.", "THEIR BONES AND WING MEMBRANES ARE PRESERVED IN THE

intelligent creature, capable of handing on a tradition, as much as half a million or even a million years before the date of the remains of the earliest cave men discovered in Europe, we yet get no long way down the avenue of past time.", "Man would still be separated by millions of years and long ages of change and development of the forms of animal life on the earth’s surface, from the period of the great reptiles or saurians who flourished before the chalk was deposited.", "And there is good evidence that none of those great saurians survived the date of the chalk.", "They died out and their place was taken by the earliest ancestors of elephants, rhinoceroses, horses, cattle, lions, and monkeys, from which in the course of ages the animals we know by those names were developed, whilst very late in the history man was produced.", "The reptiles continued as small, furtive creatures—the lizards and a few biggish snakes and crocodiles—but no descendants of the great Dinosaurs survived.", "Another reason against the supposed survival of a real tradition of dragons is that, even in regard to much later—immensely later—creatures, such as the mammoth or hairy elephant, which we know was contemporary with man, there is no real tradition.", "The natives of the sub arctic regions in which the skeletons and whole carcases of the mammoth are found in a frozen state, and from whence many hundreds of tusks of the mammoth have been since the earliest times yearly exported and used in Europe as ivory, have no tradition of these creatures.", "They have fanciful stories about the ghosts of the mammoths, but they call their tusks horns, and have no legends of the monster as a living thing.", "The use of mammoth’s ivory in Northern Europe dates back for a thousand years historically, and probably has never ceased since the days of the cave men.", "Three years ago I examined the richly carved drinking horn of a Scandinavian hero, dating from the tenth century, and preserved amongst the treasures of York Minster, and I have little doubt that it is fashioned from the tusk of a mammoth.", "A third reason for rejecting any connection of the dragon with a real reminiscence of the great extinct saurians is that its origin and its gradual building up in human fancy can be traced in the same way as that of many other fanciful and legendary creatures by reference to the regular operation of the imagination in successive ages of mankind.", "All races of men have imagined monsters by combining into one several parts of different animals.", "The centaur of the Greeks is a blend of man and horse, the great divine chimera of the Greeks was a two headed blend of lion and goat, and any such mixed creature is technically called nowadays a chimera.", "The

movable tiles or frames from one region to another for the purpose of encouraging their growth and avoiding a variety of dangers to their life and health (sometimes from the Bay of Biscay to the mouth of the Thames!).", "They are often—but not always—finally fed up in sea ponds or inlets, which are peculiar in containing an enormous number of those very minute microscopic plants, with beautifully shaped siliceous shells, which are known as diatoms.", "These are so abundant in such ponds as to form a sort of powder or cloud near the bottom, and the oysters draw them, day and night, by their gill currents into their mouths, digest them, and grow fine and fat.", "The district of Marennes, on the west coast of France, is celebrated for having sea ponds or tanks in which a wonderful diatom of a bright blue colour abounds; so abundant are they that the cloud produced by them in the pools is of a deep cobalt blue.", "When oysters are placed in these tanks to fatten, their gills or beards become rich blue green in colour.", "They lose the colour after ten days, when removed to ordinary tanks.", "These are the celebrated green oysters or Marennes vertes of French restaurants.", "The colouring matter of the little diatoms—swallowed by the million and digested—is taken up by the blood of the oyster from its stomach, and is excreted by certain corpuscles on the surface of the gills—as I showed some twenty five years ago—just as red madder is deposited in the bones of a pig fed upon madder, and as the feathers of the canary take up the colour of cayenne pepper when it is mixed with the canary’s food.", "It used to be thought that the green colour of the green oyster is due to copper—and that opinion was supported by the curious fact that the blood of all oysters and other molluscs, and also of lobsters, scorpions, and king crabs, does really contain a minute quantity of copper, just as our blood contains iron!", "It was also supported by the fact that occasionally a fraudulent fishmonger, when asked to supply green oysters, has been convicted of colouring the beards of ordinary oysters with green copper salt, so as to imitate the real article!", "The real history of the green bearded oysters is now quite certain, and any one interested in the matter should look at the coloured pictures of the beautiful little blue coloured _Navicula

Portuguese oyster have to pay for it.", "The female produces in one season not a million eggs, as does the common oyster, but nine millions.", "And out of every fifty million so produced (in some five or six years) only a single male and a single female individual, taking the whole oyster population of these species into consideration, survive to maturity.", "This enormous excess of egg production in order to ensure the survival of a single pair to replace their parents is a very frequent thing in aquatic animals.", "But there are many devices by which the necessity for such lavish scattering of a new brood is avoided.", "The common oyster is already a step in advance of the American in this matter, since it protects its young in the very earliest stages within the shelter of its shell.", "A further advance in this direction is found in the fresh water mussels (not to be confused with the very different sea mussels, since they are bitter and tough, and quite inedible, though used as bait in sea fishing).", "The pond mussel (_Anodon_) and the river mussel (_Unio_) are of distinct sexes, and the gills of the female become swollen up at the breeding season so as to form two large bags, into which the eggs are laid by her, as many as 500,000 in number.", "They are fertilised by the sperm filaments discharged by the males, which are carried into the female’s shell by currents produced by the vibrating hairs on the gills, as in the common oyster.", "But the young remain much longer in the mussel’s gills than do the young oysters in those of their parent’s.", "Late in the season you find the bag like gills of the female pond  and river mussels full of extraordinary little creatures one thirtieth of an inch long, each provided with a pair of triangular shells.", "They are discharged into the water, and swim very actively by rapidly opening and shutting the little shells (Fig.", "35).", "The common scallop (_Pecten_, or Pilgrim’s shell) swims every now and then in the same way as do these young mussels, and so do some other bivalves.", "The young fresh water mussels produce a long, sticky thread, which trails from the shell (Fig.", "35 _by_).", "Very few have the good chance to get further on in life than this stage, for all depends on their stumbling across fish—a stickleback, or a perch, or a pike—as they blindly snap their shells and wobble through the water.", "The lucky triangular mite whose sticky thread happens to touch a fish’s body becomes immediately fastened by it to the fish and then grips the skin with its snapping shells, the edges of which are provided with a few long, sharp teeth.", "The fish probably is quite unaware of the lodgment of the young mussel on its skin, but there it remains, and gets buried for a time in the soft tissues of the fish, becoming thus actually a parasite for some two or three months during the winter season.", "It nourishes itself on the juices of the fish, and grows to the size of a pin’s head, whilst it is carried away from its birthplace by the peregrinations of its host, the fish.", "Its shell now ceases to be triangular, and becomes like that of its parents.", "Eventually the young mussel drops off the fish and rests on the muddy bottom of pond or river, where it remains for many years, growing vastly in size, and barely moving during its long life from the spot where it fell.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "35.—Young of the pond mussel after escaping from the maternal gill pouch  A, as it escapes, swimming by opening and shutting the shells; _sh_, shell of one side; _al_, shell muscle; _t_, teeth of the shell’s edge; _by_, adhesive filament.", "B, after it has fixed to a fish; _mt_, mantle; _f_, muscular foot; _br_, gill processes; _pad_, _aad_, _al_, muscles; _auv_, heart.", "(From drawings by the late Frank Balfour.)]", "A beautiful little bivalve common in weedy streams in England is known as _Cyclas_ (it has no English name); it has a pair of shells shaped like those of a cockle, but smooth, and only half as big as one’s little finger nail.", "The nursing of the young in the gill sacs is carried to a much further point by _Cyclas_ than by the pond  or river mussel.", "Before they are ejected by the parent they are quite large—like their parent in appearance, and half as big as a hemp seed.", "Necessarily there are not many produced in a season—there is not room for more than twenty or thirty young in the gill sacs.", "XVI  THE HEART’S BEAT   The beat of the heart is one of those great and elemental features of man’s life which, in spite of our familiarity with it and its momentary recurrence, never loses its quality of mystery and isolation.", "The ceaseless accompaniment to our lives which the heart is always beating, like the inexorable stroke of an unseen pendulum, fills even the stoutest and bravest at times with a sense of awe.", "It seems now and then as though an independent living thing were in our breasts, and when it quickens and struggles, as it were, with its work, or languishes and hesitates in its efforts we have a sense of helpless domination by an existence—a living thing—over whose vagaries we have no control.", "The heart of man is no special endowment of the human race, nor even of the higher animals.", "As I mentioned a few pages back, the oyster and other shell fish have a heart which keeps time and beats the seconds for their uneventful lives, as does that of man for his more varied career.", "Not only the molluscs, but the insects, the spiders, the crabs, lobsters, and shrimps, and even the worms, have each a rhythmically beating heart.", "In all of them the significance of this heart and its beat are the same—it is driving the nourishing, oxygen carrying blood through the great vessels (arteries), which branch from it like a tree into the living tissues of the body, whence it returns by other vessels (the veins) back to the heart.", "In man and the warm blooded quadrupeds, in birds, reptiles, and fishes, the blood is of a splendid red colour, and the transparent vessels can be easily traced in their graceful ramifications and intricate networks, in consequence of the red blood showing through their walls.", "The red colour is due to a peculiar body, which can be easily separated from the blood as crystals.", "It has the special duty of carrying oxygen gas dissolved and attached to it; and of giving up that essential element to cause slow burning or oxydation in all parts of the body whilst taking up fresh supplies of oxygen on its passage through the lungs or the gills.", "In many of the lower animals (for instance, the oyster) the blood is devoid of this red crystalline substance (which, by the bye, is called hæmoglobin), and accordingly we cannot easily catch sight either of the heart or the blood vessels (see, however, Fig.", "30).", "But in shell fish the blood has a very pale blue tint, and this colour is due to a substance like hæmoglobin, which also can be crystallised, and is the oxygen carrier.", "Some sea worms have a green substance of a similar nature dissolved in their blood, and one can trace their blood vessels as a beautiful green network.", "A good many worms, for instance the common earth worm and the leeches (a discovery made by Cuvier, and referred to by him on his deathbed), and many sea worms have deep red coloured blood, due to the presence of the same crystalline substance which we find in man’s blood.", "And even a snail, common in the ponds at Hampstead and such places—the flat coiled snail known as _Planorbis_—has blood of a fine crimson colour, due to the presence of the same red oxygen carrier, as an exception to the colourless or pale blue blood found in most shell fish.", "Perhaps if oysters, too, had red blood, there would be a prejudice against eating them in the uncooked condition.", "The heart is essentially an enlargement of the great stem or main blood vessel which, like the trunk of a tree, has branching roots at one end of it and ordinary branches at the other.", "The trunk branches, and roots of the heart tree are, of course, hollow blood holding tubes, not solid fibrous structures, as are the woody branches and trunk of a vegetable tree.", "Further, the finest rootlets and the finest terminal branches in the case of the heart tree are connected to one another by the network of very fine branches or by great blood holding cavities, which occupy all parts of the body of an animal.", "The enlarged part of the trunk of the tree like system of blood vessels—the heart—has powerful muscles forming its walls, the fibres disposed so as to surround the contained chamber.", "When these muscular fibres contract, they squeeze the walls of the chamber together and drive the blood out of it into the forward branches, called arteries. It is prevented from going backwards into the hinder branches called veins (which we compare to the roots of a tree) by flaps which are so set on the inside of the great vessel at the entrance to those branches that the flaps are made to move out across the space by the backward current, and thus prevent any backward flow, whilst a forward current merely presses them flat against the wall of the vessel, and thus no obstruction to a forward flow is presented.", "These flaps are called the valves of the heart.", "The consequence of this arrangement is that whilst blood flows freely into the heart from the veins or hinder (root like) set of vessels, it is driven by the muscular contraction of the heart—only in one direction—namely, forwards into the arteries.", "This movement in one direction is helped in some elongated hearts by the contraction of the wall of the heart beginning behind and spreading quickly forward like a wave.", "The heart of the common earth worm and of small transparent worms with red blood like it, which are common in the mud of ponds and rivers and can be easily watched with the microscope so that one can see through their glass like skin what is going on inside them, shows very beautifully this wave of contraction.", "The heart in these worms is a long contractile vessel which runs the whole length of the body along the back.", "You can watch the red blood flowing into it through the veins in each ring or segment of the worm’s body—slowly swelling it out—so that it looks like a long red cord.", "Then, suddenly, there is a movement like a flash in its rapidity, passing from behind forwards!", "The walls of the red cord like heart contract so as to drive the blood forward into the arteries, which also are present in every ring of the worm’s body.", "At the same time you can see the valves, which hang at the entrance of the veins to the heart, swing with a sudden chuck and close those vessels against the driven blood.", "The red cord becomes colourless progressively from behind forwards, owing to the squeezing out of the blood, and by the time the movement has reached the head of the worm, the hinder part of the cord like heart is beginning slowly to dilate again with the influx of red blood from the veins.", "What causes the muscles of the heart to contract at regular intervals?", "There is no doubt that the stimulus which excites the heart muscles to contraction is in these simpler animals merely the tension or strain produced by the presence of a sufficient quantity of blood which has flowed into the heart from the veins.", "The heart muscle, after its rapid contraction, rests; it has no other rest, no sleep, as have all the other parts of the body.", "It must rest and take refreshment after each effort.", "Whilst it rests the blood quietly flows in and dilates the heart’s cavity; then the rested muscular wall of the heart, gently stretched by the recovery after compression of its elastic components, nourished and oxygenated by the blood, is ready for another stroke, and again it contracts tightly, emptying its cavity of blood, which is driven into the arteries.", "So it goes on—effort and rest, effort and rest alternating without cease.", "Whilst it is the stroke of the heart which causes the blood to flow through the arteries into the finest network of hair like vessels, what is it that causes the blood to flow on through the collecting veins, to reach the heart, and actually to distend that collapsed cavity after its stroke?", "It must be remembered that a very low pressure is enough to effect this.", "In the simplest arrangements of worms and such like animals, there is probably some pressure transmitted to the blood in the veins by the heart stroke; but the elasticity of the heart wall and its necessary tendency to resume its dilated condition after its squeezing by its rings of muscle, is what is chiefly effective in drawing on the blood in the veins into the heart.", "In man and the higher animals the whole mechanism of the heart is greatly complicated by the action of the nervous system upon it and upon the contraction or expansion of the blood vessels.", "In this way the rate of the beat of the heart is affected and brought into relation with the needs of the blood circulation in remote parts of the body.", "The beat of the heart in the human species is more rapid in children than in adults, and more rapid in women than in men, and it differs in all individuals under differing conditions.", "Before birth it is 140 per minute, in the first month after birth 130, and gradually diminishes to 90 at nine years of age, and at twenty one to 70 in man and to 80 in woman.", "But these figures only represent a general average; there are healthy men whose pulse usually is less than 45 per minute, and there are individuals who, without being invalids, yet have the movement of the heart so liable to increase in rapidity through mental or other excitement, acting by nerves directly on the heart muscle, that the pulse often goes up to 120.", "In the horse and the ox the pulse or heart beat is 36 to 40 a minute; in the sheep 60 to 80; in the dog 100 to 120; in the rabbit 150; and in small creatures, like mice and moles, 200, and even more!", "I do not know what is the record for the elephant, but as it seems that the larger the mammal the slower the pulse, one would not expect more than 20 to 25 beats a minute in his case.", "It is easy to watch the beating of the heart of a flea or other small insects—under the microscope—since the skin is sufficiently transparent.", "It is not usually much more rapid than in man, but in the very transparent little fresh water shrimps which are called water fleas (_Entomostraca_) I have seen the heart beating so rapidly that I could not count its rate.", "The heart in insects and shrimps and their like is remarkable for the fact that whilst it pumps out blood through arteries both in front and behind, it has no actual veins opening into it.", "All the veins, which in their ancestors entered the heart in a row on each side of it, have united, and their walls broken down, so that the heart lies in a sac full of venous blood from which it draws its fill, when it dilates, through a series of valve bearing openings on its surface, openings which, in an earlier stage of development, were connected with individual veins.", "The heart of the _Ascidians_ or sea squirts, common sac like marine creatures of most varied form, size, and colour, is perhaps the most extraordinary in the whole animal series.", "I have often watched it in transparent individuals of this group.", "It is an oblong sac with branching vessels at either end.", "It beats for some thirty or forty strokes so as to drive the blood forwards; it then pauses, and the onlooker is astounded to see the wave of movement changed, and the heart steadily beating the same number of strokes in the reversed direction.", "What were arteries become veins, and the veins become arteries.", "Then again there is a pause—which seems like a moment of hesitation and doubt—and the original direction of movement is resumed; then again there is a pause and a reversal, and so on, with absolute regularity.", "It is still a matter for investigation as to why and how this altogether exceptional alternating reversal of the heart’s action is brought about.", "It is a curious fact in illustration of the essential character of the heart and its beat that hearts are produced in some animals by dilatation of the lymph vessels—a system of delicate vessels, difficult to see, which take up the colourless fluid which the blood vessels exude into the tissues and return it to the heart.", "The eel has a pair of these lymph hearts in its tail, and the common frog has a pair near the shoulder blades and another pair at the hips.", "These sacs have muscular walls, and pulsate rhythmically like the blood heart, driving on the lymph fluid through the lymph vessels to join the blood stream.", "The simplest thing in the animal world which can claim the name of a heart—or, at any rate, be compared with that organ—is found in those microscopic animalcules which consist of only a single cell or corpuscle of living protoplasm.", "These animalcules may be compared to a single brick or unit of structure, whereas all other animals consist of thousands, or even millions, of such corpuscles or units aggregated and fitted together as are the bricks and planks of a house.", "In most of these uni cellular animalcules you may observe with a high power microscope a little spherical liquid holding cavity, which slowly enlarges, then bursts at the surface and collapses.", "After a brief interval it forms again, and again bursts to the exterior.", "In the bell animalcule—a beautiful active little creature only one thousandth of an inch in diameter—it may be seen to form, swell, collapse, and re form as often as twenty times in a minute (see Fig.", "41).", "Soluble colouring matter taken in by the animalcule with food is excreted by the liquid accumulated in and ejected to the exterior by this spherical chamber.", "It is called the pulsating or contractile vacuole, and by its rhythmical pulsating movement of dilatation and collapse presents definite points of similarity to the alternately dilating and contracting hearts of higher animals.", "The entering flow of liquid here, as in the veins and heart of higher animals, is continuous.", "The rhythm is due, as is the rhythm of the heart, to the alternation of a brief period of activity or contraction, and a brief period of consequent exhaustion, rest, and repair on the part of living contractile substance.", "XVII  SLEEP   An enterprising journalist has recently published the replies of a number of well known men to an inquiry as to how many hours’ sleep they are in the habit of taking, and what they find to be the best remedy for sleeplessness.", "Such an inquiry naturally leads on to further thoughts about Sleep. What a mysterious, yet sweet and lovable thing it is!", "How strange it is that we all regularly and gladly abandon ourselves to it!", "How terrible is the state of those who cannot do so!", "And then one is led to ask, what is it?", "and why is it?", "Do all living things sleep for some part of the twenty four hours?", "How does it differ from mere resting, and in what does its virtue consist?", "Shakespeare has said the most beautiful words that have ever been uttered about sleep, and that because he knew what it was to seek for it in vain—    Methought I heard a voice cry, ‘Sleep no more!", "Macbeth does murder sleep,’ the innocent sleep;   Sleep, that knits up the ravell’d sleave of care,   The death of each day’s life, sore labour’s bath,   Balm of hurt minds, great Nature’s second course,   Chief nourisher in life’s feast.  And again, when the strenuous life of the great Bolingbroke has at last overtaxed his brain, and he can no more find rest and unconsciousness at night, Shakespeare makes him say—    How many thousand of my poorest subjects   Are at this hour asleep!", "O sleep, O gentle sleep,   Nature’s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,   That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down,   And steep my senses in forgetfulness?", "Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,   Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,   And hush’d with buzzing night flies to thy slumber,   Than in the perfum’d chambers of the great,   Under the canopies of costly state,   And lull’d with sound of sweetest melody?

others show true observation in presenting the startling and distinctive flaccidity of the newly dead, which is followed after a few hours by the equally characteristic rigor mortis, or stiffness of the dead.", "There are many fine studies of sleep by sculptors, but none which to my thinking so delicately and truthfully present its most beautiful and peculiar effects on the muscular tone as a work in the Luxembourg Gallery in Paris, called Le Nid—a baby of a year old and a little girl of three or four years, asleep side by side on the cushion of a capacious arm chair.", "The pose and the details of muscular relaxation differ greatly and characteristically in the two children.", "One would like to see sleep at different ages and under various conditions of fatigue similarly portrayed, for there is a range and variety of expression in those who sleep, not perhaps as extensive, but as beautiful as that to be found in those who are awake.", "All things on the earth may be said (if we use the term in a wide sense) to sleep, for all are affected by the stimulation to activity caused by sunlight and by its cessation during night.", "It is only of late years that we have come to know of fishes, crabs, worms, and star fishes (many of them without eyes) which live in the depths of the ocean, where no light penetrates and it is always night.", "The ultimate source of their food is in the upper sunlit layers of water, to which they never penetrate, and from which particles of dead but nutritious matter (the bodies of those who have lived up there) rain down upon them incessantly, like manna on the Israelites.", "All things accessible to the sun’s rays are not equally, nor even similarly, affected by the alternation of day and night, and some not directly at all, but only by the sleeping and waking of other things.", "The food of all living things comes ultimately from plants which, in the presence of sunlight, and only in that presence, and in virtue of its action upon their green leaves, manufacture starch and sugar from the carbonic acid which exists in the air and water around them, whilst they are also thus enabled to take up nitrogen, and so to form their living substance or protoplasm.", "At night those particles or cells of the living protoplasm of plants which are furnished with transparent green granules, so as to entangle the sunlight, and by its aid feed on carbonic acid, cease this work.", "They necessarily repose from their labour because the light has gone.", "This is the simplest example of the sleep of living things.", "And that here, too, as in higher creatures, sleep is not a merely negative thing—a mere cessation—is shown by the fact that it is at night that other changes go on in the plant.", "The manufactured food takes effect on the cells or particles nourished by it; in the night the well fed, enlarged cells in the growing parts of many plants slowly divide each one into two, and each of these again into two, and so on, so as to increase their total number and produce growth and development of the plant.", "This alternation of activities in day and night occurs even in the invisible microscopic vegetation of pools and streams.", "Animals—even the most minute, only visible with a strong microscope—move about in search of bits of food—in fact, bits of other animals or of plants—and they, too, are, with special exceptions, checked in their search for food by the darkness, for even extremely minute and simple animals are guided in their search by light—that is to say, by a more or less efficient sense of sight.", "Thus we see that in a general way the sun is truly the ruler of life, and that when he is hidden from us we all become quiescent, a condition which may be rightly considered as the elementary form—the simplest equivalent of the sleep of man.", "The quiescence which falls on the earth with the setting of the sun has, however, become the opportunity of two different classes of living things to seize an advantage.", "Beasts of prey, many of them, sleep during the day, and steal forth at night on velvet foot to pounce on the slumbering animals which are their necessary food.", "Another group of timid animals, moths and small beasts like mice, hedgehogs, and lemurs, find their safety in the dark, and only then venture forth.", "Even so, the moths are met by special nocturnal enemies, the bats.", "So that the primitive arrangement is complicated by a wakefulness, exchanging day for night.", "It is natural to apply the word sleep to the state of profound repose which other living things appear to enter upon at night, so far as we can judge by changes of activity and attitude—although it must be remembered that the sleep of man is what we really indicate by that word, and that it is difficult to trace anything beyond a superficial similarity between man’s sleep and the repose or quiescence following upon activity in other living things—excepting those which by their structure and the working of their mechanism are obviously comparable to man, such as beasts, birds, reptiles, and fishes.", "The sleep of plants is the term applied to the closing of the flower, the drooping of the flower head and of the leaves of many of the common flowering plants, which occurs at sunset or during the later hours of sunlight.", "But it seems that this is not really comparable to man’s sleep.", "The closing of the flower appears to be a protection of its perfume from useless evaporation during the darkness, and the drooping a device to avoid the settlement of dew and the injurious action of cold.", "Living things always furnish us with examples of adaptations resisting the general law—and as there are moths which fly by night, so also there are flowers which remain closed by day and open at night to attract these moths, by whom their pollen is carried and their fertilisation effected.", "The tobacco plants of our gardens are examples of these night opening flowers, which attract the nocturnal moths by their heavy perfume, and there are many others.", "The movements of plants are much more definite and varied than one is apt to suppose.", "Leaves and flowers turn to or away from the sun, or to or from the position which will favour a deposit of moisture;

there is no such control of the muscles as in the waking state, the head nods, the eyelids droop, and the muscular action by which the erect posture is maintained is in abeyance, although in a greatly lessened degree some amount of muscular tone is unconsciously retained.", "The passage from the waking state to that of deep sleep is not sudden but graduated, and so is the process of awakening.", "In the intermediate condition, either before or after deep sleep (often only a minute or two in duration) the brain can still receive, more or less confusedly, impressions from the exterior through the organs of sense, and it is in this way that dreams are set going, and may be afterwards either forgotten or remembered.", "In full sleep the mind is a blank.", "As a rule healthy sleep becomes gradually more complete in the first hour, and then very slowly less profound.", "But there are not any sufficient observations on the quality of sleep after short or long duration.", "In sleep it is not only the brain which is at rest  the whole body shares in the condition.", "The pulse and breathing are slower, the digestive organs and the bladder are more or less at rest.", "Both the intake of oxygen into the lungs and the expiration of carbonic acid are lessened.", "The chemical changes within the body are lessened though still proceeding, and as a consequence the temperature is lowered.", "It is curious how incomplete at present is the physiologist’s knowledge of both the actual condition of the brain in sleep and of the immediate causes which produce that condition.", "It is probably true (though it is disputed) that the brain becomes pale during sleep, owing to a contraction of the blood vessels, and that the inactivity of the brain arises from this condition.", "But it is not obvious what determines the contraction of these vessels at the definitely recurring period of sleep.", "It is probable that the nervous tissue of the brain is, as are the muscles of the body, poisoned or choked (as it were) by the chemical products of the day’s activity, and so readily cease to be active until the injurious products have had time to be carried away by the blood stream.", "Muscular substance undoubtedly is affected in this way, and that great muscle the heart, though never resting for a lengthened period, rests after each pulse or contraction, and recovers itself in the brief interval.", "It is also probable that the exhaustion by the day’s activity of the oxygen stored up in the various tissues of the body produces a condition of quiescence whilst the store is replenished.", "Stimulation of the nerves through the sense organs of sight, hearing, and touch will prevent or retard this natural quiescence, and the cessation of that stimulation is favoured first of all by the darkness of night and by the closing of the eyelid, as well as by the removal of clothes which more or less irritate the skin;

the only thing to do is to consult a first rate physician, and strictly follow his advice.", "There are many irregularities and abnormal manifestations of sleep.", "There is the sleep which is induced by drugs such as opium, chloral, and alcohol, and that induced by chloroform, ether, and nitric gas.", "There is the heavy sleep accompanied by stertorous breathing, and there is the unconscious condition called coma. Then there is the prolonged sleeping called trance, of which that of the Sleeping Beauty, only to be broken by a kiss, is an example.", "It is not possible, in the present state of knowledge, to give an adequate account and explanation of the condition of the brain in these different forms of sleep, nor of the causes which induce that condition.", "One of the most interesting forms of sleep is the condition called somnambulism, or sleep walking, in which part only of the brain is asleep, and other parts connected with various degrees of mental activity are in waking order.", "Sleep walking is a condition which occurs spontaneously.", "On the other hand, hypnotism is the name for a peculiar kind of sleep produced intentionally by an operator on a patient by certain treatment and direction.", "In one of the stages of artificially induced hypnotic or mesmeric sleep—called the somnambulic stage—only so much of the brain is asleep as is concerned with conscious memory.", "The brain receives stimulation through the sense organs, and the patient has the eyes open and appears to be awake.", "In this state he is peculiarly open to suggestion by words, which can be made to set up the most extraordinary illusions and consequent behaviour.", "On waking the patient has no memory of what has occurred, though a suggestion received in the somnambulic stage may persist in the unconscious memory, and cause conduct on the part of the patient (many hours after the brief hypnotic sleep has passed) which is entirely inexplicable by the patient himself or by those who are not aware of the fact that he had received a suggestion or direction when in the hypnotised state.", "The senses of smell, hearing, and touch are often abnormally acute in a hypnotised patient, but there is no evidence to show that the brain of such a person can be influenced or communicated with excepting through the ordinary channels of the sense organs.", "Day dreaming and reverie are conditions resembling the hypnotic sleep.", "The brain of each of us is constantly doing much of its work in a state of partial hypnotism, and the term unconscious cerebration has been used to describe it.", "A most interesting and difficult chapter of the study of mental disease belongs here.", "The prolonged sleep of some animals in the winter, called hibernation, seems to be closely similar to ordinary sleep, but is set up by the depressing action of continuous cold instead of by the daily recurring quiescence of night and by the exhaustion due to the day’s activity.", "Many animals—such as the marmot and dormouse, the frog and the snail—exhibit this winter sleep.", "It has been found by experiment that even in midsummer the dormouse can be made to hibernate, by exposing it artificially to a low temperature, and hibernating animals can be roused from their long sleep by bringing them into warmth.", "During the winter sleep hibernating animals take no food, the pulse is slowed down, and the body temperature falls.", "The scattered fat of the body, and fatty matter and other material stored in special structures called hibernating glands, are oxidised and slowly consumed during this period, which may last for three or even four months.", "The animal on waking is often in a very emaciated condition.", "It is undoubtedly the case that the human natives of high latitudes (such as the Norwegians), where there is no night in full summer, and where there is prolonged darkness in winter, have acquired the habit of keeping awake for many days in succession in summer, whilst making up for the loss of sleep by excessive indulgence in it during the winter.", "It is by no means clear how far man is capable of resisting the demand for recurrent daily sleep without injury to health.", "Undoubtedly many men are compelled by their avocations to sleep by day and wake by night.", "The length and duration of spells of sleep and the power to sleep little or not at all at one season, and almost uninterruptedly at another, without injury to health, are matters of habit, occupation, and circumstance.", "We have no ground for saying that every man ought to sleep eight hours or more per diem, or, on the contrary, for insisting that he should only sleep five or less.", "All depends on what he is doing when he is awake, and what other people are doing (so as to disturb him) when he is asleep; and we do not even know whether ten or twelve hours’ sleep would injure a man, were he able to take it, nor can we suggest how it would injure him supposing it did not interfere with his feeding and exercise.", "As to quantities of sleep, there is the curious fact that the amount habitually taken in the civilised communities of this part of the world differs at different ages.", "Babies sleep a good part of the twenty four hours, and probably schoolboys and schoolgirls (under our present conditions of life and work) ought to be given ten hours or more.", "Whilst adult men sleep from six to eight or nine hours, it is a curious fact that old people—not very old people, but those of sixty five or thereabouts—often find themselves unable to sleep more than four hours at night, and take an hour or two in the daytime to make up for the deficiency.", "I remember hearing Mr.", "Darwin state this as to himself to his physician, Sir Andrew Clarke, who said it was very usual at his age, and difficult to explain, since at a greater age, when a man is called very old, a more or less continuous somnolent condition sets in.", "The father of a great judicial dignitary of these days, himself a barrister in large practice, when he was sixty years old would snatch fifteen or twenty minutes’ sleep at any and every opportunity throughout the day, even at the midday meal sometimes, so as altogether to disconcert those who were with him, and he told me that he never slept more than four hours at night, but got up and commenced work at four in the morning.", "The cessation in early old age of the desire for more than half the amount of sleep taken by younger men suggests that the regulating cause of the number of hours which are needed for sleep may be simply and directly the actual amount of work done by body and mind.", "This imperceptibly becomes less as men grow older, and so less recuperative sleep is necessary, though what work they do may be more effective and better adjusted to its purpose when they have arrived at the condition which is called old age.  We have seen that sleep in its widest sense comprises the simple condition of quiescence brought about in even the minutest living things by the recurring night, as well as the strangely elaborated varieties of cessation of activity in the whole or parts of the brain of man and of his body.", "Some of these cessations of activity naturally and spontaneously occur in unsophisticated mankind, when darkness falls on the earth at each succeeding evening.", "And it is hardly possible to doubt that a tendency to periodic sleep has become fixed in the substance of living things by the alternation of night and day—as well as in some cases by the change of the seasons.", "I must conclude these notes about sleep by relating a very curious case of sleep, resembling the winter sleep of higher animals, on the part of a snail.", "This was the case of a desert snail from Egypt, which was withdrawn into its shell, the mouth of the shell being closed with a glistening film secreted by the snail, as is usual with snails in this country in winter when they sleep.", "The desert snail in question was affixed to a tablet of wood in a glass case in the natural history department of the British Museum on March 25, 1846.", "On March 7, 1850, that is four years afterwards, it was noticed by a visitor looking at the case that the snail had emerged from his shell and discoloured the paper around, but had again retired.", "So the officials unlocked the case and removed the snail from the tablet and placed him in tepid water.", "He rapidly and completely recovered, crawled about as a wide awake snail should, and sat for his portrait.", "This may be regarded as an instance of unusually long sleep, natural to this species of snail, and related probably to the frequently prolonged dryness of the snail’s surroundings.", "We are led by such a case as this on to what are called examples of suspended animation. Wheel animalcules, and some other minute creatures which are found living in tiny pools of water, on the bark of trees, and in the hollows of leaves, naturally dry up when the water evaporates.", "You may dry them yourself in a watchglass; they appear as nothing more than shapeless dust particles mixed with the dried mud of a drop of dirty water.", "They may be kept in this state for months—even years.", "I do not know that any limit has been ascertained.", "But when you add pure rain water to the dust in the watchglass, it softens, and in less than an hour the little wheel animalcules have softened too, and expanded into life, swimming about whilst the delicate spikes on their wheels vibrate regularly as though they had never ceased to do so, and as though the animalcules had not for years been dried up little mummies.", "Of course, the term suspended animation has been applied in earlier times to the often exaggerated stories of trance and deathlike sleep in human beings.", "But it is now with more justice applied to these instances of dried animalcules which return to life when wetted, and to similar cases of prolonged retention of vitality by seeds, since it would appear that in these dried animalcules life really is actually and totally suspended, although the mechanism is there which resumes its life when the necessary moisture is supplied.", "In cases of trance in man and hibernation in animals, the heart is still very slowly and feebly beating, and the breathing is still—almost imperceptibly—at work.", "The chemical changes are still very slowly and gently proceeding.", "The buried Indian wizard, and the snail, and the Sleeping Beauty are moist, and chemically active, though feebly so; life is not absolutely suspended.", "But in the dried animalcule (though complete chemical desiccation is not effected), the removal of the water from the body actually arrests the changes which we call life, just as a needle may arrest the balance wheel of a watch.", "Supply the water, or remove the needle, and life ceases to be suspended; it goes on once more (as one of the rules of Bridge ambiguously enacts) as though no mistake had been made.     XVIII  THE UNIVERSAL STRUCTURE OF LIVING THINGS   Without doubt, the greatest and most important statement which can be made about living things is that they are either separate minute particles of living matter or (more commonly) are built up by thousands of such minute particles which have in each individual animal and plant originated from a single such particle (the fertilised germ), by its division into two, and the subsequent division of these two each into two, and of the four so produced each into two—and so on, until by repeated division into two, millions of corpuscles, hanging together as one mass, are the result.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "36.—Simple cells, consisting of naked protoplasm, changing shape and taking in solid food particles.", "A, is a series of four successive changes of shape of a fresh water animalcule, the proteus or amœba; B, is a similar series of three views of a separate creeping kind of corpuscle found in the blood and lymph spaces of animals, and called a phagocyte. It is also said to be amœboid, from its resemblance to the amœba or proteus animalcule.", "B, is from the blood of the guinea pig.", "It is not a parasite, but one of the various kinds of cells which build up the animal body, and are derived from the single original egg cell (see Fig.", "31) by continued division.", "The three drawings show three changes of shape occurring in the same phagocyte in a few minutes.", "It is engulphing a fever producing blood parasite, a spirillum, marked _a_, into its soft, slimy protoplasm, to be there digested and destroyed.", "In the same way the amœba, A, is seen in four stages of engulphing the vegetable particle, _a_.", "In the fourth figure the letter _b_ points to water taken into the amœba’s protoplasm with the food particle _a_.", "In all the figures, _c_ points to the vacuole or liquid holding cavity, which bursts and re forms in A;

in other cases hard concretions or coarse granules.", "But apart from other things, the protoplasm of a cell always contains within it a special, firmer, and denser part, enclosed in an enveloping coat or skin.", "This dense body is the nucleus, or kernel, and is of the very greatest importance in the chemical changes and movements which constitute the life of the cell.", "It is usually spherical, and in the living state often looks clear and bright.", "All cells, whether they are found building up the bodies of plants and animals like so many living bricks, or living freely and singly as animalcules, have the essential structure just described—a semi liquid yet tenacious material enclosing a globular firmer body, the nucleus.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "37.—A, cells forming soft vegetable tissue;

in another a jelly like mass or a fibrous network, with the cell substance scattered as nucleated particles in it (Fig.", "39).", "Or the cells may be elongated and contractile (Fig.", "37, E, F).", "They may be more or less fused with one another, as in flesh or muscular fibre; but we can always recognise the presence of the individual cells under the microscope by their distinct and separate nuclei.

_e_, the thin layer of protoplasm enveloping the great oil drop _f_, which has formed within it.]", "Schwann’s most important conclusion from this universal presence of soft corpuscles of cell substance, each with its globular nucleus, in all the tissues and most varied parts of animals as well as plants, was that the life of a living thing, the chemical and physical changes which go on in it from birth to death, consist in chemical and physical changes in each of these microscopic, nucleated bodies, and that the life of the whole animal or plant is the sum of the lives of these microscopic units.", "If we wish to know more about the real nature of the growth and activities of living things, said Schwann, we must thoroughly study and ascertain the chemical and physical changes, and the properties of the cell substance in all the different varieties of tissue.", "That is the celebrated cell theory of Schwann.", "And this examination of, and experiment with, the cells of all kinds of tissues of plants and animals has been going on ever since Schwann made his historic statement more than seventy years ago.", "The branch of science called histology is the outcome of that study.", "Microscopes have been immensely improved since Schwann wrote, first in England by the father of the present Lord Lister, then later in Germany by Abbé and Zeiss, of Jena.", "A variety of methods have been devised for making the cells in thick, solid tissues visible.", "Very thin sections—thin enough to be transparent—were at first cut from the fresh tissues, and examined by transmitted light.", "This did very well in a rough way, but better results were obtained by hardening the tissues in alcohol or chromic acid, when wonderfully fine sections could be cut and rendered translucent by soaking in varnish, in which they were preserved for study with the microscope, between two plates of glass.", "The sections were stained with various dyes, such as carmine, log wood, the aniline dyes, etc., and it was found that the nuclei of the cells and the granules and fibres both in the minute cells and in the surrounding substance manufactured by them, could be distinguished more clearly by means of their differing affinity for the dyes.", "And whilst endless section cutting and staining and careful drawing and record of the structure discovered, was proceeding in hundreds of laboratories—other observers especially devoted themselves to the difficult task of seeing the cell substance or protoplasm and its nucleus under the highest power of the microscope, whilst still alive!", "It would seem a hopeless task to examine with a high power microscope the cells (less than a thousandth of an inch broad) inside the solid stem or leaves of a plant or of an animal’s body without killing the plant or animal and the cells of which they consist.", "As most of my readers know, the front lens (or glass) of a high power microscope has to be brought very close indeed to any object in order to bring it into focus—as near as the one twenty fifth of an inch.", "Then the object examined must be very small and transparent, in order that the light may pass through it, as through the slide picture in a magic lantern, and so form a clear, well defined picture in the focus of the microscope, where the eye receives it.", "Fortunately, there are some facts about living cells or corpuscles of protoplasm which enable us to examine living cells, in spite of these difficulties.", "In the first place, there are a whole host of minute animals and plants—of many different kinds—which consist of only one cell or nucleated corpuscle of protoplasm (Fig.", "36 A); they are transparent, abound in fresh water and sea water, and can be searched for with the microscope in a drop of water placed on a flat glass plate and covered with a specially thin glass slip.", "Many of these have been studied for hours—and even days—continuously, and the remarkable internal currents and movements of their viscid protoplasm, its changes of shape, its feeding and growth, and the details of the process of division into two—by which it multiplies—have been ascertained, as well as the action upon it of light, heat, electricity, and mechanical shock, and of all sorts of chemical substances, carefully introduced beneath the cover glass.", "A second fact of great importance is that the cells or protoplasmic corpuscles, which build up a complex plant or animal, do not die at once when the plant or animal dies, that is to say, the animal or plant may be killed and fine bits of transparent tissue removed from it and placed beneath the microscope, where, with proper care, the cells may be kept alive for some time.", "The hairs of many plants are strings of transparent cells, or boxes, containing living, streaming, active protoplasm.", "These hairs can be cut off, and the cells will remain alive for a long time whilst they are under the microscope (see Fig.", "15 _bis_).", "The transparent wall of the eye—called the cornea—can be removed from a frog after it has been killed, and the still living cells in the delicate glass like tissue can be studied with the highest powers of the microscope, and give evidence of their life by their movements and other changes.", "Most convenient and important for this study is the blood—for there the cells are loose, floating in the liquid.", "The cells in a minute drop of human blood can be kept alive for hours, if the glass slide is kept warm, as it easily can be, and I have seen the cells in a drop of frog’s blood (skilfully treated) still alive, and exhibiting active movements, a fortnight after the frog, from which the drop of blood came, was dead and buried.", "These floating, moving cells of the blood are the phagocytes, which engulf and digest disease germs and other particles (Fig.", "36 B).", "Other more numerous cells of the blood are the oxygen carriers, or red corpuscles, which do not show any movements or changes of an active kind whilst alive.", "XIX  PROTOPLASM, LIFE AND DEATH   The result of the study of living cell substance, or protoplasm, is to show that every cell has an individual life, and often makes this manifest by its movement, change of shape, and internal currents of granules, as well as by the special chemical substances it produces and consumes.", "All depend for their activity upon the presence of free oxygen; all are killed by heat far less than that of boiling water; they continually imbibe water charged with the chemical substances which nourish them and cause them to grow in bulk and to divide into two; and they manufacture various chemical bodies in the protoplasm and emit heat, electrical discharges, and sometimes light.", "Some or other of them, in fact, do in their small microscopic way all that the complex, big animal or plant, of which they are constituents, is seen to do.", "The cells of the liver manufacture the bile, those of the salivary glands the saliva, and those of the intestinal wall a mucous fluid, and squeeze out or eject those products into the adjacent ducts (see Fig.", "40 C).", "Other cells lay down (as cell wall or coating) fibrous and hard substances which form the skeleton; others become converted into horn and are shed from the surface of the skin in man as scurf; others form the great contractile masses called muscles.", "One lot are told off to control the other cells by something resembling a system of electrical wires and batteries—these are the nerve cells (Fig.", "37 D), with their fine, thread like branches, the nerve fibres, which are long enough to permeate every part of the body and place it in connection with the nerve cells in the great centres called brain, spinal cord, and ganglia.", "At one time it was thought that the cells in the tissues of plants and animals could originate _de novo_ by a sort of precipitation of liquid matter.", "But it is now known that every cell has originated by the division of a pre existing cell into two, the nucleus of the mother cell first dividing and then the rest of the cell.", "Every cell originates by the fission of a preceding cell is the law, and to that is added, Every individual organism, plant or animal, itself originates from a single cell, the fertilised germ cell. These are two laws of fundamental importance in the study of living things.", "They are true of man as well as of the smallest worm; of the biggest tree as well as of the most insignificant moss or water weed.", "When the fertilised egg cell divides, and its progeny keep on dividing and growing in bulk by the conversion of nutriment into protoplasm, the dividing cells do not necessarily become entirely nipped off from one another.", "In large tracts of cells (or tissues) we often find that the neighbouring cells are connected to one another by excessively fine filaments of protoplasm.", "Only twenty years ago it was supposed, whilst the neighbouring cells were thus connected as a rule in animals, as well as being often connected to the finest nerve filaments, yet that in plants the firm, box like cases which surround the protoplasm—and when seen dried and empty by Robert Hook led him to introduce the word cell to describe them—form completely shut cases, so that the living protoplasm of each plant cell is entirely cut off from its neighbour.", "This has now been found by improved methods of microscopic examination to be a mistake.", "The cell wall in a great many plants, though so firm and cleanly cut in appearance, is yet perforated by fine threads of the cell protoplasm, so that each cell is in living communication with its neighbour.", "Thus, in plants as well as in animals, the individual cell units form a more or less continuous whole of living matter, separated by dead, inert cell walls and products of cell activity; but, nevertheless, connected in definite tracts and regions to one another by continuity of the living matter in the form of excessively fine threads.", "Those animals and plants which are built up of many cells of many varieties—that is to say, all but the microscopic unicellular kinds—may be considered as composite organisms—cell states or communities in which the individual cells, all derived from one original mother cell, are the citizens, living in groups and habitations (tissues), having their different occupations and capacities, carrying on distinct operations and working together for the common good, the life, as we call it, of the individual plant or animal which they constitute.", "This comparison should serve merely as an illustration of the individual character and co ordinated activity of the cells of a many celled plant or animal.", "It must not be forgotten that the separate cells are all derived by binary division from the original germ cell, that they have not come into juxtaposition from distinct sources, but often are held together by threads of their living material, which remain after the process of division of one cell into two.", "Protoplasm has been called the physical basis of life. Since the activities to which we give the name life reside in protoplasm, and are chemical and physical activities like those of other bodies, even though more subtle and complicated—we are justified in regarding protoplasm as the substance in us and other organisms which lives. Death consists in the destruction—the chemical undoing or decomposition of protoplasm.", "[3] In simple microscopic unicellular animals and plants, this is obvious—so long as the protoplasm retains its chemical structure it is not dead. Thus, it is possible with many small simple organisms—such as animalcules and the seeds of plants—to dry them, and to expose them to extreme cold, and to deprive them (by aid of a vacuum pump) of all access of free oxygen or other gases.", "All chemical change is thus necessarily arrested.", "But the atomic structure of the chemical molecules in the protoplasm is not destroyed.", "Sir James Dewar, M. Becquerel, and others have shown this by most carefully conducted experiments.", "Seeds of clover, mustard, and wheat so treated do not die; the mechanism remains intact, and when, after many weeks, the seeds are moistened, warmed, and admitted to contact with the atmosphere, the mechanism again begins to work, the protoplasm resumes its activity, the seed sprouts.

It must not be supposed that we regard the unique and truly awe inspiring processes which go on in the protoplasm of living things as something simple, easily understood and accounted for, because we have given up the notion that life is an entity which enters into living things from without and escapes from them at death.", "The real fact is, that the notion of spirits, whether of a lower or of a higher kind, supposed to enter into and affect various natural objects, including trees, rivers, and mountains, as well as animals and man, does not help us, and only stands in the way of our gaining more complete knowledge of natural processes.", "When we say that life and even its most tremendous outcome—the mind of man—are to be studied and their gradual development traced as part of the orderly unfolding of natural processes, we are no whit less reverent, in no degree less impressed by the wonder, immensity, and mystery of the universe, than those who, with happy and obstinate adherence to primitive conceptions, think that they can explain things by calling up vital essences and wandering spirits.", "FOOTNOTES  [3] Protoplasm is not a single chemical compound; it is the name given to the soft, slimy substance of cells, and contains many chemical compounds—proteids, fats, and others; some on the way to assume greater chemical complexity; others in process of destruction.", "The critical highest chemical body concealed in protoplasm has no generally recognised name.", "It is a proteid like body, consisting chiefly of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, with some saline constituents.", "This is the real ultimate living matter, and I suggested in the _Encyclopedia Britannica_ (article Protozoa) in 1886 that it should be called plasmogen.     XX  CHEMISTRY AND PROTOPLASM   When the chemist examines living cell substance or protoplasm—as free as possible from dead envelopes and products of its own activity—so as to make out, if he can, what it is chemically, he finds that it consists of the elements carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, with some sulphur.", "Phosphorus and some potash, soda and lime in small quantity, are also very usually associated with the elements named.", "These are combined in the protoplasm so as to form chemical compounds resembling and including white of egg, and are called proteids. A chemical compound is a very definite and special thing, and when one says so and so is a definite chemical compound, one means that it is not a mere mixture, but is composed of chemical elements (some out of the long list of about eighty indestructible, undecomposable, simple bodies—gases, liquids, metallic and non metallic solids—recognised by chemists and known as such), peculiarly united to, or combined with, one another in definite proportions by weight.", "Take, as an example, water.", "Water is a definite chemical compound, formed by the chemical union of two pure elements, the gases hydrogen and oxygen—eighteen ounces of water consist of two ounces of hydrogen and sixteen ounces of oxygen.", "At a temperature above that of boiling water the gases, when they unite, contract to form water vapour, three pints of the uniting gases (consisting of two pints of hydrogen and one of oxygen) forming two pints only of water vapour.", "This, when it is cooled to a temperature below 212 deg.", "Fahr., suddenly contracts to a few thimblefuls of pure liquid water.", "Neither oxygen nor hydrogen uncombined liquefy till far below zero.", "A proteid, in the same way, is a chemical combination of the elements already mentioned—carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulphur—but the proportions by volume of these elements to each other are represented by very high figures, not merely by two to one, as in the case of water.", "It is the carbon in them that makes proteids turn black when they are destroyed by burning, and it is the sulphur which causes the smell of rotten eggs.", "Whilst an ultimate molecule or physical particle of water consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen—the molecule of the proteid called albumen is built up by seventy two atoms of carbon, one hundred and twelve atoms of hydrogen, eighteen atoms of nitrogen, twelve atoms of oxygen, all brought into relation with one atom of sulphur.", "Probably in some other proteids the number of these atoms must all be multiplied by three.", "The elaborate atomic composition of a molecule of proteid renders it very unstable; it easily falls to pieces, the elements combining, in other and simpler proportions, to form less delicate bodies.", "Living protoplasm consists chiefly of proteids and of compounds which are on the way up, forming step by step more elaborate combinations till they reach the proteid stage—and of many others which are degradation products, coming down, as it were, from the giddy heights of the proteid combination.", "The protoplasm of a cell contains finer and grosser granules, which are these ascending and descending substances; it also contains others in solution and invisible—for, like a lump of jelly (such as the cook serves up shaped by a mould and soaked with flavour and colour), protoplasm can soak up either a large or a small quantity of water, and with the water (that is the important point) all sorts of chemical bodies soluble in water.", "Just as a lump of quivering calves’ foot jelly (which is a chemical compound of a lower grade than proteids, but like them), when placed in a shallow dish of water coloured red by carmine, does not dissolve in the water, but absorbs the water and the carmine, allowing the coloured water and any chemical bodies in solution in it to diffuse into and become physically, though not chemically, a part of its substance, so protoplasm takes up water and the compounds dissolved by it.", "Just as a jelly of water holding gelatine can give up its water and become hard and horny, so is protoplasm capable of gradually giving up much of its water, and even in some cases of becoming hard and horny, yet able to return, when remoistened, to its active state.", "Moreover, a jelly can be made to soak up or take into itself water and let it pass through its substance, so as to wash out from it all soluble matters.", "In the same way the protoplasm of a living cell is supplied with nourishing and oxygenating fluids which diffuse into it, and is washed out, purified, and cleansed of waste or effete chemical compounds by the water which first permeates it, and then diffuses out of it into surrounding watery fluids carrying the excess of soluble chemical bodies with it.", "Whilst proteids are the compounds of the highest stage of chemical complexity recognised in protoplasm, and appear to form the bulk of its substance, we must carefully avoid the error (which is not uncommon) of supposing that protoplasm is itself a definite chemical compound.", "It is not.", "Cell protoplasm includes the nucleus, that denser central body  and is a structure consisting of proteids and of many granules and dust like particles, and of more and of less liquid or watery parts which are less complex in chemical nature than are proteids.", "Some of the visible granules and invisible liquids present in protoplasm are being built up to the proteid stage of elaboration, whilst some are steps in degradation and decomposition.", "We have no reason to suppose that the molecules of any proteid known at present to the chemist really are the highest degree of chemical complexity attained to in living protoplasm.", "Probably there is present a further stage of elaboration, a chemical body even more complex than is proteid, which is continually attracting the lower chemical compounds to itself and as continually breaking down.", "This is the ultimate chemical substance of life.", "It is hidden invisibly in the protoplasm, yet all the chemical changes which go on in the protoplasm of a cell are either leading up to this supreme life stuff or are leading downwards from it.", "This ultimate compound, which we suppose to exist but have not demonstrated, has been called plasmogen. It is this body in which resides the peculiar property of living matter, namely, that of attracting to itself substances containing the so called organic elements—carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen—and of acting on them in such a way that they nourish it—that is to say, combine chemically with it to form more plasmogen.  The intermediate steps leading up to plasmogen and the products arising from its incessant breaking down are formed under the influence of this unique chemical body, and by it alone.", "Chemists have not yet succeeded in making them; only the less elaborate kinds have been artificially constructed without the aid of the living plasmogen.", "To construct plasmogen itself is a task for the chemists of the distant future.", "In early geological ages plasmogen came into being; it has gone on ever since nourishing itself, maintaining itself, growing and spreading over the earth.", "It is improbable that the conditions which led to its formation have ever recurred.", "All subsequent plasmogen has been formed by the growth and increase of that first sample of it, which once in a remote period of the earth’s history was built up by chemical conditions, which came to an end as soon as they had produced it.", "The only process in nature of which we know, which resembles the building action of plasmogen, the ultimate molecule of life, buried in the cell’s protoplasm, is the selective action of crystals, which draw to themselves from a solution or magma of all sorts of chemical bodies those molecules of a chemical nature identical with their own, and build them up into special and definite crystalline forms.", "But there is a very wide gap between this process and even the mere assimilation by living matter of the organic elements, so as to raise them from a lower to a higher grade of chemical complexity of combination.", "And over and above this we have added, in the case of living material, to the mere power of assimilation and growth the almost unthinkable complications and variations of specific form and quality, and yet further of individual form and quality, which are determined by special complications and variations of the plasmogen, that unique compound concealed in the cell protoplasm.", "We cannot at present, if ever, picture to ourselves adequately the mechanism of plasmogen, though the attempt has been, and must be, made.", "But we can watch its workings closely; we can ascertain the conditions which promote, check, or modify its activity; in fact, we can observe its output and experiment on it in a thousand ways, and so get more and more knowledge of it.", "We are not led to suppose that it is possessed by a demon, nor that in it resides an elsewhere unknown essence.", "It is enough for us to satisfy ourselves that its qualities, whilst they can be grouped with the chemical and physical qualities of other bodies, so far transcend them in complexity and in immensity of result—the whole creation of plant and animal life—that their appearance constitutes in effect a new departure, a sudden and, to us, unaccountable acquirement.", "But then we must remember that it is also an unaccountable thing to us that water suddenly becomes ice at a low temperature, and suddenly becomes vapour at a high temperature, even if we are able to imagine the mechanism which necessitates those changes.", "We cannot explain the nature of things.", "Even though we can classify them and arrange them in order, and more or less satisfactorily guess what their inner mechanism is, we cannot, in our present state of knowledge, trace them in detail to a first beginning.", "Even though we believe that such a history lies behind us, we ourselves cannot as yet show how exactly every quality and property and form of matter has developed in due order as a matter of necessity during the cooling of the cosmic gas.", "All we can do is to ascertain, bit by bit, some sequences, some lines of orderly development and interaction, adding thus step by step to our knowledge of what has taken place.", "XXI  THE SIMPLEST LIVING THINGS   In old times, if one wanted to compare a man to the humblest and simplest of animals, one called him a worm. But really a worm is a very elaborate creature, with skin, muscles, blood vessels, kidneys, nervous system, pharynx, stomach, and an intestine, and is built up by hundreds of thousands of protoplasmic cells.", "Shakespeare got nearer the mark when he made one of his uncompromising professional murderers exclaim, as he stabbed the young Macduff to the heart, What, you egg! An egg is a single cell or corpuscle of protoplasm, and the simplest living things are of the same structure—mere units, single corpuscles of protoplasm, often less than the one thousandth of an inch in diameter, and invisible except with the microscope, though in some cases big enough to be seen by the naked eye as they swim or crawl in a glass of pond water.", "Many thousands of kinds of these simplest animals and plants have been carefully recorded, distinguished from one another, and named by naturalists.", "Many of these unicellular animals (or Protozoa) crawl by a curious irregular flowing movement of the viscid tenacious protoplasm of which they consist.", "There is no firm coat or cell wall, only the thinnest pellicle on the surface.", "The Proteus animalcule (Fig.", "36A) is so called because of its constant change of shape; it is also called Amœba on this account.", "It flows out into broad, sometimes elongated, finger like processes, of which one or several of different sizes may be formed at the same time, and then quickly disappear as the whole creature moves.", "Solid particles of food—minute unicellular plants—are engulfed by the moving viscid protoplasm and digested within it—that is to say, chemically dissolved, just as food is digested in the stomach of a big animal.", "The colourless cells of our blood and lymph (Fig.", "36B) are called amœboid, because of their identity with an Amœba in shape and movement and digestive power.", "In some of these animalcules (sun animalcules and others) the processes of the protoplasm are in the form of very fine, long spreading threads which entangle a food particle, and then contract, drawing it up into the disc like central body.", "A whole group or division of these simplest animals are provided with special moving or vibrating hair like extensions of the protoplasm called cilia, that being the Latin name for eyelashes, to which they are compared.", "These cilia are arranged with great regularity in rows, circlets, or spirals, on the surface of the cell. They are found not only on cells which are independent unicellular animals and plants, but also on cells which form the clothing or surface layer of many larger animals (Fig.", "40A and B).", "Thus, in ourselves, they are found lining the windpipe, and they also line the internal cavity of the brain and spinal cord.", "The gills of the oyster, and such shell fish, and other parts of their skin, are paved with ciliated or cilia bearing cells, set side by side in thousands.", "A single cilium is like a little lash of a whip, and is always making its lashing movement.", "For a fraction of a second it is straight and upright, then suddenly curves over and bends to one side with a flick, and immediately recovers its upright position (see Fig.", "29, p.", "131).", "All the cilia on one cell or one surface beat in the same direction, and with a common rhythm, so that if the cell is a free, independent animalcule it is driven along through the water by the rapid strokes of these numberless tiny oars, or paddles.

It can be dissolved out of a leaf, not by water, but by spirit or by ether, and separately studied.", "It may be seen in solution (to cite a commercial instance) in the liqueur known as crême de menthe, being used to give its fine green colour to that preparation.", "Sunlight shining on to the green parts of plants is screened or strained by the leaf green, so that only some of the coloured rays pass through it, and it is only by this peculiarly strained green sunlight that the protoplasm of the cells of the leaf is stimulated to its remarkable chemical activity.", "The carbonic acid in the air or in the water in which the green plant is living is taken up by the protoplasm.", "Carbonic acid consists of oxygen and of carbon.", "The protoplasm, when the green sunlight acts on it, actually takes out of carbonic acid and throws off as a gas (seen as bubbles in the case of a water plant) some of its constituent oxygen, thus keeping up the supply of free oxygen in air and water.", "Then at the same time it combines the carbon and the rest of the oxygen with water (hydrogen and oxygen) inside itself, forming solid starch, which, with the microscope, we can see actually manufactured as little oblong grains in the green cells.", "Not only this, but the element nitrogen is, so to speak, forced in other cells of the plant to combine with the three elements of the newly formed starch (carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen), and thus the first steps leading to the building up of those wonderful bodies, the proteids, are passed.", "Nothing of the sort can be done by the protoplasm of an animal cell.", "Consequently we distinguish among the simplest living things those which are provided with leaf green, and feed, as do the larger green plants, on dissolved mineral solids and gases.", "There are many thousands of kinds of them—single simple cells.", "Some are known to microscopists as Diatoms and Desmids—often of curious spindle or crescent shape, others star like.", "The diatoms form on their surface a delicate, wonderfully sculptured coat of glass like silica (quartz), which resists destruction and persists long after the protoplasm is dead and washed away.", "They are favourite objects for examination with the microscope on account of their great beauty and variety.", "Those simplest living things which have not got leaf green to enable them to feed on mineral food must—unless they are parasites (as many important kinds are)—get their food, as do bigger animals, by feeding on the solid substance of other living things.", "All living things are, in fact, ultimately dependent on the green plants—whether microscopic or of larger kinds—not only for food, but for oxygen gas.", "If you could take away green plants altogether from the world, the animals would eat one another and use up the oxygen gas of the atmosphere, and at the last there would be a few only of the strongest left, like the last survivor of the shipwrecked crew of the _Nancy Bell_, and even they would be suffocating for want of oxygen.", "The single cells, which are independent animalcules, and feed like animals on whole creatures smaller than themselves, or on bits of the fresh substance of other animals or of plants, are of extraordinary diversity of form and activity.", "Unlike the unicellular plants, whose food is dissolved in the water in which they live, the single cell animals of necessity take their food in lumps into their inside and digest it, and so their cell protoplasm has either a soft surface which can take up a food morsel at any point or it has a firm surface with a definite mouth, or aperture, in it (see Fig.", "41) where the mouth is marked by an arrow.", "Many of them, especially those with soft glutinous protoplasm, which extends from the main mass in long threads or branching processes searching for food morsels, form marvellous, perforated shells by chemical deposit, either of silica or limestone (Radiolaria and Foraminifers).", "The kinds with a firm or tough surface to the cell protoplasm and a permanent mouth and gullet leading into the cell substance have very usually a single large lashing whip (Flagellata), which drives them through the water in search of prey, or they are clothed with hundreds of such lashing threads of smaller size—the cilia described above (p.", "195)—arranged in rows or circles, whence these animalcules are called Ciliata. The ciliates or one celled animals are enabled by their cilia to move with all the grace, variety, facility, and apparent intelligence of the highest animals, and also to create powerful vortex currents by which food particles are driven into the cell mouth.", "It is a most remarkable and thought stirring fact that here we have animalcules which are no more than isolated units of the kind and structure which go by hundreds of thousands to build up a larger animal—just as bricks are units of the kind which to the number of many thousands build up a house.", "And yet each of these free living units has a complete organisation—mouth, pharynx, renal organ, locomotive organs, and so on—similar in activity and general shape to the system of large, capacious organs built up by the agglomeration of millions of cell units to form the body of a higher animal.", "It is as though a single brick were provided with door, windows, staircase, fireplace, chimneys, and wine cellar!", "It is clear that there is only a resemblance and not an identity of origin between the organs of the multicellular animal and those of the single celled animalcule.", "The history of the growth of an animal from the single egg cell, and also the series of existing many celled animals, leading from simple forms to the most complex, proves this.", "And in view of that fact the wonderful elaboration of these diminutive creatures—many of them so small as to be absolutely invisible to the naked eye—is all the more curious and impressive.", "We have, in fact, parallel organisation and elaboration of structures with special uses, in two absolutely separated grades or strata of living things—the one grade marked off by the limitation that only a single cell, a single nucleated corpuscle of protoplasm, is to be the basis and material of elaboration—the other and higher grade permitting the use of millions of single cells, of endless variety and plasticity, capable of hanging together and being grouped in layers and tissues, in such enormous masses that an elephant or a whale is the result.", "And we see that the same needs are met, not actually in the same way, but in the same kind of way, in the two cases—the food orifice, the cilia, and the pulsating vacuole of the unicellular animalcule do the same services as those done by the structurally different mouth, legs, and kidneys of the elephant.", "XXII  TADPOLES AND FROGS   The season of tadpoles is not a season recognised by housekeepers and gourmets (except in France, where frogs are eaten in April), but one dear to schoolboys and all lovers of Nature.", "The ponds on heaths and in the corners of meadows now show great masses of soft jelly like balls of the size of a marble, huddled together and marked each by a little black spot at its centre, as big as a rape seed.", "This is the spawn of our common frog.", "The spawn of the common toad is very similar, but the black spots are set in long strings of jelly, not in separate balls.", "The little black body is precisely the same thing as the yellow part of a hen’s egg, and the jelly around it corresponds to the white of the bird’s egg; but there is nothing to represent the shell.", "The yelk of the bird’s egg is, it is true, much larger, but corresponds to the black sphere of the frog’s egg—the actual germ—and is like the latter a single protoplasmic cell, distended with nourishing granular matter.", "It is the excess of this matter which makes the yellow ball of the bird’s egg so much bigger than the black or rather deep brown germ of the frog.", "The little black spheres elongate from day to day in the warm spring weather, and at last the minute tadpoles (see Fig.", "43 and its explanation) break loose from the jelly, hanging on to its surface by aid of a tiny sucker, and feeding on the minute green vegetable growths which have appeared all over the jelly like mass.", "Their rate of growth depends very much on the temperature, and is much more rapid in Italy and the South of France than in England.", "At first they are so small that it is difficult to distinguish, except with a pocket lens, the little black plume like gills on each side of the head, and it is only as they grow bigger and lose these little plumes that the young things assume the characteristic shape of a rounded head—really head and body—with a long flattened tail which strikes vigorously to the right and left, and enables the tadpole to swim like a fish.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "43.—Stages in the growth from the egg of the common frog—drawn of the natural size.", "1.", "Egg in its jelly like envelope.", "2.", "Very young tadpoles adhering to weed by their suckers (placed just below the mouth).", "3.", "Very young tadpole, showing two pair of external gills  a third pair is present, but so small as to be invisible without magnification.", "4, 5, 6.", "Stages in the later growth of the tadpole  the external gills have disappeared, but the legs have not yet made their appearance.", "7.", "Tadpole of full size, with fore and hind legs.", "8.", "The tadpole has now become a small frog, and has left the water.", "The tail has shrunk, but has not entirely disappeared  it remains throughout life hidden by the skin and the large thighs of the growing frog.", "This figure has been kindly supplied by Messrs.", "Macmillan & Co., from Dr.", "Gadow’s volume on the Amphibia and Reptiles, in the _Cambridge Natural History_.]", "I suppose that every one, or nearly every one, knows that these swarming little black tadpoles are the young of frogs and toads.", "As the season goes on they grow to as much as an inch and a quarter (sometimes an inch and three quarters) in length, and develop a number of golden metallic looking spots in the skin, which give them a brownish hue.", "Both the fore and the hind limbs have now developed, but are hidden beneath the skin, and all this time the tadpole is breathing, like a fish, by means of gills, concealed from view by a fold of skin.", "Very early it acquires a pair of lungs, and by the time the legs break through the skin (the hind legs do so first) the lungs are inflated, and help in respiration.", "Now the head becomes modelled like that of a young frog, the tail ceases to grow, its flat transparent border is absorbed and eaten by phagocytes, and the legs become strong and large.", "Soon the gills atrophy, and the young creature crawls out of the water and spends much of its time in the damp grass and herbage near its native pond, rapidly assuming the shape of a frog.", "An interesting fact is that all the time that it is a tadpole the little animal eats vegetable food or soft animal food (even other tadpoles), has horny lips, and a very long intestine, coiled like a watch spring.", "But as soon as it leaves the water it becomes purely carnivorous, feeding on small insects and worms, and its intestine straightens out and becomes, relatively to the increased size of the body, quite short.", "Even those who know frog spawn when they see it and something of the history of the growth of the tadpole and its change into the young frog or toad (as the case may be) do not, as a rule, know about the laying of the eggs.", "In the early spring (end of March) the full grown frogs and toads which have passed the winter buried in holes and cracks in the ground in a state of torpor wake up and make their way to neighbouring good sized ponds.", "In these the eggs are deposited.", "The male frogs wait for the females whom they seize from behind, placing their arms under hers and round the chest.", "They hold so firmly that nothing will persuade them to let go.", "They often retain their hold for days or even weeks.", "Sometimes by mistake they seize a fish and hold on securely to its head—a fact which has led to the belief among country folk that the frog is an enemy of the carp, and tries to blind him by forcing his hands into the carp’s eyes.", "At this season a frog will clasp your finger or the handle of a stick so persistently that you can lift him out of the water.", "A large pad of a black colour grows in the breeding season on the inside of the first finger of the frog’s hand, and is richly supplied with nerves.", "It is this growth which is sensitive and when touched sets up the cramp like clasping action of the muscles of the arms.", "The eggs are eventually squeezed from the female’s body, and are fertilised by the spermatic fluid of the male as they pass into the water.", "They are, when laid, covered with only a thin transparent layer of albumen (or white of egg), and it is only after a few hours that this imbibes water and swells up into a ball like mass around each little black egg.", "Years ago I used to collect the spawning toads and frogs at Baden, near Vienna, in order to observe (in the laboratory of the celebrated microscopist, Professor Stricker, the most gifted of his day) the earliest changes in the little black egg, the size of a rape seed, which follow upon fertilisation.", "Properly placed in a watch glass full of water under a low power of the microscope one little egg could be watched for hours.", "If it had not been fertilised, nothing occurred.", "But if it had been, then there were strange movements of its surface and a puckering and sinking in along one definite line, coming and going, but at last becoming well marked like a deep furrow.", "Without actually splitting, the little sphere was divided by the cleft into two halves.", "Then, at right angles to the first cleft, a second began to form, and so on, until in the course of hours the sphere became divided on its surface like a blackberry.", "The separate pieces thus marked out are the first cells, or units, of living protoplasm of the young tadpole.", "They continue to divide and to chemically convert the granular matter with which they are charged into living material whilst the mass slowly, in the course of days (taking up water for its increase in actual size), becomes elongated, and shows the rudiments of head, eyes, ears, spinal cord, and projecting tail.", "It is a fascinating task to watch this gradual development—and a difficult, but necessary, one (which has now been carried out in the minutest detail by patient students), to harden with chemical solutions the growing embryos taken at successive stages, to embed them in wax or paraffin (as Stricker was the first to do), and to cut them into the finest slices, then to clarify these slices in balsam varnish, examine them with the microscope, and record and draw every cell, every constituent unit, as they increase in number and complication of arrangement.", "That wonderfully difficult feat has now been carried out not only in the case of the frog and toad, but in the case of hundreds of different kinds of animals of all sorts.", "Thus we know the history of the growth from the egg in its minutest details in every kind of animal—the cell lineage of the tissues of the full grown animal traced back to the single original egg cell.", "The egg of animals is always originally a single cell—that is to say, a minute corpuscle of slimy consistence, with a dense capsulated kernel or nucleus within it.", "The kernel or nucleus divides into two, and the cell itself divides; each of the daughter cells again divides, and so the process continues, until thousands, and in larger animals millions, of cells are the result, as the mass of cells takes up nourishment and increases in volume.", "When (as is the case in many animals, _e.g._ starfishes, worms, and mammals) there is only a little granular food material mixed in with the protoplasm of the egg cell, that cell is of small size, only the one two hundredth of an inch in diameter (see Fig.", "31).", "But in the frog there is much granular food material, and the egg cell is distended to the size of a rape seed.", "When there is still more, as in the bird and many fishes, the egg cell does not entirely divide as it does in smaller eggs on commencing growth after fertilisation.", "The protoplasm collects into a disc incompletely separated from the food material, and it is the disc only which divides into two, four, eight, and ever so many more cells.", "Some of the cells resulting from the division of the disc form the embryo’s body, and others spread, as they multiply, all over the rest of the egg ball from its edges so as to enclose the granular food material in a sac, called the yelk sac.", "In the frog, on the contrary, the protoplasm does not separate as a disc  the whole egg cell or ball divides to form the embryo cells, and the food granules are included in the substance of the dividing cells.", "Growth from the egg is a long story; we must revert now to the tadpoles and their parents.", "There is a tradition that Dr.", "Edwards, the father of Henri and grandfather of Alphonse Milne Edwards, directors of the Natural History Museum of Paris, kept some tadpoles in a sort of cage sunk in the Seine, so that they could not come to the surface to breathe air nor escape on to the land, and that they grew to be very big tadpoles, much larger than the size at which tadpoles usually change into frogs.", "I tried to repeat this experiment when I was a boy—without success—and I have never heard of any one having succeeded with it.", "[4] It is not cited or credited at the present day.", "But some thirty years ago it was discovered that something of this kind happens in the case of the Mexican salamander.", "The English newts and the so called salamanders are creatures of lizard like shape, which are closely related to frogs and toads.", "They lay eggs in the water, and the young are tadpoles, with beautiful large plume like gills on each side of the head.", "The tadpole of the common English newt may either lose its gills and leave the water in the summer, if it was hatched early in the season, or may remain longer in the gilled condition, and grow to more than two inches in length, if it was hatched late.", "In certain lakes in Mexico there is a tadpole like creature with gill plumes, which grows to eight inches or more in length, and becomes adult and breeds when in that condition.", "It is known as the axolotl, and was considered to be a distinct kind of gill bearing adult tadpole like animal similar to some few others which are known (Siren and Necturus).", "When, however, they were brought to Europe and kept in a cage with only a small provision of water, some of these axolotls were found to leave the water, lose their gills, change their colour and shape in several respects, and become, in fact, transformed into a terrestrial salamander, of a kind already known in North America.", "It was thus established that the axolotl of the Mexican lake is nothing more nor less than the tadpole of a species of salamander or newt, which has given up the habit of leaving the water, and actually grows to full size, and lays its eggs without becoming converted into a gill less land dwelling creature!", "The greatest interest was excited forty years ago, when the discovery was made that, by gradually drying up the water in which the axolotl is kept, it can be induced to resume its transformation, and become changed into a salamander.", "Thus, the notion of converting the tadpoles of the common frog into very big tadpoles by preventing them from leaving the water, seems not to have been an unreasonable one.", "There are some very big kinds of tadpoles, which are the young of toads of other kinds than our British species.", "In England we have only two kinds of frogs—the common frog and the edible frog—and two kinds of toads, the common toad and the natter jack or crawling toad (distinguished by the pale line along the middle of his back).", "But on the Continent of Europe there are others besides those which we have.", "There is the beautiful little green tree frog, and there are the fire bellied toad, and the obstetric toad (the male of which carries the eggs after they are laid, coiled in a string around his hind legs); and then there is the little spur heeled toad (_Pelobates fuscus_), which smells like garlic, and is remarkable for having a broad, horny claw on his heel.", "This toad is only about two inches and a half long (measured from snout to vent) when full grown, but its tadpole often exceeds four inches in length, and in rare cases attains the gigantic size of seven inches, so that it actually shrinks in size when it ceases to be a tadpole, and takes on the adult form.", "Many years ago I found some of these huge tadpoles in a pond near Antwerp, and thought they must be a realisation of Dr.", "Edwards’ experiment.", "They were enormous, and it was only on bringing them home that I heard for the first time of the spur heeled toad and its gigantic tadpoles (Fig.", "44 C).", "[Illustration  FIG.", "44.—Outline drawings of three European tadpoles of the actual size of nature.", "A, a full sized tadpole of the Common Frog, _Rana temporaria_, one inch and three tenths long.", "B, a fair sized tadpole of the Obstetric Toad, _Alytes obstetricans_, common near Paris, two inches and four fifths long.", "C, a tadpole of the Garlic Toad, _Pelobates fuscus_, common in France, Belgium, and Germany, four inches and a half long.", "Specimens of as much as seven inches in length have been captured.]", "Among frogs and toads from distant lands are some which bring forth their young alive, the female retaining the eggs in her body instead of laying them in water.", "The black and yellow salamander of Europe (which, like the common toad, has a highly poisonous secretion in the skin) retains its eggs inside its body until the tadpoles are well advanced in development, when they pass from her—about seventy in number—into the water.", "In the closely allied black Alpine salamander only two, out of thirty or more eggs produced, develop.", "These two remain inside their mother until they have ceased to have gills and have become terrestrial air breathing young salamanders like their mother.", "The Alpine salamander lives where there are no pools suitable for the tadpoles, and so they never enter the water, but remain inside the mother’s body.", "Some experiments have recently been made with these two species of salamander by varying the conditions as to moisture in which the young grow to maturity, and results of considerable interest have been obtained.", "One of the most curious arrangements in regard to the young is seen in the Surinam toad, of which we had living specimens five or six years ago in the London Zoological Gardens.", "In this toad the skin of the female’s back becomes very soft and plastic at the breeding season.", "As she lays the eggs the male takes them one by one and presses them into the soft skin of her back, into which they sink.", "The eggs are thus embedded separately to the number of fifty or sixty, each in a little pit in the mother’s back.", "They slowly develop, each in its pit, the orifice of which is closed by a sort of lid.", "When the young have grown to the condition of little toads, they push open the lids of the pits and swim out of their mother’s back.", "Specimens of these toads, with the eggs and young, in various stages, embedded in their mother’s back, are to be seen in most museums of natural history.", "Toads and frogs catch their prey by throwing forward the sticky tongue which is attached near the front of the lower jaw, and so lick up their victim with startling abruptness.", "The Cape frog of South Africa (_Xenopus_), like the Surinam toad (_Pipa_), has no tongue, and is also remarkable for possessing hard, pointed ends to its toes.", "It rarely, if ever, leaves the water.", "FOOTNOTES  [4] I am told by Mr.", "Boulenger, of the Natural History Museum, who is the greatest authority on these animals, that the explanation of this is that unawares Dr.", "Edwards made use of the young tadpoles of the obstetric toad (_Alytes_), which is very common near Paris, though it does not occur in England.", "These tadpoles regularly grow to be three inches and more in length (see Fig.", "44 B).", "Dr.", "Edwards thought he had used the tadpoles of the common frog, but had, by accident, got hold of those of _Alytes_.", "XXIII  ABOUT THE STARS   The young astronomer in _Two on a Tower_—that bitter sweet story in which our great novelist Hardy tells of the weird fascination with which the study of the stars appeals to a sensitive nature, exclaims  The imaginary picture of the sky as the concavity of a dome whose base extends from horizon to horizon of our earth, is grand, simply grand, and I wish I had never got beyond looking at it in that way.", "But the actual sky is a horror. There is, he continues, a size at which dignity begins; further on there is a size at which grandeur begins; further on there is a size at which solemnity begins; further on a size at which awfulness begins; further on a size at which ghastliness begins.", "That size faintly approaches the size of the stellar universe. If you are cheerful and wish to remain so, he concludes, leave the study of astronomy alone.", "Of all the sciences, it alone deserves the character of the terrible.", "If, on the other hand, you are restless and anxious about the future, study astronomy at once—your troubles will be reduced amazingly.", "But your study will reduce them in a singular way, by reducing the importance of everything, so that the science is still terrible, even as a panacea. The facts revealed by the study of astronomy which have this feature of ghastliness and terror relate to the enormous distances in space at which the stars are placed, and to their enormous number.", "One may sometimes see on the coast or in some marshland a pile driver at work.", "At a quarter of a mile distance you can see the great weight hoisted up by cranks and chains above the pile, which stands upright but not yet driven very far into the ground.", "You see the weight let go; it drops vertically on to the pile, and you watch it rising some two or three feet on its return journey upwards, when suddenly you hear the sound of a sharp blow, and only after an effort realise that the sound was made more than a second ago, and that the workmen have had time to raise the weight 3 ft.", "before the sound travelled to you.", "Sound travels less than a quarter of a mile in a second.", "Light also takes time to travel, but it advances ever so much more quickly than sound, namely, 186,000 miles (and a bit more) in a second.", "It is, therefore, easy to calculate the number of miles traversed by light in a minute or in a year.", "There are thirty million seconds in a year.", "The light of the sun takes eight minutes to reach the earth, so, instead of stating the number of miles of this distance, we may say that the sun is eight light minutes distant from the earth (about 89,000,000 miles).", "This is an enormous figure.", "The sun and his planets may be represented proportionately by a golden ball a foot in diameter, and a number of little spheres varying in size from that of a dried pea to a boy’s marble, placed at distances from the golden ball varying from 50 ft.", "to 200 ft.", "Such a model is shown in the Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street, London.", "Minute and scattered far apart as the planets of the solar system appear when thus represented, yet the solar system is a compact little group when we come to consider the distance from it of the other suns—the fixed stars, which exist literally in millions beyond it.", "The nearest of these stars (its name is Alpha Centauri) is no less than three light years distant from us.", "A light year is five and a half billion (that is, five and a half million million) miles.", "The nearest sun to us after our own sun is, therefore, about sixteen billion miles away, and if its light were suddenly extinguished, we should not know of its extinction for three years.", "How many—we may well ask—how many of these fixed stars—suns like our own—are there?", "Roughly speaking, we can see with the naked eye, reckoning both the northern hemisphere and the southern together (for the stars seen from the former are other than those seen from the latter), about 8000.", "Not many after all, one is inclined to say.", "But stop a minute and hear what the telescope reveals.", "With the best telescope about one hundred million can be seen, less and less brilliant and more difficult to see in proportion to their remoteness.", "And now we go further even than that.", "For within the last thirty years the great science of astronomy has been rejuvenated by the application of photography to its task.", "The invention of the dry plate, a sensitive photographic plate which does not spoil by prolonged exposure as the wet plate does, enables the astronomer to keep his telescope fixed by slow moving clockwork on to a given region of the sky for four or five hours or more, and the very faint stars, invisible by the aid of the most powerful telescope—stars the light from which is so feeble that it could not affect the plate in a few seconds or minutes, have time by the continued action of their faint light to print themselves on the plate and sign, as it were, a definite record of their existence for man to see and measure, though they are themselves for ever invisible to his eye.", "It is not possible to say how many may be recorded in this way by photography;

neither can we imagine unending space dotted with an infinity of suns!", "It is a legitimate and, indeed, a necessary inference, from what we know of these millions of suns—intensely hot, light giving spheres—that they, too, like our own sun, are accompanied by much smaller bodies, planets which circle round them, as our sun’s planets circle round him.", "Those planets have cooled down, as have those of the solar system, and so do not give out light.", "In any case, they are too small to be seen at so vast a distance.", "It is, on the whole, probable that the changes on some—indeed, many—of these planets have led to the production of living material similar to, but not necessarily identical with, that on this earth.", "It is, on the whole, more likely than not that there are intelligent beings existing on the planets of thousands of suns invisible to our eyes  suns revealed only by the print on a photographic plate of their light, which has taken thousands of years to travel from the regions of unseen obscurity to us.", "To have arrived by sober observation and reasoning at this conception is, indeed, a tremendous flight of human thought and ingenuity!", "It is the courage, the audacity—one may almost call it the superhuman calmness—of astronomers, in the face of this truly overwhelming immensity—that not only redeems their study from the oppressive and terrifying character with which it at first assails the human spirit, but gives to their proceedings and discoveries, so far as the ordinary man can follow them, an unequalled fascination.", "The daring, the patience, the accuracy, and the supreme intellectual gifts of the great astronomers rightly fill other men with pride in the fact that there are human minds capable of revealing things of such stupendous vastness and of indicating their order and relation to one another.", "It is a splendid fact, and one which must give hope and courage to all men, that the astronomer’s mind does not totter—it is equal to his task.", "Astronomers are, in fact, triumphant  they are very far indeed from suffering from the depression which Mr.", "Hardy’s young star gazer experienced.", "Among the many conclusions of astronomers as to the movements of the heavenly bodies none is more strange and mysterious in its suggestion than that recently arrived at to the effect that in all this vast array of millions of stars, the limits of which we can neither discover nor imagine, there are two huge streams moving in opposite directions, and in one or other all the stars are involved.", "Whence do they start?", "Where are they going?", "There is no answer.", "Another conclusion, which is arrived at quite simply by the examination with the spectroscope of the light coming from the star named Vega by astronomers, is that our sun and its attendant planets are moving towards that star.", "It is true that it is many billions of miles away from us, but we are rushing towards it somewhat rapidly according to mundane notions—namely, at the rate of nineteen miles a second!", "That, I think, is a fact likely to make the sentimental young astronomer as miserable as any of the records of immensity.", "In fact, the only comfort to be got in view of this fact is in the enormous distances which separate us from other stars, and the length of time which must elapse before any serious consequence can ensue from this alarming career.", "And there is further the probability that the general result of attractions and repulsions in the vast roadway of space will, when the time comes, take us safely past Vega, just as a motor car passes safely through the traffic and obstructing refuges and lamp standards of the London streets as you recline in it, abandoned to the natural forces described as chauffeurs.

Hence the sudden appearance of a flaming comet was held to be a portent, and was always supposed either to foretell or even to produce some very unpleasant event, such as a big war or a pestilence, or the death of some one supposed to be of consequence.", "The earliest Greek poetry enshrines the superstition, which is handed on by Virgil, and finally by Milton.", "In Pope’s translation of the _Iliad_ we find the helmet of the terrible Achilles described as shining    Like the red star, that from his flaming hair   Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war.

In this year of the celebration of the tercentenary of Milton’s birth, it is not a little curious to find that John Milton, himself a scholar of St.", "Paul’s School, wrote those lines when Edmund Halley, the future Astronomer Royal, had just entered the same great school, then standing in St.", "Paul’s Churchyard, as it did when I was one of the fishes, and used to see men hanging in the Old Bailey—I once saw five[5]—on Monday mornings as I passed on my way to the school.", "To a Pauline it is not without significance that the return of Halley’s comet is awaited within a year of Milton’s tercentenary, and that the greatest astronomer and the greatest poet of their age were London boys and Paulines.", "Ancient records tell of comets of gigantic size, of the shape of a sword, the head as big as the moon, and so on.", "There is no reason to suppose that within historic times there have been any much bigger than that of 1858.", "Milton, in the lines above quoted, was not referring to an imaginary comet, but to one which actually did appear when he was a boy of ten (1618), in the constellation called Ophiuchus.", "It was of enormous size, the tail being recorded as longer even than that of 1858.", "It was held responsible by educated and learned men of the day for disasters.", "Evelyn says in his diary, The effects of that comet, 1618, still working in the prodigious revolutions now beginning in Europe, especially in Germany.

It contains an account of a paper by a learned French gentleman, M. Auzout, in which an attempt is made to predict the movements among the stars of the comet of 1664.", "Astronomers had long known and been able to predict the movements of the planets and the swinging of the constellations, but, as the French author observes, all the world had been hitherto persuaded that the motions of comets were so irregular that they could not be reduced to any laws. He also hoped, by examining the movements of the comets of 1664 and 1665, to determine the great question whether the earth moves or not. At that time the earth was suspected to move round the sun, but no proof of that motion had been given.", "M.

There is now no doubt, as accurate calculations have demonstrated, that William the Conqueror’s star was Halley’s comet—a fact which must give its reappearance in 1910 an additional interest in the eyes of Englishmen.", "The shape given to the representations of stars in old pictures and engravings is a puzzle.", "Why do they represent a star by the shape of a star fish?", "No star ever looks like that, or produces a picture of that shape on the retina.", "The thing is purely conventional.", "The shape which we call star shaped—a term we apply to flowers and other things—is not in the least like a real star as seen by an unprejudiced person.", "What one really sees is an ill defined point of light.", "The pretended conventional star of ancient drawings perhaps arose from the simple artifice of picturing tongue like flames around or upon any representation of a fire or a source of light—to show what it was meant to be. Then the notions of perfection and symmetry in regard to the celestial bodies led to the tongues being arranged for the purposes of draughtsmanship as perfectly symmetrical pointed rays of a six  or eight limbed geometrical design—and latterly it is possible that the mystical figure known as the pentacle was utilised by astrologers and others as the emblem of a star.", "However they arose, neither the weird and astonishing representations of mediæval times nor the geometrical decorative stars of later date seem to have any relation to an attempt to represent a star as it really appears to the human eye and the interpreting brain behind it.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "45.—Copied from a portion of the Bayeux Tapestry, showing Harold’s men looking with superstitious wonder at the comet which appeared in the heavens immediately before the departure of William the Conqueror’s expedition to England in A.D.", "1066.", "That comet was none other than Halley’s comet, and has now returned, and is visible from the earth for the twelfth time since the Conquest.", "(From a lecture on Halley’s comet, delivered in 1908, by Professor H. H. Turner, F.R.S., Halley’s successor in Oxford, published by the Clarendon Press.)]", "The orbits of comets, says Professor Turner, of Oxford, in a delightful lecture delivered in Dublin in the summer of 1908, from which I have culled many interesting facts and presented them to my readers, differ from those of the planets in being far more highly elliptical.", "Our own path round the sun is nearly a circle, so that our distance from him remains nearly the same all the year round; but the distance of a comet from the sun varies greatly from ‘perihelion,’ when it is near, and consequently bright, to ‘aphelion,’ when he is so distant and faint that we lose sight of him. The sun is not at the centre of the ellipse described by a comet’s path, but is quite near to one end of it, so that comets approach the sun far more closely than do the planets, some taking so close a turn round the sun that the heat from it to which they are exposed is 2000 times as great as that which the earth receives.", "If the orbit of a comet is really elliptic, then there at last comes a time, though it may be only after thousands of years, when the comet, having rounded the sun at close quarters, and journeyed off into space, has his journey brought to a turning point at the other end of the ellipse, and begins to draw near again, advancing towards the sun.", "The length of the orbit of Halley’s comet is about 3255 million miles, and the breadth at its broadest is about 800 million miles, and he takes about thirty eight years to travel the full length (along the curve) and thirty eight years to come back again!", "Other comets have other lengths and breadths of orbit, and take longer or shorter periods to go round.", "But the conditions of attraction affecting a comet may be such that the return journey never occurs.", "They may be such that the comet goes on indefinitely travelling away from our sun, until he is caught by some other star, and his orbit changes its shape, with the new sun as attracting centre.", "These are the wandering comets as distinct from the periodic comets, which have been shown to conform to Halley’s scheme of their movement and recurrence.", "And now some one will ask, perhaps impatiently, What, after all, is a comet? We have seen that many are continuously, and others casually, members of the solar system.", "What do they consist of?", "Spectrum analysis shows that they consist chiefly of the chemical element carbon.", "[6] Though they have weight, and are attracted by the sun, yet they seem to be for all their size and terrifying shape and glare incredibly light and airy things.", "Herschel declared that the tail of a big comet probably consisted of but two or three pounds of solid matter—diffused, rarefied, and luminous.", "And the head or nucleus certainly does not weigh many hundreds of tons.", "In the eighteenth century astronomers observed a comet pass right in among the moons of the planet Jupiter.", "You might expect the moons to be terribly knocked about by such an impact.", "They were not; they were not deflected in the smallest appreciable degree from their position and regular movement!", "One is naturally inclined to look upon the tail of a comet as something like the smoke of a railway engine trailing behind the advancing head. As a matter of fact, it does not always trail behind, but is always turned away from the sun, so that when the comet is travelling away from the sun the tail is in front!", "It is now held that the tail is caused by the radiant energy (light and heat) of the sun, blowing, as it were, the lighter particles from the incandescent head, and causing them to spread out in a long track of variable shape.", "The photographs of the third comet of the year 1908 show that the tail can vary to an astonishing extent and with great rapidity—that is to say, in four or five hours.", "It is seen in those photographs as a scimitar like curved blade, then with a second head or nucleus behind the leading one, then actually bent like the letter Z, and then divided into seven distinct diverging plumes, and then it returns to its former simple shape—all in the course of a few days.", "Astronomers have now shown that there is a close connection between comets and the showers of shooting stars or meteors which frequently strike the earth’s atmosphere.", "It is considered probable that comets eventually break down into streams of meteors, and that their life (if one may use that term) is, relatively to that of other heavenly bodies (which are all undergoing change and, in many cases, decay), not a very long one.", "But there are no facts at present known which enable us to tell whether a given comet is young or old, and it would have been a decided shock had it been found that Halley’s comet, which has so happily spent every seventy sixth year with us for so many centuries, had burst up, or by indisposition had been unable to pay his usual visit as expected in 1910.", "FOOTNOTES  [5] The pirates of the _Flowery Land_.", "[6] I am indebted to Mr.", "Rolston, of the Solar Physics Observatory, South Kensington, for some information on this matter.", "Generally speaking, it appears that the spectra of these bodies indicate carbon—in some form—as the principal constituent.", "As to the particular form of carbon, there is still a considerable doubt, so much that, in describing the spectrum of Morehouse’s comet, Professor Frost says (_Astrophysical Journal_, xxix., p.", "59, 1909) —We avoid the still unsettled question of the ‘carbon’ bands (of the so called ‘Swan’ spectrum) which have been so often ascribed to a hydrocarbon, specifically acetylene, and we use for them the simple designation ‘carbon.’  In addition to this carbon there is the cyanogen spectrum present in most cases.", "Sodium and iron have been detected in the spectra of some few comets, _e.g._ Wells (1882, ii.", "), whilst Holmes (1892) showed only continuous spectrum.", "An interesting suggestion is made by Newall, namely, that the spectrum is not indicative of the _comet’s_ composition, but of that of the medium through which the body passes.", "Thus the persistent identification of the cyanogen bands in cometary spectra is attributed, primarily, to the heating up of cyanogen existing, free, in circum solar space.", "Till 1907 most of the cometary spectrograms showed only the carbon and cyanogen radiations, but in Daniel’s comet of that year, and in Morehouse’s of 1909, other lines were detected for which origins have not, as yet, been found.", "Thus, some form of carbon + unknown + (occasionally) sodium and iron seems to sum up our present knowledge of cometary composition.", "XXV  ABOUT CHOLERA   What is this terrible disease which every few years travels from the banks of the Indian Ganges, where it is always present, and makes its way to one or more of the great cities of Europe, killing its thousands with horrifying rapidity?", "The word cholera is used by the great Greek physician of antiquity, Hippocrates, and by his followers down to the days of our own Sydenham, to describe a malady which occurs commonly in summer, is often of severe character, but rarely fatal, and is characterised by the exudation from the walls of the intestine of copious fluid, usually accompanied by vomiting and sometimes by cramps. This malady is now distinguished by physicians as simple cholera, or European cholera, the last name being misleading, since the disease occurs all over the world.", "It is caused by a special microbe, which multiplies in the intestines and produces a poison.", "Other microbes produce similar results.", "One which causes luminosity in foul salt water has been found to produce cholera like results when cultivated in a state of purity and swallowed by man.", "Other poisons besides those produced by microbes set up a sort of cholera in animals and man.", "Drugs of both mineral and vegetable origin have this effect, as every one knows, and are used in small quantities to produce purging.", "Microbes which are noted for other obvious effects which they produce by the poisons they form in man’s intestines—such as the microbe of typhoid fever—also produce cholera like purging.", "But the name cholera, or the cholera, is now applied without any further qualification to what would be more correctly described as Indian cholera, or epidemic cholera. It is a disease which first became known to Europeans in India in 1817, less than a hundred years ago.", "It resembles simple cholera in its general features, but is usually much more violent in its attack, and often causes complete collapse in two or three hours from its onset, and death in as many more.", "The main point about it is, however, that it is a quickly spreading epidemic disease; it invades a whole population, and travels from place to place along definite routes.", "Although the outbreak of cholera in India in 1817 was the first to attract the attention of Europeans, it was nothing new in India, and was recognised in distant ages by Hindu writers.", "Its usual name on the delta of the Ganges is medno neidan. Ninety per cent.", "of the population perished of cholera in some districts of India in 1817, and English troops were attacked by it with terrible results.", "Cholera gradually made its way in subsequent years through Persia to Russia, and at last to Western Europe; but it was not until late in the year 1831 that Indian cholera arrived for the first time in England, and in the following year it caused something like a panic.", "There have been at least three subsequent outbursts of Indian cholera (before that of the year 1908) which have reached Europe, and two of these have reached England and caused profound alarm and anxiety.", "That in 1854 reached us just before the Crimean War, and caused such rapid and numerous deaths in London, especially in the West End (St.", "James’s, Westminster), that the corpses were removed in carts as in the days of the plague.", "It was then that the Broad Street pump became famous, and the carefully demonstrated history of a cesspool leaking into the well of the pump, of the existence of a cholera patient in the house to which the cesspool was attached and of the infection with cholera of healthy people who sent all the way from Hampstead to fetch what they thought was the beautifully pure, cool, and palatable water of Broad Street, St.", "James’s, caused a most vivid and salutary impression on the public mind.", "The water carriage of the cholera infection was established as a fact, and the subsequent abolition of surface wells and pumps, as well as of cesspools, in London and other cities was the result.", "Indeed, the active development of sanitation and sanitary measures of all kinds in Great Britain may be traced to the panic caused by the cholera in 1854 and to the well founded conviction that it was in the power of the community, by the construction of sewers and the provision of untainted water supply, to protect itself against such disaster in the future.", "Years passed by, and still the actual germ of cholera was unknown.", "In India it was not even admitted that its diffusion was especially connected with water supply.", "The methods of observing with the microscope those minute swarming organisms which are called bacteria became immensely improved.", "They were isolated, cultivated in purity, and the activity of a vast number of different kinds of different shapes, sizes, and modes of growth was ascertained.", "They were distinguished according to their shape as bacilli, spirilla, micrococci, and so on, and separate kinds were characterised—one producing ordinary putrefaction, another the souring of milk, another the cheesing of the same fluid, another the destruction of teeth and of bone, another the terrible anthrax of cattle or wool sorters’ disease, another (a spiral thread in the blood this!)", "the recurrent fever of East Europe—each producing its own special poison or other chemical substance.", "So it went on till Koch, of Berlin, discovered the bacillus of tubercle and Hansen that of leprosy.", "Others had failed to find what Koch now found as the result of a special mission on behalf of the German Imperial Government to India (undertaken as nearly as I can recollect about the year 1884)—namely, the living organism (Fig.", "46) which by its growth in man’s intestine causes Indian cholera.", "Koch found a spiral threadlike bacterium in cholera patients, which readily breaks up into little curved segments like a comma (each less than the one ten thousandth of an inch in length), and swarms by the million in the intestines of such patients.", "He showed that it can be cultivated in dilute gelatinised broth, and obtained in spoonfuls.", "It was, however, only with great difficulty that he could produce cholera in animals by administering this pure concentrated growth of cholera germs to them.", "Then a most courageous thing was done.", "A great and very acute investigator of cholera in Munich, Pettenkofer by name—who did not believe that Koch’s comma bacillus was really the effective germ of cholera—himself swallowed a whole spoonful—many millions—of the cultivated cholera germ.", "His assistants did the same—and none of them suffered any ill effect!", "Few, if any, of the investigators of this question gave up, as a consequence, their conviction that Koch’s bacillus was the real and active cause of cholera.", "They supposed that it must be necessary for the human intestine to be in a favourable condition—an unhealthy condition—for the Koch’s bacillus to multiply in it.", "It was by this time known that bacteria of all kinds are exceedingly sensitive in regard to the acidity or alkalinity, the oxygenation or de oxygenation of the fluids and organic substances in which they can, when exactly suited, multiply with tremendous rapidity.", "Thus the tubercle bacillus cannot be cultivated on pure blood serum, but if a trace of glycerine be added to the serum the tubercle bacillus grows, divides, multiplies like yeast in a brewing vat.", "A little later Pettenkofer’s audacious experiment was repeated by Dr.", "Metchnikoff in Paris.", "He swallowed a cultivated mass of the cholera germ on three successive days, and had no injurious result.", "Others in his laboratory did the same, with the result of only a slight intestinal disturbance.", "But of a dozen who thus put the matter to the proof in the Institut Pasteur, one individual acquired an attack of true Indian cholera, accompanied by all the most violent symptoms, which very nearly caused his death.", "This experiment put an end to all discussion, and demonstrated, once for all, that the comma bacillus (or spirillum) of Koch is really capable of producing Indian cholera, and is the actual agent of this disease.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "46.—_a_, _b_, _c_, _d_.", "The cholera spirillum, or comma bacillus of Koch; _a_, spirillum stage of growth, with vibrating flagellum, by which it is driven along with screw like movement; _b_, the spirillum has lost its flagellum, and is motionless  it is marked off into separate segments; _c_, the segments have separated from one another as comma shaped pieces, hence the name comma bacillus given to it by Koch; _d_, a number of comma bacilli of cholera which have developed tails of vibratile protoplasm (like a single cilium), and are swimming about, being driven by the lashing of these tails; _e_, a cubical packet of sarcina; _f_, a double row of the spherical units (cocci or micrococci), which form a sarcina packet; _g_, similar cocci separated.]", "The circumstances which determine whether the cholera bacillus, when it gets into the human intestine, will develop and cause an attack of cholera, or will simply be digested or will remain alive, but inactive, for a time, have yet to be exactly determined.", "Obviously a knowledge of them must be of immense importance.", "Certain experiments show that other minute parasitic organisms—especially those called _Sarcina_ (Fig.", "46, _e_), which often, but by no means always, are abundant in the human intestine—favour the growth of the cholera bacillus—in fact, prepare the ground or soil, as we may call it, for that deadly organism.", "This has been shown experimentally by sowing cholera bacillus on plates of slightly acid gelatine, or jelly.", "It will not grow on this, but if at certain points on the surface of the jelly the _Sarcina_ organism is planted, then it is found that all around the points where the _Sarcina_ is growing the cholera bacillus also flourishes and multiplies.", "And it seems probable that, just as there are microbes which are adjuvant or helpful to the cholera microbe, so there are others which are repressive or destructive of it.", "We know that this is the case with regard to some other microbes—namely, that a microbe which will flourish abundantly on a prepared jelly if it is alone, is entirely repressed and arrested in its growth by the presence of one other ascertained kind.", "It is, in fact, thus that some of the commoner putrefactive kinds of microbes occurring in river water are repressive of the typhoid bacillus, which, if it should get there, flourishes best in the purest water or in water containing no other microbe.", "There is some ground for thinking that in certain districts there may be microbes present which make their way into the human intestine, and then actually repress the cholera bacillus, should it subsequently be taken in with food or water.", "It would, of course, be of immense importance to discover such a microbe, if it exist, and the inquiry is at the present moment proceeding in Paris.", "A very striking and at first sight astonishing fact in regard to this subject is that there are a very large number and variety of microbes habitually present in the human digestive tract.", "There are so many different kinds—differing altogether from one another in their chemical action—which are present in greater or less abundance in this tract from one end to the other, that no one is at present able to say even approximately how many there are, nor to give anything like a complete account of their properties.", "The fact is that their isolation and study, and the definite determination of their properties, is not an easy job.", "Many workers are engaged on it, and it will be years before the matter is threshed out.", "One most curious result of these studies is that a person may have the cholera bacillus in his intestine—not growing with any activity, but still alive—and yet be perfectly well.", "He can, therefore, carry the cholera bacillus from one locality to another and spread the disease, and yet be entirely devoid of suspicion, free himself from disease, and certified as healthy!", "The same is true of the bacillus of typhoid fever.", "Persons who have had typhoid fever have been shown to retain the typhoid bacillus flourishing for as long as fourteen years afterwards in their intestine, without any ill effects to themselves, and to have been the constant source of infection and disease to those living in the same house with them by spreading the bacillus.", "The classical case of this is that of a woman who carried on a baker’s business at Strasburg.", "Infection by and protection from microbes is by no means so simple a thing as it is sometimes represented to be.", "Now that we are quite sure as to Koch’s comma bacillus, or spirillum, being the definite poison producing agent causing Indian cholera, it is comparatively easy to understand its mode of dispersal and infection, and consequently how to avoid its attack.", "It is cultivated in the laboratories devoted to the study of such matters—kept in confinement, so to speak, for ten years and more—and its properties and conditions of life are well known.", "For instance, it is destroyed by dryness, hence it cannot be carried in a living infective state as dust in the air.", "It is also destroyed by exposure to a heat a good deal below that of boiling water, so that water itself can be freed from it by boiling, and food dipped in boiling (or nearly boiling) water, or heated on a metal tray beneath which a spirit or gas flame is burning, can be rendered safe just before it is swallowed, even when cholera is rife in the neighbourhood.", "Ordinary lime is a great destroyer of the bacillus, and can be used on a large scale to abolish it in refuse.", "When the cholera is near one cannot be too scrupulously clean.", "The fingers must be carefully washed with antiseptic before a meal, and everything purified by heat only a few moments before being put into the mouth, since flies and careless handling may soil food or anything else exposed in a cool condition even for a few minutes.", "It is best when cholera is actually present in the house or town in which you live to swallow nothing which has been allowed to get cool; everything should be heated and eaten when hot.", "Mephistopheles, in Goethe’s _Faust_, complains of the swarming, pullulating life on the earth.", "He—the great destroyer—says     How many have I sent to grass!", "Yet young, fresh blood, do what I will   Keeps ever circulating still.", "In water, in the earth, in air,   In wet, dry, cold—everywhere   Germs without number are unfurl’d,   And but for fire, and fire alone,   There would be nothing in the world   That I could truly call my own.  The version is Sir Theodore Martin’s.", "Mephistopheles might be a bacteriologist explaining the difficulty of dealing with disease germs.", "In any case, it is the Mephistophelian spirit of annihilation, and flame as its instrument, which man brings to his service in the contest with cholera germs.", "The great carriers of cholera are human beings themselves travelling in caravans, pilgrimages, shiploads.", "For the fact has now been established that a man may harbour inside him the cholera bacillus without its multiplying largely or rendering him seriously ill.", "Once it is brought by such an individual into a favourable locality, it is spread by water contaminated by him, and yet used for drink and domestic purposes; and also it is spread by his touching things in which the bacillus can grow, such as cooked food, fruits, etc., swallowed subsequently by unsuspecting purchasers or employers.", "You have, in order to avoid cholera (and similar infections), not only to have very clean fingers yourself, but to see to it that your servants’ fingers are clean also, or else that anything they touch is afterwards heated for a few minutes to near boiling point before you let it enter your mouth.", "A little history illustrative of the need of this precaution is on record.", "In Egypt during a recent outbreak of cholera there was a very wealthy lady who lived alone in an isolated palace under the charge of a physician.", "She had a delicate appetite; her food was most carefully prepared.", "She drank and used only boiled sterilised water; no one was allowed to approach her except her servants, who never left the palace grounds, and were in good health.", "She sickened of cholera and died.", "It was a puzzle as to how she had acquired the infection.", "Her physician at last discovered that she daily partook of cold chicken broth, prepared carefully by her cook.", "The cook, though practically well, was found to be infected with the cholera bacillus, which had probably lodged in his intestine some weeks previously at the commencement of the outbreak of the disease in Egypt.", "Though living in him the cholera bacilli had not found a favourable field of growth.", "This man in handling the cold broth, the cloth used to rub the spoon with which it was stirred, or the basin itself, had, it was found by making the actual experiment, been able to transfer the minute bacillus to the cold broth, a most favourable and nourishing medium for its growth, and so his isolated carefully guarded employer received an abundant crop of the bacilli and developed a fatal attack of cholera.", "Had the lady taken the broth hot, there would have been no living cholera bacillus in it, and if she had thus guarded herself in regard to all food, by the use of heat and great cleanliness, she would have escaped infection.", "The most interesting development of knowledge and speculation with regard to the microbes which infest the human intestine and other regions of the human body is (as I mentioned above) connected with the fact that one kind or species of microbe has the power of favouring the growth of another, if present alongside of it, and that another kind has the power of checking or antagonising its growth.", "Thus common putrefactive microbes of river water are hostile to the cholera bacillus and to the typhoid bacillus.", "Those disease producing bacilli live longest and best in very pure water!", "Thus, too, it is found that the microbe of sour milk—the lactic bacillus—is antagonistic to the common putrefactive microbe of the intestinal contents—the well known bacillus coli.", "In virtue of the acid which it produces, the microbe of sour milk arrests the excessive growth and activity of the putrefactive bacillus coli.", "Hence the utility of sour milk in many cases of intestinal trouble.", "We contain within us a microbian flora of such variety and abundance of kinds and so nicely balanced in their antagonisms and co operations in a healthy man, that one cannot wonder at the timidity of the medical man who hesitates to interfere with their conflicts and established _modus vivendi_.", "Yet that seems to be the direction in which action will have to be taken.", "It seems likely that in different localities—towns, forests, highlands, lowlands, seaboards—there are prevalent different microbes which enter the bodies of human visitors and act as disturbers of the native microbian flora previously established in the stranger.", "That there are great differences in the microbian flora (including herein minute moulds and fungi as well as bacteria) of different localities, is shown by the great experiment of cheese making which mankind carries on.", "Each kind of cheese—Stilton, Cheshire, Dutch, Roquefort, Gruyère, Gorgonzola, etc.—is the result of the combined and successive action on milk of a vast number of microbes; and it is the fact that the combination which produces any given kind of cheese is only found and (unconsciously of the exact nature of what he is doing) brought into activity by man at certain places.", "You cannot make Cheshire cheese in France nor Gruyère in Cheshire, and so on.", "It is suggested—and the matter is being pursued by experiment and observation at the present time in France—that possibly amongst the other things which go to make up the qualities of the air which agrees or disagrees with one in any given locality—are the local microbes.", "This must not be regarded as a conclusion which has been fully worked out—it is an ingenious and promising suggestion made by Metchnikoff as the result of some observations, and will be fully inquired into.", "The fact which I have mentioned above (p.", "242)—that the presence of the microbe _Sarcina_ favours the growth of the cholera bacillus—indeed, enabling it to grow and flourish in conditions in which it was inert until the _Sarcina_ was sown alongside of it—renders it worth investigating the question as to whether there are local germs or microbes which in this or that region are abundant and get into man’s food and drink, and so into his intestine, and become established there, helping or antagonising the growth of other microbes already there or subsequently introduced.", "Thus, to the various considerations in regard to the air of a locality, such as rarefaction, moisture, temperature, movement, ozone, and the perfumes and exhalations of pine trees, rosemary, and sweet smelling grasses, which seem to be those which are the most likely to affect the health of inhabitants and visitors, it is not improbable that we must add the influence of an invisible local flora of microbes.", "The inquiry is a long and laborious one, but it will be carried through.", "The microbes, whether in air or water, or on the surfaces of things, can be collected by washing them into warm liquid gelatine.", "Then the gelatine is poured out on a plate, and hardens as a thin sheet of jelly.", "This is protected from all further contamination, and, after a few hours, each invisible microbe embedded immovably in the jelly makes itself apparent.", "It multiplies enormously whilst remaining stuck to one spot, and is no longer invisible, but presents itself to the eye as a little sphere, or disc, of characteristic shape, colour, and quality, consisting of many hundred thousands of crowded microbes produced by the growth and division of the original invisible one.", "Some dozens or some hundreds of little growing dots, and of many various kinds, will thus reveal themselves in the jelly according to the number and kinds of utterly invisible parent microbes introduced by your washings into the jelly.", "And so the investigator has the means of getting at each kind of invisible microbe quite detached from the others, and of separating it for further cultivation and experiment as to its chemical and disease producing qualities.", "These microbial gardens of jelly plates are, indeed, a wonderful revelation and a fitting horticultural accompaniment to the dark and gloomy forests of rampant wild microbes in our insides, where all are struggling for the soil, one crushing out another by its sheer exuberance, a third choked by the encircling luxuriance of a fourth, just as the trees, mosses, and climbers of a tropical jungle are budding, pushing, grasping, destroying one another in their irrepressible growth.", "Pettenkofer, of Munich, when he found (as Metchnikoff did later) that the cholera bacillus could be swallowed in spoonfuls without producing any harm, came to the conclusion that, though it was a necessary agent of the disease cholera, yet that there was still an unknown additional determining cause of a local character which must be present in order to render the cholera bacillus effective.", "Metchnikoff is now seeking this local cause and parallel antagonistic causes, in the microbian flora of localities which locally effect an entry into the human body, and are, on the one hand, favourable, or on the other hand antagonistic. Take as a concrete example Versailles.", "When cholera has been rife in Paris, there has been no cholera at Versailles.", "There is something at or about Versailles which does not permit cholera to flourish in men who live there.", "The guess—the hypothesis—which is being investigated at this moment, is that there is possibly a microbe present at Versailles which enters into the microbial jungle of the intestine of mankind there, and is inimical to, repressive of, the cholera bacillus when it also arrives there.", "Similarly, the suggestion is entertained, and is being experimentally tested, that there is in Paris a microbial inhabitant of the intestine which is favourable to the energetic growth of the cholera bacillus when it puts in an appearance, but that this favouring (as yet undetermined) microbe does not exist at Versailles.", "These imaginings and guesses as to favouring and antagonising microbes must not be confused with the definitely ascertained facts as to the cholera bacillus.", "But they are quite sufficiently important and probable to justify their narration to a discreet and sympathetic public.", "XXVI  SEA BREEZES, MOUNTAIN AIR, AND OZONE   Fifty years ago people were very fond of talking about ozone, and the word is popularly used nowadays to signify a mysterious attribute of the air of the sea coast or moorland without its real significance being generally understood.", "When Sir Oliver Lodge the other day warned people against hurting their nasal passages by sniffing up an unduly strong dose of ozone produced by a special ozone making apparatus, I am inclined to think that most people who read what he said wondered what ozone might be.", "In the eighteenth century it was noticed that the sparks from a frictional electrical machine are accompanied by a peculiar pungent smell in the air.", "Many years after that, namely in 1840, the great chemical experimenter, Schönbein, the friend and correspondent of Faraday and discoverer of gun cotton, found that the smell in question is produced by a special gas, which is formed in the air when electric discharges take place.", "He found that this gas was a powerful oxydiser—would, in fact, oxydise iodide of potassium so as to set free iodine—and thus its presence could be detected by means of paper slips coated with a mixture of starch and iodide of potassium.", "When they were exposed in air which contained even minute traces of this strange gas they became purple blue, owing to the liberation of iodine and the formation of its well known blue combination with the starch.", "Schönbein found that in breezy, fresh places his test papers turned blue, and concluded from that (confirmed by other evidence) that this smelling gas, to which he gave the name ozone—which simply means the smelling stuff—is present in good, ordinary atmospheric air, as well as in artificially electrified air.", "It is destroyed when such air is heated above the boiling point of water, and seems to be, as it were, taken out of the air by all sorts of dead organic matter, so that it is not present in the air of large cities.", "I remember that when I was a boy we used to test the air for ozone with Schönbein’s papers (I am aware that their colour change is not absolute proof of the presence of ozone, as other oxydising gases might, if present, act in the same way), and we used to find more ozone when a south west wind was blowing than in a north easter!", "Schönbein wrote sixty papers on ozone—but its real nature was made out by others who succeeded him, chiefly by Andrews, of Belfast, and Tait, of Edinburgh.", "It turns out that ozone is a condensed form of the elemental gas oxygen—squeezed, as it were, and literally intensified, so that three measures of oxygen gas become only two of ozone.", "It very readily changes back again—two measures of ozone expanding to form three of oxygen.", "It is produced by the action of an electric discharge upon oxygen gas driven over the discharge and in greatest quantity when that kind of gently buzzing electric spark which is called the silent discharge is used.", "It can be produced in quantity by passing atmospheric air, or better, pure dry oxygen gas through a glass tube in which such a silent discharge is made to take place.", "As much as seventeen parts in a hundred of the gas can be thus converted into ozone, and some twenty years ago two French chemists succeeded in getting even a larger proportion, and by submitting it to a tremendous pressure at a temperature of 100 degrees below the freezing point of water, they obtained pure ozone as a transparent liquid.", "It was of a dark indigo blue colour, and somewhat dangerous and explosive when the pressure under which it had formed was removed.", "Ordinary oxygen gas has since then been also liquefied in the laboratory  it is of a paler blue colour.", "The smell which old writers had noticed and Schönbein had named was thus actually obtained as a distinct blue liquid.", "It is this which, though present only in minute quantities, gives special oxydising activity to fresh air.", "When pure, or present even to the small extent of 4 per cent.", "in air, ozone is a destructive agent, a sort of extra quality oxygen of triple instead of double power.", "Indiarubber is rotted and destroyed by it in a few minutes—a sort of combustion or quick oxydation taking place—and it is, of course, dangerous to the softer parts of the human body, such as the air passages and lungs and the eyes—when present in more than a minimal proportion.", "I believe that no one has yet determined exactly how great a percentage of ozone can be tolerated by a human being in the air taken into the lungs.", "In ordinary fresh country or sea coast air only one part by measure in 700,000 has been found to be ozone, that is, 1/7000 per cent.", "But it is quite likely that much more is occasionally present, since it is very difficult to arrange a satisfactory examination of the air of any locality so as to determine how much ozone it contains.", "It is said that at higher levels the atmosphere contains more ozone than it does at lower levels.", "It is not to be wondered at that ozone should thus have attracted general attention and interest as the distinctive and specially active agent present in the pure air of the sea coast and the mountain top.", "People not infrequently, on arriving at the seaside, sniff up the odours of decomposing seaweed (containing a little iodine), and think they are smelling the ozone. It is doubtful whether enough ozone is ever present in the atmosphere under simple natural conditions to affect even a highly sensitive nose.", "But it is easy to produce enough by passing air over a silent electrical discharge to fill a large room with its peculiar smell.", "Whether it really is of benefit to the human being who inhales a properly limited percentage of it seems not to have been clearly decided by experiment, although both in London and the United States of America there are enterprising medical men who are convinced of its value and are using it.", "It would certainly seem that if the peculiar benefit which is often derived from sea air or from mountain air is due to the presence of this extra oxygen in such air, then nothing can be simpler or more rational than to introduce the proper and useful percentage of ozone into the air of specially arranged chambers in London and other large towns, so that we can visit or even inhabit them and breathe ozonised air at will without going on a journey for it.", "But it is a remarkable fact that, as with various natural so called mineral waters, so with various airs which people find beneficial—no one has yet clearly and decisively shown, in the first place, whether they exert any chemical effect of a special kind on the people who seem to benefit by drinking the one or breathing the other; still less has any one shown what is the particular chemical ingredient of the air or of the water of any given resort which exerts the beneficial effect attributed to that air or that water.", "The air in different localities differs most obviously and importantly in four particulars, namely, as to whether it is still or windy, whether it is cool or hot relatively to the local surface, whether it is heavy or rarefied, whether it is dry or saturated with moisture.", "It is also an important fact that the atmosphere consists of layers and currents differing in these qualities, and that the higher layers can be reached by ascending to high lying lands.", "At the same time it seems that in a flat country the ascent of a comparatively low hill brings you into a layer or stratum of air differing more from that of the plain or valley than would be the case were you to ascend to the same height in a mountainous region.", "The seaside and the mountain may owe the beneficial character of their air to some of the varying qualities noted above.", "Chemical differences may or may not be important, and seem hardly to have been as yet brought within the range of accurate knowledge.", "Ozone may be more or less present, so may perfumes and volatile oils, such as are given off by pine trees, and there may be more or less minute quantities of carbonic acid and of sulphurous acid, and still minuter quantities of the newly discovered gases—argon and helium—which, for all we know, may have some effect on the human body.", "There seems to be a great field open for accurate investigations in regard to the action upon human health of all these varying conditions of the air.", "In the meantime, we proceed by guesswork, and are influenced by tradition and beliefs which are based on a sort of experience, but are of a very vague and unsatisfactory description.", "The case is much the same with regard to the natural waters of celebrated resorts.", "So far as their chemical composition is known, they can be manufactured and applied for drinking or bathing anywhere.", "But minute quantities of certain gases and other elements may be present in these natural waters and have escaped until now the observation of the chemist, and it is possible, though not demonstrated, that these rare chemical constituents may have some action on those who drink or bathe in the water.", "Ever since the time of the Romans natural mineral waters have been sought, and the springs which discharge them have been frequented, not because their chemical composition was known, but because experience seemed to show that they produced a beneficial result.", "It can hardly be doubted that the baths and springs frequented at the present day are not so much themselves the cause of the benefit to the cure seekers as are the change of scene and diet, and the repose and regular life willingly accepted by those who travel so far to reach these springs.", "With regard to ozone, there remains something more to be said, namely, in regard to its application, in a far less diluted form than is possible when it is taken into the lungs, to the destruction of putrefying organic matter and putrefactive and disease producing bacteria.", "It is now some five or six years since air containing a high percentage of ozone—produced by the action of the electric discharge—was used for the purification of the water supply of large towns.", "It is a fact that river water into which such ozone containing air is pumped becomes pure in the highest degree, in consequence of the destruction by the ozone’s oxydising action, both of the bacterial germs always present in vast numbers in river water and of the organic matter on which the bacteria depend.", "This application of ozone is in use in several large towns for the purification of drinking water, for which purpose it has very great advantages.", "It has also been successfully used by Dr.", "Allen, the director of the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, for keeping the water of the marine aquarium there in a state of purity and well charged with oxygen gas.", "A similar use has been made of oxygen containing a considerable percentage of ozone by enterprising surgeons for the cleansing of ulcer and abscess.", "It is clear that such a gas may present mechanical advantages over any liquid application.", "Ozone is not, apparently, in favour or fashion with the general body of medical practitioners at the present day, but possibly further examination and determination of its physiological properties may lead to its receiving more attention in medicine.", "Already the peroxide of hydrogen—which is more or less correctly described as ozonised water, and is used (under the name Auricomous hair wash) to change dark hair by its oxydising action to a golden tint—is used by surgeons for washing out purulent wounds and abscess.", "Those who use the gas itself only go a step further.", "Some day we may see a more general use of ozone; on the other hand, it remains to be seen by direct and accurate experiment whether its properties are as valuable to man as we may hope they will prove to be.", "XXVII  OXYGEN GAS FOR ATHLETES AND OTHERS   Since the preceding chapter on ozone was written I have learned that this peculiar triple condensed variety of oxygen (it is called by chemists O_{3} whereas ordinary oxygen is O_{2}) is now being most successfully applied to the purification of the water supply of several large cities.", "A notable case is that of the great winter resort, Nice.", "Ozone gas is one of the most effective destroyers of organic impurity known; it destroys both bacterial germs and the putrescible impurities of water completely, and is itself converted in the process into harmless health giving oxygen, whilst the water is rendered absolutely free of all germs.", "It is readily manufactured by treating oxygen with the electric discharge, and is produced at a cost which renders its use in water purification an economical and financially satisfactory method.", "The use of ozone gas as a medicinal application to cavities in the living body in which disease producing bacteria are lodged is making progress.", "It has to be administered with great care by a medical expert, and though there has been delay and opposition on account of the novelty of the treatment, there are signs that ozone will become established as a valuable therapeutic agent.", "It is a singular fact that so little has been done of late by scientific observers either as to the presence of ozone in the atmosphere or as to the action of ozone on the healthy animal body when present in minute quantity in the air taken into the lungs.", "The general opinion appears to be that it is either altogether absent from the atmosphere or present only in quantity so minute as to be negligible from the point of view of the physiologist except in very high mountain regions, and there the exact quantity remains undetermined.", "The only experiments in the last ten years on the subject of its action on animals are some which led the inquirers to the conclusion that constant exposure (in a closed chamber) to an atmosphere containing 4 per cent.", "of ozone caused death after five or six days by an inflammation of the lungs.", "Clearly it is desirable that further investigation on this subject by competent authorities should be made, and the effect of smaller quantities of ozone in the air respired, whether continuously or at intervals, should be ascertained.", "The action of ordinary oxygen gas is a separate matter.", "The atmosphere which we breathe consists of one part by volume of this gas and of four parts of nitrogen gas.", "It is the oxygen which is necessary to us and to all animals, and the nitrogen is merely an inert diluting accompaniment of the essential oxygen gas.", "It is, of course, easy to increase or to diminish the proportion of oxygen in the air breathed accordingly as one introduces additional pure oxygen or, on the other hand, diluting nitrogen into a collapsible bag or sac from which one continuously draws breath.", "Such a bag can be connected by a tube to a helmet or mask enveloping the head.", "The expired air is discharged by a specially provided passage.", "It used to be thought that it was dangerous to breathe pure undiluted oxygen, although the proportion of oxygen to nitrogen in the air taken into the lungs might be increased to as much as a half without injury, and, indeed, with great benefit in some serious conditions of collapse.", "Dr.", "Leonard Hill, F.R.S., of the London Hospital Medical College, has, however, recently shown that oxygen gas, of 97 per cent.", "purity, may be breathed continuously for as much as two hours without any ill effects or sense of inconvenience.", "Contrary to what has been stated, it is neither exciting nor unpleasant.", "He has made the experiment on himself and on some of his assistants, and in doing so has made use of such an apparatus as that above mentioned—so as to ensure the in take of undiluted oxygen.", "Dr.", "Hill and Mr.", "Martin Flack have further found that the exhaustion and labouring of the heart which is brought on by such special exertion as that involved in running a hundred yards race or a quarter mile race, is almost completely avoided if the runner fills his lungs with oxygen gas before starting.", "The runner takes the oxygen gas into the lungs for some two or three minutes before starting to race; of course, the lungs are not thus actually filled with oxygen, but a much larger proportion of that gas is lodged in them than when ordinary air is breathed, and a full supply is thus afforded to the blood.", "The distress caused by violent athletic efforts appears to be entirely due to the using up of the available oxygen by the unusual activity of the muscles.", "The heart itself suffers most, the breathing becomes laboured, and there is a sense of suffocation, due simply to the urgent demand by the blood, heart and muscles for more oxygen.", "If, therefore, we ensure that there is an extra supply of pure oxygen in the lungs before the unusual effort is made, we avert these distressing symptoms  the unusual quantity of oxygen needed is ready for use.", "Dr.", "Hill himself and young men who have tried the plan of inspiration of oxygen before a foot race, declare that they cannot believe that they are really running hard, even when surpassing their usual performance.", "They come in at the end of the quarter mile, having beaten their record; and with no sense of having made a special effort; they feel fresh and ready to start again after more oxygen and a short rest.", "Moreover, the after effect on the muscles is stated to be such that stiffness and what is called grogginess (due in ordinary circumstances to the retention of lactic acid in the muscle) do not supervene.", "Swimming and diving, as one would expect, are greatly affected by the preliminary oxygen inhalation; the length of time during which submersion can be endured without discomfort is doubled, and the great effort of fast swimming rendered less rapidly exhausting.", "Cycling uphill at a rapid pace becomes, according to Dr.", "Hill’s own frequent experience, possible after oxygen inhalation when in ordinary conditions it was impossible.", "Hockey players and boxers he has found notably benefited by oxygen given both in the intervals of and after the exercise.", "It is, of course, to be expected that a wider practical application should be made of this simple method of increasing our power of sustaining muscular effort, and of enduring submersion.", "Dr.", "Hill suggests that the divers of the Mediterranean, who, without any apparatus, plunge into the shallow sea and remain below long enough to find, cut, and bring to the surface the valuable sponges of commerce, might use the method of preliminary inhalation of pure oxygen gas.", "He has also tried the method with a young racehorse, but owing to the fact that the course run was only a mile, and the animal perfectly fit and strong, he tells me that no advantage was found to result from the inhalation.", "With an older cart horse somewhat tired by a day’s work—he obtained the most satisfactory results, the animal becoming obviously recuperated and working without distress.", "The question has been raised as to whether the administration of oxygen gas to a man or to a horse when about to run a race should be considered as doping. It may perhaps be objected to by sportsmen, as involving the provision of special apparatus which all competitors would not be equally able to secure.", "But it is not doping, since that applies to the use of a drug, which, whilst exciting to violent effort, produces an injurious after effect.", "Oxygen is not in this category; to take an extra quantity of oxygen into the lungs before starting on a race is no more unnatural or risky than to take an extra drink of water into the stomach or to swallow meat extract and such special preparations before or during a race.", "It would be interesting to see whether a runner in the Marathon race would (as Dr.", "Hill would expect) be greatly assisted if his trainer carried with him a supply of pure oxygen, and from time to time refreshed him with it.", "Football players might also be given oxygen at half time; an oxygenated team would, one surmises, beat its uninspired competitors.", "A Fife team is reported to have done so.", "On the roads favoured by cyclists one may expect hereafter to find at the bottom of a long ascent hawkers of breaths of oxygen provided with gas bags and calling out Buy the lady a breff, sir! It is, perhaps, worth noting that the relief afforded by oxygen breathing is no less definite when the gas is taken immediately after a race or sustained effort than when used as a preliminary.", "The excess of choke gas or carbonic acid formed during great muscular effort is not the principal cause of the distress experienced.", "That gas is thrown off by increased expiration.", "It is the using up of the oxygen and the insufficiency of the supply in the atmospheric air inspired that causes, under these circumstances, giddiness, exhaustion, and often collapse.", "The difficulty in breathing and the prostration experienced by many people in mountain climbing is largely due, not merely to the muscular effort of climbing, but to the fact that the rarefied atmosphere at heights of 8000 ft.", "to 15,000 ft.", "and more gives into the lungs in every inspiration but a fraction of the oxygen which is inspired at low levels, and moreover, owing to the low pressure, much less is held in the blood.", "Even when conveyed by mule, cog rail, or balloon to these heights—and, therefore, without muscular exertion, sensitive people suffer severely from temporary oxygen starvation. They as well as the laborious mountaineer could be saved from all such inconvenience by the use of a skilfully constructed traveller’s flask of oxygen gas.", "The observations and experiments as to the possible use of pure oxygen by athletes suggest that we might all benefit by occasional if not frequent use of such an atmosphere.", "Indeed, there are some individuals—amongst others a well known and distinguished actor—who before making some special effort, or even when feeling tired and unequal to their daily work, inhale under medical supervision a certain quantity of oxygen gas.", "It would certainly seem that since country air, sea air, and mountain air are useful and refreshing, an artificial supply of extra oxygen might be inhaled in London, either in one’s own house or in establishments provided for the purpose, with definite benefit to health, especially if the inhalation were combined with exercise.", "The experiments made by Dr.", "Hill have come about in connection with work undertaken for the purpose of improving the diving and life saving apparatus named after its inventor, Fleuss.", "This invention consists essentially in a water tight helmet and jacket connected with a cylinder of compressed oxygen gas which is carried by the diver.", "The advantage of such an arrangement is that the diver is free from pumping apparatus and can go where an ordinary diver could not.", "Mr.", "Fleuss was able, by diving with this apparatus, to prevent an immense loss of property by arresting the flooding of the Severn tunnel which was imminent during its construction.", "A difficulty in regard to the Fleuss apparatus has been that oxygen gas is a poison, causing inflammation of the lungs and convulsions when under a pressure of from two to three atmospheres—that is to say, at from 30 ft.", "to 60 ft.", "depth in water.", "The pressure exercised by the air of the atmosphere at sea level is equal to that exercised by a column of water 30 ft.", "high, and hence at 30 ft.", "depth in the sea the oxygen gas would be under the pressure both of the atmosphere itself and of water to the same amount—which is expressed by saying that it is under two atmospheres’ pressure, or twice the atmosphere’s pressure.", "The pressure of the atmosphere is, in plain figures, 15 lb.", "on every square inch of surface.", "Of course, the oxygen is compressed far beyond this point in the cylinders in which it is carried.", "In using it, it is allowed to escape by opening a valve leading into an elastic sac, and is then and there subject to the pressure depending on the depth of water to which the diver has descended.", "It is found to be dangerous for a diver with this apparatus to descend to a depth of more than 30 ft.", "having pure oxygen in his apparatus, because the oxygen is then compressed under a pressure of two atmospheres.", "Accordingly, Dr.", "Haldane, of Oxford, has proposed that the oxygen should be diluted with atmospheric air, so as to give a mixture of equal volumes of oxygen and nitrogen.", "With this mixture the diver can safely descend to a depth of 60 ft.", "The apparatus is provided with a partition containing caustic soda, which absorbs the carbonic gas thrown out of the lungs in expiration.", "With such an apparatus a diver can safely remain under water at a depth of 60 ft., and walk about and explore for as long as two hours.", "A most important application of this self contained diving apparatus is found in its use in the exploration of mines, where smoke or gaseous products resulting from an explosion render it impossible for rescue parties to penetrate without its use.", "It has been the means of saving many lives in such circumstances.", "A form of this apparatus is made in which the oxygen is supplied, not by a cylinder of compressed gas, but by granules of a chemical compound called pneumatogen, a peroxide of sodium and potassium, which when breathed into absorbs carbonic acid from the air expired by the lungs, and gives off pure oxygen.", "Submarine ships are now being provided with a dress or outfit of this description for each member of the crew, so that in the case of the entrance of water into the submarine, every man can put on his oxygen helmet, and one by one, when the ship is full of water, they can pass out by the conning tower and float to the surface.", "The perfected diving dress, with self contained diluted oxygen supply and other improvements, has been constructed by Siebe, Gorman, and Co., and was exhibited by Dr.", "Leonard Hill at a soiree of the Royal Society.", "XXVIII  SPARROWS, TROUT, AND SELECTIVE BREEDING   The talk about the urgent need for the destruction of sparrows reminds me that the word sparrow is applied commonly in this country to at least two very different but common birds.", "No doubt farmers and gardeners know well enough the house sparrow (_Passer domesticus_ or _Fringilla domestica_ of Linnæus), which is the one they consider injurious.", "But some boys and some newly fledged proprietors of country places may inadvertently confuse the house sparrow with a very different bird, though only a little smaller and of a general brown colouring, also called sparrow, namely, the hedge sparrow (_Accentor modularis_).", "The hedge sparrow is a true denizen of the country.", "It does not live on grain, but on insects and grubs, and is useful on that account to agriculturists.", "Its eggs are pure blue.", "A spotted egg of a cuckoo laid amongst them readily catches the eye, so that cuckoos’ eggs are often found in hedge sparrows’ nests.", "It seems that it is all a mistake on the part of the cuckoo hen when this occurs.", "The strain of cuckoos properly attached to hedge sparrows lay a beautiful blue egg differing only in its somewhat larger size from those of the hedge sparrow itself, and hence difficult to detect.", "These blue cuckoo eggs—proper to cuckoos which make use of the hedge sparrow as foster mother—escape detection both by boys and the foster parents, and successfully hatch out and propagate the race of blue egged cuckoos with a memory and a sense of smell which bring them back if they are hen birds to the little hedge sparrow’s nest when they are grown up and have an egg to dispose of.", "The spotted grey or brownish eggs are, if not discovered by boys, ejected (there is reason to believe) by the hedge sparrows themselves.", "They were deposited by mistake by some pippet loving or warbler seeking strain of cuckoo in a hurry, or are throw backs to a common ancestral colouring of the egg due, perhaps, to the male parent not being of the true blue strain.", "A very fine series of clutches and nests of hedge sparrow, robin, shrike, reed warbler, pippet, yellow hammer, and other birds with the accompanying cuckoo’s egg may be seen in the Natural History Museum, and they show how closely the parasitic egg often resembles that of the foster parent, though striking failures also occur.", "The hedge sparrow is placed in that group of small birds which includes the robin, the thrushes, and the warblers; it is not a finch.", "On the other hand, the house sparrow is a finch, allied to the chaffinch, the goldfinch, and the brambling.", "It has, like all the finches, a very powerful broad based beak, and is more than a match for bigger birds than itself.", "It is really a parasite or commensal (messmate) of man, living and flourishing entirely by helping itself to the grain and the young buds of shrubs grown by man, and in towns to the waste fragments of his food and the grain left in horse dung.", "Whether it does any good in the early part of the year by eating grubs seems to be doubtful, but the conclusion is justified that it does more harm than good, especially as it drives away other small birds which are exclusively insectivorous.", "It has gone with European man to all temperate climates.", "There are Spanish, African, Italian and Indian species, closely related to the common house sparrow, which I should like to see put out side by side with it and some of its varieties for the public edification in the Natural History Museum.", "These are the true sparrows, and should be compared side by side with the hedge sparrow, and the differences pointed out.", "There is another true sparrow in England, called the tree sparrow, which is not nearly so common as the house sparrow.", "They are, however, so closely allied to one another that hybrids have been produced between the two.", "On the other hand, the hedge sparrow is a great deal too remote from the finches to interbreed with the house sparrow or any other of the finch group.", "There ought to be a careful report on the probable effects, in every direction, of a great destruction of house sparrows before any very drastic measures are taken in that direction.", "The employers of gamekeepers should remember that by destroying owls, hawks, and weasels they may not only enable small injurious birds to flourish in excess, but that they may encourage disease and weakness in the game birds which they so eagerly desire to multiply, since the natural extermination of weakly birds by birds and animals of prey is put an end to when the latter are abolished.", "In all such matters more knowledge is needed, and reasonable people will not take irretrievable action until they have taken the trouble to obtain thorough knowledge.", "It is a curious fact that though the house sparrow does not naturally sing, yet hand reared house sparrows have been made, by association with bull finches, to acquire the song of that bird—a truly astonishing instance of hidden or latent capacity.", "A lover of trout fishing has been writing lately upon the question as to whether the trout in much fished rivers and lakes do or do not exhibit increased wariness, or even intelligent caution in avoiding the flies so cunningly thrown before or above them by the skilful angler.", "It is argued that there cannot really be any increased indisposition of trout to take the fly based on experience, because on an estimate of the number of trout in a river like the Test, and of the limited number of anglers, every fisherman would have to hook and lose some thousands of fish every year for the experience to be general among trout that the horrid artificial flies hide a still more horrid hook. It is, of course, held that the trout cannot communicate their experiences to one another by any form of conversation (though leadership and imitative habit might have some effect), and it is also not suggested that a trout which had acquired an overpowering aversion to the angler’s fly as a result of being hooked and breaking free, could transmit that aversion to its offspring by the mere fact of reproduction.", "Hence it is maintained that there is no such increasing wariness in English and Scotch trout.", "It is a curious thing that in discussing this matter the fundamental principle should have been overlooked by which Darwin and Wallace have long ago explained to the satisfaction of naturalists, the aversions and cautious proceedings of all kinds of animals, from the smallest insects up to birds, beasts, and fishes.", "The principle of natural selection and survival of the fittest accounts for the increased caution of trout in well fished rivers in the simplest way.", "Assume (as is perfectly reasonable) that some trout are more shy than others by nature, that is to say, are born so, that some are born with a slightly more rapid response to the sight of food than others—as one sees often enough with a lot of the young of any animal—then the increased shyness or pretended intelligence of the trout after many years’ fishing follows as a necessity.", "The rash fish are caught and destroyed, the shy fish remain in the river, and—here is the important point, a well ascertained fundamental law of heredity—propagate their like.", "They produce shy fish.", "Every year this selection goes on till you get a race of fish in the well fished river which are so shy that they cease to rise at all!", "This unpleasant result is avoided by the proprietors of trout streams to a certain extent by introducing a race of trout which has not in consequence of over fishing developed an innate shyness of character (such as the Loch Leven and some others) to mix and breed with the timid over fished race.", "It is in the same way that the human population of country villages, most sad to see, is every year rendered less intelligent than it was a hundred years ago.", "All the enterprising, intelligent young men and maidens are fished away, drawn by baits and hooks to the great towns; only the dull and relatively incapable are left in the village to marry and produce a new generation.", "The village population necessarily becomes made up of a dull stock—incapable, as appears from official reports, of being educated beyond a very low stage.", "In some districts 70 per cent.", "of the children are thus unintelligent, though not unhealthy or imbecile.", "It is possible that the want of home training and example in very early childhood is to some extent a cause of the dullness of village children.", "And so it goes on, generation after generation, as facilities for leaving the village increase and inducements to stay or return decrease.", "The 30 per cent.", "of the new generation who have any wits leave the village, never to return.", "And no one re stocks the village.", "That must be taken in hand soon.", "XXIX  THE FEEBLE MINDED   A considerable proportion of the young which are produced as a new generation of either plants or animals are not merely unlike their parents in some small particulars of colour, proportion, activity, and so on, but are, as compared with the normal or usual standard of the species, defective; that is to say, they are wanting in some organ or part, as though maimed, or by some cause restricted or reduced in regard to that part.", "This occurs in human beings, and in domesticated animals more obviously than in wild animals and plants, for two reasons  firstly, because in wild conditions the defective young die off very early in the struggle for existence and so escape human observation; whereas man protects his own defective young, and often, also, those of domesticated animals, so that they are allowed to grow up more or less; secondly, such defective structure appearing at birth, and therefore called congenital, is carried on by heredity, more or less completely, should the defective animal or plant be allowed to breed.", "Such breeding of defective individuals is prevented in wild nature by their early destruction; their defects cause their early death by unfitting them for the competition and struggle which are in natural conditions rigidly severe.", "Only a few survive among the many thousands of each species born into conditions of limited food and space—conditions which are not sufficient to support more than a very small number so as to enable them to reach the adult or breeding stage of life.", "But man, on the contrary, protects his own young, and often those of his domesticated animals and plants, from this destructive competition, and thus allows those which are to a certain extent defective to breed.", "The official returns of the Registrar General record every year a proportion of deaths of infants which are entered as due to congenital defects. These defects are of many and various kinds.", "A frequent congenital defect is one which does not necessarily cause death, namely, the imperfection of the wonderfully elaborate organ of sight, rendering it useless.", "Children often are born blind, and so are a certain proportion of each species of animal normally provided with eyes—dogs, horses, cattle, birds, fish.", "Even insects, lobsters, and crabs are in quite considerable and definite number born blind.", "The inborn or congenital defects of the eyes which result in blindness are of several kinds.", "The whole of the eyeball or eye structure may be atrophied, that is to say, dwindled and incomplete, or one essential part only may be defective, and the rest quite well formed; or, again, the nerves connecting the eye with the brain or the several parts of the brain concerned in the function of sight may, one or more of them, be defective.", "Wild animals born in this condition must perish, except when they happen to be born in caverns or in the deep sea.", "Then they are no worse off than animals with good eyes.", "But the animals with good eyes, or even with only somewhat defective eyes, will follow up the gleams of light which in moving about they have the fortune to encounter, and so will escape from the cavern or dark depths of the sea, leaving behind in the dark only those with defective eyes.", "These will breed together, and perpetuate their defective eyes in a more and more marked degree in successive generations.", "Always those which can see, or see only a little, will leave the dark place, and so at last there will be a race of animals established in such places with defective eyes (as in the ocean, at a depth of two thousand fathoms, and in the great caves of Europe, and notably in the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky, U.S.A.", "), and often the eyes will altogether disappear.", "This, however, is a digression.", "The cause of congenital defect in eyes is not obvious.", "The failure of the germinal substance of the reproductive egg or particle detached from parents with sound eyes, to unfold itself—to develop—into a creature with sound eyes like those of its parents, is apparently due, in some instances, to one cause, and in other instances to other causes, of none of which can it be said that we have a satisfactory and comprehensive knowledge.", "The same want of full knowledge exists in regard to the causation of other congenital defects.", "These are as numerous and varied as the parts of the body which may be from birth onwards, in one instance or another, distorted, devoid of some essential inner structure, swollen to great size, or shrunken, or even absent altogether.", "Such defects are sometimes caused by mechanical pressure or nipping in early stages of growth before birth, but there are many which cannot be accounted for in that way.", "The wonder really is not that the inconceivably complex structure of higher animals should sometimes fail, in this or that part, to develop in due course from the simple looking germ, destitute of visible structure, but that it should, on the contrary, so regularly and completely come off successfully in millions of instances every day.", "We can imagine or suggest disturbing agencies which may be the causes of failure, but it is very difficult to demonstrate with certainty the causes which have been at work in each and every case.", "One result of failure of the germ to grow up into the perfect likeness of its parents is that it may throw back, as the breeders say, and resemble in this or that quality a remote, even an extremely remote, ancestor.", "It is suggested by some inquirers that the congenital or inborn defect, frequent in human beings, which is called feeble mindedness is a reversion or throw back to the condition of the brain in the animal ancestors of man.", "That is possible, and, in view of some cases, seems probable.", "But it must be noted that we do not know what are the causes which favour throwing back, or atavism, as it is called, in regard to all sorts of structures, and that the mechanical conditions connected with the growth of the cavity of the skull in which the brain itself grows are so very elaborate that it is obvious that a very slight disturbance of one element or another might arrest or turn aside the growth of that vastly complex organ, which has become so much larger and more delicate in man than in the animals from which he has, at no remote period in the history of life on the earth, taken his origin.", "Mankind have always within the period of written records (a mere trifle in the lapse of time since man became man) regarded mental defect and aberration as due to fantastic causes.", "To this day we use the word lunatic for one of the two typical forms of mental aberration  we imply that the moon is concerned in its production.", "The other form of brain failure has appropriated the term idiot, which, it is surprising to find, was less than two centuries ago applied in common speech to any person who was characterised by independence of judgment.", "The term softy is a common and really more suitable term for this class, whilst cracked is the word applied to a lunatic.", "The notion that mental aberration is due to possession by evil spirits, which can be expelled and the patient accordingly cured, was prevalent a century ago, and the belief is common at the present day (though quite erroneous) that people go mad in virtue of some immaterial and unaccountable influence, and may therefore go sane again.", "The lunacy laws and the laws relating to the care of the feeble minded in this country are admitted to be tainted with ignorance and misconception, and both are in process of correction by the Government of the day.", "The approved professional terms used in distinguishing the varieties of the mind diseased are not accepted with much favour by the public, and it is unnecessary to introduce them here.", "The important fact is that persons of diseased mind may be separated into two groups—(_a_) the idiots or softies, and (_b_) the lunatics or cracked people.", "The idiotic group are those with a defective amount or quality of brain substance (whether the skull itself is small or abnormally distended by water on the brain), and are more or less incapable of being educated.", "They are often subject to epileptic fits, and are usually weakly in build, though they sometimes have great muscular strength.", "The feeble minded, of whom so much has lately been written, owing to the recent report of a Government Commission, belong to this group.", "They are distinguished from the more marked section of idiots in that they are not absolutely devoid of some intelligence, and are capable, under proper supervision, of some degree of self control.", "Some of them even can take part in industrial operations, though they require constant direction when so employed, and are never, even in the least serious cases, susceptible of mental development beyond a strangely and abruptly limited degree.", "Contrasted with the idiots are the lunatics; they often are gifted with the highest receptivity, and frequently are men or women of the highest education and intellect, normal in every feature of body and mind except that their mental machinery works in a defective, mad way as to one or more subjects—often only as to one subject or class of subjects.", "They exhibit in different individuals a vast variety of illusions and propensities which may be merely unreasonable or may be dangerous to themselves and to others.", "It seems that the idiotic and feeble minded are devoid of, or defective in, general mental receptivity, although in regard to a few things they may have retentive but unintelligent memory.", "Even the less afflicted among them are incapable of thinking at all, because their defective memory or receptivity gives them nothing to think about.", "On the other hand, the lunatic exhibits the ordinary receptivity of a healthy human being, but thinks wrongly or absurdly upon one or a few lines, though normally and soundly upon every other.", "The State in civilised countries has long since made provision for the proper medical care and restraint of lunatics and of the extreme cases of the other class, the idiots.", "But by an oversight in this country, which the gravedigger in _Hamlet_ would consider very natural, the less extreme cases of idiocy—the so called feeble minded—have been left without State guardianship.", "It is a fact that these cases occur both in the wealthiest and the poorest class of the community, though they are put away under medical care by well to do families, and are left by the very poor to wander about and get into terrible mischief.", "Hence there has grown up a belief that feeble minded offspring are more frequently produced by mentally sound parents who are very poor than by those who are rich or well to do, though there are not facts or figures which establish that conclusion.", "It has further been maintained that this supposed large proportional rate of production of feeble minded among the poorest, ill fed, ill housed, and vicious dregs of the community is due to the action of defective nutrition, alcoholism, and lack of fresh air and healthy occupation upon the parents, and that a deterioration of the reproductive material, a twist, as it were, of the inner substance of the stock or breed in the direction of feeble mindedness, has been thus established.", "In reply to this somewhat hasty but at first sight plausible conclusion, we maintain (1) that the definite defect called feeble mindedness is as common in well nourished, well to do families as in the poorest; (2) that it is not proved that lack of food and good air can act upon the germs contained in a parental animal, so as to alter it in such a way that the brain of offspring begotten by that parent will not develop in normal structure and proportion; and, moreover, that it has not been shown (that is the important clause of the statement) that defective food and air can so alter the germs in a parent as to cause other deformation or structural defect in the young which grow from those germs.", "It is, on the other hand, true that such defect of food and air may cause the death of the parent, or may directly cause the death of the young, if the young are subjected to such defective conditions of life.", "It is necessary to point out, in reply to those who hold the starvation theory, of feeble mindedness that it is capable of being handed on by hereditary transmission once it has appeared, and that in the most wretched groups of the population, both in cities and in country villages, the feeble minded are not taken in charge by any authority, but leave their parents and shift for themselves, and, owing to their weakness, accompanied by unrestrained animal desires, they become, in an irregular way and at a very early age, themselves the parents of feeble minded children.", "Thus feeble mindedness is increased in the poorest class, but not in that of the rich.", "The facts ascertained are too horrible and painful for citation here.", "The recent Commission has made it clear that it is absolutely necessary for the State to interfere and prevent this terrible increase of helpless imbeciles.", "There are eighty four schools in London for the education of children who are not included under the extreme terms idiots or imbeciles, but are feeble minded and defective. They are attended by 6000 children, of whom about two thirds learn some useful manual work, whilst the rest are hopeless, and require permanent custodial care—which at present is not to be had by those whose parents cannot pay for it—but will, there is every reason to hope, soon be provided for them by the State.", "In its absence they constitute a real and ghastly danger to the community, since some of them are certain to propagate their kind, and not only will thus add to the existing large body of imbeciles, but perpetuate the taint of feeble mindedness in the race.", "It is an interesting question as to whether there is a definite gap—a difference of kind between these poor, defective children and the markedly stupid boys and girls of some village schools.", "I am inclined to believe that there is.", "The one group does not pass by a gradual series into the other.", "It has been stated that in some remote country districts of England only one third of the school children can be taught more than the merest elements of writing, reading, and arithmetic; the majority are immovably dull, only the minority are as bright as ordinary London children.", "But even the dull village children get so far as to master the elements of learning, and probably their brains are not structurally defective, but only inactive for the time being.", "They may hereafter become village Hampdens.", "It certainly does seem to be the fact that the villages are continually deprived of the more intelligent members of their population by the attractions of the big towns, and that only the duller portion stay to breed in the village like the blind animals in a cave.", "But dullness is not identical with feeble mindedness.", "It is maintained that even in towns the multiplication of the hard working, cautious, and capable section of the community is at a standstill.", "Its members seek comfort, intellectual exercise, and self culture; they refuse to deprive themselves of these things, which cost money, and to spend that money on bringing up large families.", "On the other hand, the far more numerous working class has no such ambition as a rule, and no anxiety as to what is to become of its offspring, however numerous.", "The more children the larger are the earnings of the family, and all in turn shift for themselves at an early age.", "The rates pay for such education as they require, and their parents have no desire to push them up the social ladder; but food, lodging, and clothes cost money.", "The working man who desires to read, see things for himself, and be more than an animated cog on a wheel, cannot afford to have children and transmit to them that modicum of intelligence above the average which distinguishes him from his fellows, and demands for its cultivation the money with which he might keep a large family.", "Consequently the population is more and more largely replenished by the unenterprising poor and the unenterprising rich; the group which is enterprising and capable, and directs the work and thought of the civilised world, is, by the very qualities which make the increase of its strain desirable, debarred from contributing its fair proportion to the increase of the population.", "Is it possible for the community, by any system or by legislation, to overcome or evade this unfortunate tendency?", "The neglect by both the local and central government to provide any supervision of feeble minded children has had a special result of a strange and unhappy description.", "Let me hasten to say that now that we have secured by recent legislation the vitally important medical inspection of children in connection with Board schools, and the registration and official inspection of feeble minded children which will surely be made compulsory before another year has passed, the danger of which I am about to speak will very shortly no longer exist.", "It is this.", "Feeble minded children (whose condition falls short of that of actual idiocy) are almost impossible to manage as members of an ordinary family or household.", "Their condition is often not properly recognised; their parents or guardians find them to be obstinate, unteachable, and dirty.", "Often, when the family is poor, they are, under these circumstances, boarded out for a very small payment, or even taken charge of, out of charity.", "None of the persons concerned in these transactions know that they are dealing with a hopelessly unteachable child, born with this defective brain.", "They find scolding has no effect in guiding the child, mild chastisement fails, and the poor ignorant foster parent (sometimes even the child’s own mother) becomes exasperated and determined to subdue what seems to be mere obstinacy and indifference.", "The awful demon of cruelty is let loose.", "What seems at first a virtuous determination to control and regulate the child’s behaviour for its own good leads to the infliction upon it of blows of savage violence, then to the less dangerous but revolting attempt to enforce obedience by the pain caused by a burn, and to starvation as a final instrument of discipline.", "A very large number of the cases of cruelty to children and adolescents which from time to time are brought into the law courts have their origin in the fact that the victim was feeble minded, and that the guardian found guilty of cruelty did not (any more than do the judge and jury) understand or, indeed, know anything at all about such a condition.", "Often the feeble mindedness itself has been attributed to the cruel treatment of the child, whereas the latter really was set going by the former.", "To a large extent the community is to blame for allowing feeble minded children to be boarded out except in proper medical institutions, guaranteed and inspected by State authority.", "It is the same story as that which was once common enough in regard to lunatics, but has now been put an end to by the law.", "The boarding out of children, whether healthy or weak minded, should in all cases be illegal, except under proper official sanction and guarantee.", "It is not only for the sake of the children that this provision is necessary.", "It is certain that foolish people have been led, in the absence of all restraint and interference by public authority, to undertake without evil intention the care of discarded children, and have been led on by the hopeless dullness and obstinacy of a child with defective brain into cruel treatment of it; and when in some cases the child has died as the natural consequence of its congenital feebleness, the miserable guardians have been found guilty of causing its death.", "Though little excuse can be made for such miscreants, it is greatly to be desired that the law should step in at an earlier period, and both ensure proper care for the feeble minded child and remove from unqualified guardians the chance of developing from a state of mere ignorance into one of criminal responsibility.", "The Government Commission on the Treatment of the Feeble Minded, which has recently reported, has adopted the view which I have explained in this article as to the origin of feeble mindedness.", "A large amount of evidence was taken by the Commission from medical experts and others.", "A certain number of the witnesses maintained the opinion that feeble mindedness arises from the action of deficiency of food, of overcrowding, and possibly of drunkenness upon individuals of healthy strain, whose offspring, as a consequence, exhibit feeble mindedness.", "Some naturalists, who have committed themselves to a pious belief in what is vaguely called the transmission of acquired characters, think themselves called upon to support this opinion, in consequence of a notion that their belief would be rendered more reasonable than it is at present were such an origin of feeble mindedness demonstrated.", "Apart from the fact that it is not demonstrated, it is difficult to see how, supposing it were, such a causation could be considered as a transmission of an acquired character.", "The ill fed, drunken parent of a feeble minded child (when discovered and examined) is not found to have acquired a condition of the brain agreeing with that of his or her feeble minded offspring, though sometimes such parent is found to have been himself or herself born with a defective brain.", "No theory of organic memory, of engrams, inscripts, or transfer of molecular vibrations can enable us to present a plausible mechanical scheme of the way in which the acquired general condition (restricting ourselves to what is new and acquired) of an ill fed parent can be definitely and specifically re embodied in his or her offspring, as the peculiar structural condition of brain which is called feeble mindedness. It has not been shown, so far as I am aware, that privation in regard to the food of a parental organism gives rise to new congenital qualities in the reproductive germs which that organism throws off.", "XXX  DEATH RATES   The chief index or measure of the health of any locality is what is called the death rate of that locality.", "Although there are several other important evidences as to the healthiness or unhealthiness of any given area, the death rate is the chief and most obvious indication of the advantageous or disadvantageous action of the conditions of any given city or other chosen area upon human life.", "Its records are more easily kept with an approach to accuracy than are records of cases of sickness not terminating in death.", "The cause of death has to be certified in civilised communities by a medical man; the total number of deaths in a year is given by the number of burial certificates.", "The death rate is stated at so many per thousand of the population per annum.", "Thus, in a city of 5 million inhabitants,—that is to say, 5 thousand thousands—a record of eighty thousand deaths in the year gives 16 deaths for every thousand persons living.", "That is called an annual death rate of 16. The record for any single month may be stated (as it is stated at intervals in the newspapers) as at the rate of so many in the thousand per annum, by multiplying the actual monthly number per thousand by 12.", "Thus, in the case of the city just cited, if the death rate were the same in every month of the year—namely, 16—it would mean that 6500 persons died regularly every month.", "But we should probably find that in some month or other as few as 5417 persons died.", "That would be reported as at the rate of 13 per thousand per annum; since, if every month gave only 5417 deaths, we should get 65,000 deaths a year, which works out at 13 in the thousand in a population of 5 millions.", "In other months it might run as high as 19 or 20 (representing over 8000 deaths a month), although, taking all the months together, the deaths are at the rate of 16 in the thousand for the year.", "The bald statement of the death rate, of course, admits of much analysis where proper records are kept.", "Thus the death rate from different diseases and groups of diseases can be stated, and the death rate in each group at different ages and for the two sexes can be given where proper records are kept.", "In this country the records of population in various areas and for the whole country, and of the deaths from various causes, and at different ages, are collected and tabulated by the Registrar General and his officials.", "The annual reports issued by him show what an amazing progress has been made in increasing the security of life in our great cities within the last fifty years.", "Thus, in London, the death rate was, fifty years ago, 24 in the thousand.", "In 1906 it was only 15.1 in the thousand—it has gradually fallen, year by year, so that now it is less than two thirds of what it was half a century ago.", "In Manchester and Liverpool it was about 26 twenty years ago, and has fallen to 19 in Manchester and to a little over 20 in Liverpool.", "In the same period the improvement has been (omitting fractions) from 19 to 14 in Bristol; from 20 to 16 in Birmingham; from 20 to 14 in Leicester.", "This great diminution in the death rate has been coincident with the expenditure of public funds on the improvement of the water supply and the sewage arrangements of those cities, as well as with the enforcement of regulations to prevent overcrowding, and with the demolition of the most insanitary houses.", "Rules as to the removal of filth from the neighbourhood of dwelling houses have been obeyed, and sick persons suffering from infectious diseases have been removed from dwelling houses and conveyed to special hospitals.", "There is no doubt that the diminished death rate is due to the action thus taken, and more will be done in the future to the same end.", "The proper provision of pure milk (at a reasonable price) for the food of the youngest children, of regular meals for older children, and the protection of adults from the too frequent inducement to indulge in the use of distilled spirits, will be taken in hand by the municipalities, and lead to a further diminution in the death rate.", "We may, indeed, soon have to ask whether, in a population which has become so much less subject to diminution by death than was formerly the case, there is not too great an increase by birth—too great, that is to say, for the existing means of employment and food production.", "A most serious, indeed, an alarming fact, has recently come to light in the study of this question, namely, that the increase of the population is due (as pointed out on p.", "279) to the proportionately larger number of births amongst the poorer, and even destitute, sections of the community who have not the means of training and rearing their children satisfactorily, and are themselves likely to transmit incapacity of one kind and another to their offspring; whilst those who have valuable hereditary qualities and are prosperous have—it is clearly established—relatively few children—and, in fact, do not increase the population.", "Whether this condition of things constitutes a real danger, how it will ultimately work out if left alone, and how the difficulty is to be met, are problems for statesmen which cannot be solved off hand, but require knowledge not only of the crude facts of statistics, but also of the causes at work.", "Scientific knowledge—that is to say, thorough and unassailable knowledge—of the laws of heredity, of psychology, and of the natural history of human populations, are among the essential qualifications for those who have to face and deal with this difficult matter.", "And who is there who has this knowledge or is even trying to obtain it?", "Not the State in this country or its officials  for in every department of government (however capable some of the subordinates may be) there is a determined opposition to and fear of Science on the part of the political and highly paid chiefs—the jealous fear due to complete and deadly ignorance.", "XXXI  GOSSAMER   Fine as gossamer!", "Town bred folks never see it, and do not believe in its existence;

It seems probable that these movements are made in order to bring the capsule from an exposed position when it falls on to the ground—where it might be crushed or eaten by some animal—into a position of shelter, either into a hole, or under some stone or fallen wood.", "The warmth of the sun in an exposed position excites the caterpillar to activity, which ceases when it has reached the shade offered by some protecting cranny.", "In the same way I have applied artificial heat and, alternatively, shelter from heat, so as to cause the movements or the resting of the jumping bean in a London sitting room.", "These things and others of absorbing interest may be seen in the truly wonderful museum of Kew Gardens, where perhaps the visitor will be disposed to spend more time in cold weather than in the summer.", "The park at Kew Gardens, with its splendid forest and lakes, and its Italian tower, is one of the beautiful things of England, and it has a special quality even in this season of mist and veiled sunshine.", "I found there recently, under the trees, as I did fifty years ago, a rare and strange looking fungus, the _Phallus impudicus_ of botanists,—a furtive denizen of the glades which in late spring are purple with wild hyacinths.", "The same spot in June presents within a few minutes’ journey from the smoke and smell and noise of Piccadilly a perfect sample of what is, perhaps, the most beautiful sight in Nature—bright sunlight breaking through the young green leaves of a forest on to green herbage.", "And close by are the azaleas!", "XXXIII  PROTECTIVE COLOURING IN ANIMALS   Every one is familiar with some of the instances in which the natural colour of an animal helps to hide it from view.", "Green caterpillars, for instance, are less visible when among the green leaves which they eat than they would be were they brown, blue, red, yellow, or black.", "The little green tree frog is difficult to see when he is clinging to a leaf, because his colour is the same as that of the leaf.", "Sandy brown coloured animals, birds, reptiles, and beasts of prey, are found on the sands of the desert; white birds, foxes, hares, and bears on the Arctic snow.", "The similarity of the colouring of these animals to that of the ground on which they live results in their escaping the observation of man’s eye, and we are entitled to believe that they escape for the same reason the observation of other animals.", "They are thus in many cases protected from the attacks of enemies searching for them as prey, or in other cases they may themselves be enabled the more easily in consequence of their concealing colour to creep upon other animals and seize them as food.", "Some of the simpler cases of this resemblance between an animal and its surroundings are easy to observe, and the value of the resemblance as protection, or as a means of secret attack, is plain enough.", "But there are far more numerous cases in which the significance of colour as concealment, is not so immediately obvious.", "There are the curious stick insects, with long bodies and delicate long legs, sometimes with bud like knobs on the body which look like bits of the branches of trees, not merely on account of their colour, but on account of their shape.", "Shape or modelling has a great deal to do with the effective concealment of an animal.", "Then, too, there is the curious fact that some insects (and also some birds) when at rest on the stems of trees, are practically invisible, but if they spread their wings are conspicuous.", "The beech leaf butterfly of Assam and Africa is of a purple colour, marked with a great orange coloured bar on each fore wing when the wings are open, and it is obvious enough.", "But when the wings are closed and the insect is at rest, the undersides only are seen, and are coloured so as to represent the veining and fungus marks of a dry brown leaf, so that not even a human observer, let alone a bird or a lizard, can distinguish at two feet distance the butterfly from dried leaves placed near it.", "A well known little moth, with pale green mottled wings, is the only case in which I have myself watched the protection afforded by colour at work.", "It was on a summer’s evening, when I saw this little moth zigzagging up and down with the most extraordinarily irregular flight, and a bird pursuing it.", "Twice the bird swooped and just missed his prey owing to a sudden turn and drop on the part of the moth.", "And then to my great delight the moth flopped against the stem of a tree on which was growing a greenish grey lichen.", "The bird swooped again close to the tree, but failed to see the insect, and quitted the chase.", "It took me an appreciable time to detect the little moth resting against the lichen, and closely matching it in colour.", "There are endless examples known of such protective resemblances, some of them (such as that of the buff tip moth, which, with its wings closed, looks like a broken birch twig) being most unexpected and fascinating.", "In the forests of Madagascar, the whitish grey tree lichens are imitated by thread like growths on beetles, tree bugs, locusts, and even lizards, with a wonderful concealing effect, and some other flat membrane like insects are so much like the greenish and yellowish bark of trees, that we actually lost a specimen for some time in the case labelled Mimicry, in which a series of these things was arranged by me for the edification of visitors to the Natural History Museum.", "It was found, after a day or two, to have been present all the time with other specimens on a piece of bark, from which it was indistinguishable.", "Some eight years ago a distinguished American painter, Mr.", "Abbott Thayer, was able to add very importantly to our knowledge of the ways in which colour serves to conceal animals when in their natural surroundings.", "Mr.", "Thayer was able to do this owing to the fact that he was a devoted student of woodland life.", "This, however, alone was not enough.", "Mr.", "Thayer had the special ability to deal with this subject which comes from the trained eye of an artist.", "He had, above all, the knowledge of tone values and of the illusive and delusive effects of false shading and of colour spots and bars, and of complementary colours and irradiation—which only a painter who deals every day in the most practical way with these matters can attain to.", "Mr.", "Thayer showed eight years ago—and demonstrated conclusively by means of models, one of which he presented to the Natural History Museum at my request—that in very many cases it is of no use for an animal to be of the same colour as its surroundings, since if the animal (a bird, or a quadruped, or a fish) is of plump and rounded shape and is observed under the open canopy of heaven, a deep shadow will exist on its lower surface and make it as obvious as a shaded charcoal drawing on a piece of light brown paper.", "But if the back of the animal is of a dark tint and its belly white or whitish, then the effect of light and shade is (Mr.", "Thayer showed) completely counteracted and the animal becomes totally invisible in its natural surroundings.", "Mr.", "Thayer’s model demonstrating this consists of two life size wooden models of ducks seated on a stick—one to the left, the other to the right.", "The stick, with the two models on it, is fixed horizontally in a box, which is open above (that is, has no lid) and is also open in front.", "The box is, in fact, a little stage, lit from above by the light of the sky, and its three remaining sides are sufficiently high to form a complete background to the model ducks, whose perch runs across the scene at some 7 in.", "or 8 in.", "from the floor of the box.", "The box itself is lined with a pale purplish brown flannel, and each bird is tightly covered with the same material.", "When so prepared the box is placed on a table under a skylight (where it is to stay), the table being high enough to bring the ducks just below the line of sight.", "Of course, deep shadows are formed by the top light on the under side of the beak, head, and body of the models, and in spite of their colour being itself identical with that of the walls of the box, they are as obvious as it is possible for anything to be.", "Now Mr.", "Thayer takes his paints and very carefully darkens the back of one of the ducks and whitens its belly and the under side of its head and beak.", "The light and dark regions merge into one another along the side of the bird by skilful gradation.", "When this shading and whitening is finished (and, of course, the perfection of the result depends on the continuance of the right amount of sunlight, which is not a thing one can always ensure in a London museum) the duck model so treated is absolutely invisible at a distance of 10 ft.", "or 15 ft.—and even when one is nearer escapes notice—looking like a haze or vague shadow of a bird even to an observer who knows nevertheless that it is there and is really as solid and large as the untreated model by its side.", "If now some one stretches out his hand so as to cut off the top light falling on the painted model, it immediately becomes as solid to the eye as the untreated one, and when the hand is withdrawn it melts away again like Banquo’s ghost.", "The models made by Mr.", "Thayer were, so long as I was director, exhibited in the small room between the fish gallery and the central hall of the Natural History Museum, and, if they have not yet been removed, are well worth a visit.", "Mr.", "Thayer’s models work perfectly, and astonish every one who sees them.", "The great point of interest about them, however, is, that the bird with dark back and light belly is really in the condition which is quite common in a number of birds, especially ducks and wading birds, where it must act as a means of concealing the bird—just as it does in the painted model.", "Of course, there are vast numbers of birds not so shaded, but it is possible to explain the darker and lighter colouring, in various arrangements seen in birds, as helping to produce concealment or disappearance from view, when the habits and natural surroundings of the bird are known.", "So, too, with many hairy quadrupeds (mammals, or animals, or beasts, as they are often called).", "The white hair under the tail and about the rump, helps a running animal to escape the vision of its pursuer—blending, as Mr.", "Thayer shows that it does—with the white colour of the sky line.", "In the case of fish—especially fresh water fish—the dark back and light belly are very common, and although they do not help to conceal the fish when seen from above, swimming over a light coloured river bed, yet when looked at by other fishes or by otters in the water, the effect of the light from above on this disposition of dark and light tints on the fish’s body must be the same as that demonstrated by Mr.", "Thayer’s disappearing duck, and must often render the fish absolutely invisible, even at close quarters.", "Mr.", "Thayer has pursued this subject during the past seven years, and last autumn he gave some interesting demonstrations in the Zoological Gardens in London.", "He showed a model of a white egret, which was but little noticeable when standing up clear against a bright, white clouded sky.", "The long plumes on the wings, developed in the breeding season, were shown (by putting them on and taking them off) to assist in causing invisibility, since they made the side of the body flat and concealed the shadow on its rounded underside.", "A similar bird model marked with strong black on the neck and legs—the rest being white—refused (so to speak) to shape itself as a bird at all, and looked at a distance of twenty yards like a bit of rock or stump of wood with a twig and dead leaf attached.", "The effect of different tones of brown cardboard cut into the form of a butterfly, when seen on different backgrounds, was shown; but the most interesting experiment was made with a black green piece of cloth cut to the shape of a butterfly and fastened on to a sheet of dead black cloth in the open air, in the presence of white cloud light of moderate brilliancy.", "At five yards one could see the outline of the dark green butterfly shaped piece; at fifteen yards one could just distinguish the edge separating the dark green piece from the black cloth.", "Now Mr.", "Thayer stuck in the middle of the dark green butterfly wing a small circle of pure white (about one third of an inch across).", "The effect was entirely to obliterate the previously visible edge; one could no longer see the dark green area at all—one only saw a white spot on a continuous dark ground, the dark green and the black were merged into one.", "That is no doubt due to the powerful stimulation of the sensitive retina of the eye by the white light of the spot; the feeble stimulation by the dark green and black, though these remain physically as distinct from one another as before, ceases to affect the brain, which is, as it were, entirely occupied with the strong white spot.", "This, according to Mr.", "Thayer, is the value to butterflies and other animals of a violently contrasted white spot or band on a dark general colouring.", "The fringe of white dots and connected white flakes nearer the centre of the wing—common on the wings of butterflies—has, similarly, the result of rendering the wing outline imperceptible and the butterfly invisible.", "Many such relations of colour spots and bands, as well as of dark and light markings, have been elucidated by Mr.", "Thayer, and will be illustrated by coloured drawings in the book which he is preparing on the subject.", "While it is the fact that Mr.", "Thayer has thrown new light on the colour protection and invisibility of animals, it must be remembered that there are other explanations of certain cases of brilliant colouring in animals besides that which he has so well illustrated.", "Warning colours, recognition marks, and sexually attractive colouring all certainly and demonstrably exist in well known and well studied kinds of animals.", "It is very possible that some of these colour markings have been produced by a slight change in what were previously concealing patterns or colour markings.", "The tendency of the human observer is to regard any colour, spot, or pattern on a bird, fish, beast, or insect as a mark or distinguishing sign. We examine these things at close quarters, and do not, unless we reflect a good deal on the matter and experiment with the object, realise that what is a mark of distinction or recognition when seen at a few inches’ distance may be an illusive and obscuring colour scheme when seen at a distance of some feet, and in natural and habitual surroundings.", "It is not unlikely that we shall arrive at definite knowledge of the psychological sight interpretations of animals by a further study of this subject.", "It is in the highest degree probable that the retinal picture produced in an animal’s eye by certain spots of colour, shade, and light exhibited by another animal, are not interpreted by the receptive animal in the same way as they would be by a scrutinising, inquiring, reasoning man, even one who is what we call a savage. Moreover, though many English naturalists have travelled and seen life and light in the sunny regions of the earth, there are few students of the colour markings of animals in our museums, especially in great cities, who have adequate experience of what colour markings really can effect in the way of concealment and illusion when light and surrounding objects are as they are, in the tropics or sub tropical regions.", "It is a fashion nowadays in the best provided museums of natural history to exhibit stuffed beasts, birds, and insects in what are called their natural surroundings. The fatal objection to such exhibitions is that were the beasts, birds, and insects placed in their most usual natural surroundings, they would be invisible!", "It is the merit of Mr.", "Thayer to have drawn attention to these considerations, and to have carried out some interesting demonstrations of the more frequent significance of colour markings as means of concealment and illusion than had been recognised before his work.", "At the same time, it is not possible to consider the yellow and black livery of wasps, of certain evil tasting grubs, and of poisonous salamanders as anything but a danger flag, a warning to other animals that the yellow and black animal had better not be bitten and tasted.", "So the previous experience of animals who have bitten yellow and black creatures is appealed to, and ensures the safety of the yellow and black gentry from tentative bites which would kill them.", "Other recognition marks by which ill tasting, nauseous butterflies are distinguished, and in consequence of which they escape attack, and, not only that, but are mimicked (as the yellow and black poisonous wasp is mimicked by some innocuous flies which thus escape attack) by other pleasant tasting butterflies which fly with them, are considered by Mr.", "Thayer to be wrongly interpreted as recognition or warning marks.", "He shows, with more or less success, that the markings of the butterflies known as Heliconiæ are effective as concealment, and is therefore inclined to deny their value as warning marks, serving to indicate a noxious quarry best left untasted.", "It is, of course, quite possible that what are concealment markings when viewed by an aggressive bird or lizard at a distance, may be recognised as warning marks when seen by the same observers at close quarters, and it is also possible that the latter may have become the more important or only important result of the colour marks of a given butterfly which were once useful as concealment. The possible change of significance of colour spots and markings in wild animals may be illustrated by the effect on human beings of the burglar’s crêpe mask.", "At the present moment probably the most prominent result of the appearance in a house full of people in the dead of night of a man with a crêpe mask over his face would be terror to those who saw him.", "The mask would be interpreted as a mark or sign of evil, not to say violent intentions on the part of the masked man.", "It would be a warning colour, and most unathletic individuals would severely avoid it; in fact, retire from it in alarm.", "But actually, the burglar’s mask—as possibly some noxious insects’ distinctive markings—was not invented for the purpose of causing alarm.", "Far from it!", "The burglar, or nocturnal malefactor, dons his crêpe mask in order to cover the white glitter of his face, and so to escape observation.", "In origin it is a protective coloration leading to invisibility, and only secondarily has it become a warning colour or mark at close quarters.", "There will be much more ascertained, and much instructive discussion as to the colours and markings of not only animals, but also of flowers and foliage, before this wonderful subject is thrashed out.", "I have only been able here to indicate its outlines.", "XXXIV  HOP BLIGHT   Hops have for many years now been a very uncertain investment for those who, in England, devote capital to the growing, drying, and marketing of this crop.", "In some years a fortune may be made, in some years a dead loss, in many a bare return of expenditure.", "Hence, it is not surprising that English hop growers should wish for legislation which shall make their business more secure by taxing the hops produced in other countries, and imported by our brewers.", "The whole subject of hops is a very complicated one.", "It is the fact that every plant and animal cultivated by civilised man has led to the accumulation of an astonishing amount of detailed knowledge and experience in each case, and that there are increasing difficulties and surprises in regard to varieties, and the competition of new supplies brought from all quarters of the globe.", "New areas of cultivation, new methods of transport, new fashion and taste continually disturb, and even destroy, old established industries.", "It is for statesmen to consider how far the remorseless current of unforeseen changes should be checked and manipulated, so as to prevent disaster in the old established and flourishing industries of the countryside.", "The hop (called _Humulus lupulus_ by botanists) is a native of this country, and of the more temperate parts of Europe.", "The Greeks and Romans never made beer, and were unacquainted with the use of the hop.", "More than a thousand years ago the German and Scandinavian peoples made use of various fragrant herbs (sweet gale, bark of tamarisk and oak) to flavour the sweet beer which they brewed from malted grain, just as borage, cucumber, and other plants are still used to flavour cups. Wild hops were used, amongst other herbs, for this purpose, and gradually—but only gradually—became the favourite source of flavour.", "The hop owes its selection not merely to its bitter tonic quality, but also to its wonderful and most delicate perfume.", "Not only that, but the hop is found to be effective in checking continued fermentation and souring—and also to have a narcotic sleep producing quality, for which it is still used medicinally.", "Distinct chemical compounds are found in hops to which these several properties are due.", "A warm hop pillow—a pillow stuffed with dried hop flowers—has given, and still gives, sleep to many a wakeful countryman.", "The older use of other fragrant plants in the making of beer survives in some foreign beers, such as the Norwegian ale, the beer of Louvain, and the green spruce beer of Jena.", "Hops were first cultivated with a view to obtaining varieties which would furnish abundant and large, well flavoured flower heads.", "The flower heads are cones, consisting of numerous minute flowers, protected by overlapping green coloured scales or bracts.", "The cultivated hop was brought to this country in the time of Henry VIII, and the cultivation of hops in hop gardens and the skilful drying of the flower heads in large bulk was commenced, and regulated by law.", "The male or pollen producing hop vine is distinct from the female seed bearing hop vine; it is the female flower cone which carries the valuable fragrant and resinous products which the brewer desires.", "Hops are artificially propagated by root cuttings, and it is interesting to note that the hop grower finds that it is not desirable to allow the female flowers to be fertilised, since, although the hops weigh more after the setting of the seed, the valuable extractive substances contained in the flower are diminished, used up in the growth of the seed.", "Hence, often only one male hop vine to every 200 female hop vines is allowed in a hop garden.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "55.—Early winged female hop louse, produced viviparously by the first generation of daughters of the Foundress, Fig.", "58.", "These winged females migrate from the plum tree, where they were born, to the hop vines by aid of their wings, and produce viviparously the form drawn in Fig.", "57.]", "[Illustration  FIG.", "56.—Male hop louse, not appearing until late autumn.]", "It does not follow because a plant is a native of a given country that it can be easily cultivated anywhere in that country, or that its finest cultivated varieties will be hardy.", "Only a few limited territories (owing to the nature of the soil, climate, and exposure) in Germany (chiefly in Bavaria), and in Kent, Sussex, Worcestershire, and Herefordshire, seem to be really favourable to hop growing in Europe.", "Certain parts of the Pacific coast of the United States have of late years proved a very successful ground, although hops were introduced from Europe and first cultivated with considerable success in the State of New York.", "The same dangers and troubles attend the hop crop in all these regions.", "These are blight, red spider, mildew and mould, besides several less important insect pests.", "The hop blight, or black blight, is a plant louse or aphis (Fig.", "55) like the rose aphis, and does great and increasing damage to the hop crop in England, destroying the young and tender shoots in the months of June and July.", "In 1882 the hop crop was reduced from 459,000 cwt.", "(of the preceding year) to 115,000 cwt.", "by this insect, and the wages paid for hop picking from £350,000 to £150,000.", "These figures give an idea both of the damage done by blight and of the amount and value of the annual crop, for the mere picking of which so large a payment is made.", "Red spider is a small mite or acarid which has done a good deal of damage in Kent.", "But mildew and mould are more serious.", "These are due to a delicate, thread like kind of fungus, which spreads on the leaf.", "Many kinds are known in various parts of the world and on various plants.", "They may grow on one kind of plant without doing injury to it, but if they get on to another, cause deadly destruction of the foliage.", "It was an otherwise harmless mould, or leaf fungus, which destroyed the coffee plantations of Ceylon.", "It had lived in the Ceylon forests on other plants without attracting notice; but when the coffee tree was introduced and cultivated in large areas, this little fungus seized on it, grew with terrible activity, and received the name vastatrix from the botanists who traced its history, and showed that it was the destroyer of the coffee plantations.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "57.—Ordinary wingless female hop louse, multiplying parthenogenetically throughout the summer.]", "Hop growers are constantly contending with these pests in the same way as other growers of crops have to contend with similar pests, but the hop growers have the more difficult and delicate patient to steer through its diseases.", "The finest kinds of hops are not robust;

In Germany (where the highest priced hops are produced) small cultivators dry them in the sun, and they are cured by the purchaser, but in England they are dried in kilns (called oasts in Kent) near the hop grounds.", "They are cured with sulphur fumes on the spot as soon as dried.", "The object of the drying and curing is quickly to get rid of the water, which forms 75 per cent.", "of the weight of the green flower heads, but is reduced by drying to 10 per cent., and to destroy the mould (fungus) which may be present, and to keep the hops free from new access of mould by the slight deposit of

treating the freshly gathered flower cones.", "It is said that it takes years to acquire the art, and that skilled hop curers are more difficult to obtain than formerly.", "The natural difficulties and fluctuations with which the English hop grower has to contend are made far more serious by the fact that he does not know what will be the yield of the American and German hop plantations, and so cannot prepare beforehand for the demands of the market.", "It appears that ice storage is now being made use of in some districts to hold over any excess of produce of particular kinds of hop beyond the special demand for those kinds.", "But a formidable source of trouble exists (and, it appears, must always exist) in the enormous changes and expansion of the brewing industry in all parts of the globe.", "It is actually the case that there has been a greatly increased and unforeseen demand for hops of less highly developed aroma, for the purpose of brewing light ales with little of the perfume given by the finest and hitherto most highly priced hops.", "So that, having expended skill and money to produce the finest hops, and having been favoured by the weather, a grower may find that his pains have been thrown away, and that there is a sudden falling off in the demand for the beautiful high priced crop which he has gathered in.", "There is no remedy for these world wide fluctuations in the market, and the only way in which the grower can protect himself is by combining with others to procure information from every part of the world as to the probable production and the probable demand of the various qualities of hops a year or more in advance of his planting.", "More has been done in America and in Germany in this way than in England, and it is probable that the future success or failure of hop growing in this country depends more on the possibility of obtaining correct information in regard to the tendencies of production in all hop growing countries, and in regard to the demand in all the brewing industries of the world, than on anything else.", "This brief sketch of the hop growing industry is sufficient to show what a very difficult problem is before those who desire to take legislative measures for the preservation of the old industry of the hop garden in this country.", "But it must not be at once assumed, because the case is a difficult and complicated one, that nothing can be done, and that the beautiful hop vines and the finest hops are necessarily to be banished from the English soil.", "XXXV  GREEN FLIES, PLANT LICE, AND PARTHENOGENESIS   The minute green flies which attack all kinds of plants, and among which are ranked the hop louse or hop blight, the rose aphis or green fly of rose trees, the woolly blight or aphis of apple trees and pear trees, and the terrible vine killer—the _Phylloxera vastatrix_—form a special group of bug like insects known as the Aphides.", "They have soft cylindrical bodies, six legs, sometimes two pairs of transparent wings, sometimes none, and a sharp beak (in some kinds this is one and a half times as long as the body), with which they prick the soft parts of plants, when they suck up the juices which issue from the wound (Fig.", "59).", "There is in the temperate regions of the world a special kind of aphis or plant louse peculiar to each of many kinds of flowering plants, including most trees.", "A very complete, illustrated account of the kinds or species of British aphides, amounting to some two hundred, was produced by the late Mr.", "Buckton, F.R.S., and published by the Ray Society.", "There are many facts of extraordinary interest about these tiny swarming insects.", "In the first place, they are closely related to the minute scale insects or _Coccidæ_, several species of which produce the celebrated lac of lacquer work and the dyes known as lake, cochineal, and kermes, the latter a dye manufactured in South Europe and used to colour wool and cloth crimson before cochineal reached us from Mexico.", "The _Coccidæ_ include also the mussel scale and other destructive diseases of fruit trees.", "A beautiful purple colour can be extracted from crushed masses of some kinds of aphides (as well as from _Coccidæ_), and has been used as a dye.", "The aphides have very generally a green colour, like many insects (caterpillars and leaf insects) which pass their lives upon green leaves and feed on them.", "It is often supposed that this green colour is merely the green colouring matter (so called chlorophyll) of the leaf, taken up by the insects in feeding on the leaf.", "But this is not so; it is a peculiar substance derived in a crude state from the plant juice, but digested in the stomach and completed in the insects’ blood and tissues.", "Then, again, the aphides produce curious secretions, often in great abundance, which surround them as the lac surrounds the lac insect.", "The threads which are produced in such abundance, by the woolly aphis of apple trees, as to look like masses of cotton wool adhering to the twigs of the tree, are of this nature.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "58.—Foundress or stock mother of the hop

the body in the drawings of the hop louse (Figs.", "55 to 59).", "The ant is causing the aphis to pour out its honey dew (in fact milking it) by drumming on the body of the plant louse with its clubbed antennæ, and has taken the drop of honey dew between its jaws.", "This drawing was made from life by the late Mr.", "Buckton, F.R.S., a great student of these creatures.", "The ant is that kind known as _Myrinica rubra_.", "The plant louse is the _Aphis sambuci_ or blight of the elder tree.]", "Another curious production of the aphides—common on the leaves of elms and other trees infested by them—is known as honey dew. It is sticky and sweet, and was supposed by old writers to have distilled from the stars, or otherwise to have dropped from heaven.", "It is this sweet secretion which has led to the establishment of a most curious friendship between ants and aphides, or plant lice.", "It has long been known that an ant will approach an aphis, and tickle it, when at once the aphis exudes from its cornicles (see Fig.", "60) a drop of sweet honey dew, which the ant swallows—just as a man may milk a cow and drink the milk.", "And the resemblance goes further, for the ants take possession of certain aphides, and keep them either underground or in specially constructed chambers, where they can gain ready access to them and milk them for honey dew.", "There has been a certain amount of exaggeration in the description of these facts by some of the older writers; but it is undoubtedly true that some species of ants keep special flocks or herds of aphides, and feed on their sweet secretion.", "Other small insects nourish themselves on the enormous swarms of plant lice in a less gentle way, but a way which man is very glad to see in active operation, namely, by biting them and sucking out their soft entrails—thus destroying them in great numbers.", "The lady bird beetle is especially active in this matter, both when it is a grub and on attaining its adult form.", "A trustworthy observer saw as many as forty aphides consumed by a lady bird in an hour.", "Where the plant lice or aphides abound, there come also in countless swarms the beetles known as lady birds.", "In the year 1869, such a cloud of these beetles passed over and settled on the fields and gardens of Kent, Sussex, and Surrey, as to cause something like terror; it was impossible to walk in the lanes without crushing hundreds under foot.", "But the little lady birds are not like the terrible locust, which appears in millions and devours all vegetation before it; on the contrary, they are what are called beneficials, and come solely to feed on and destroy the plant lice of the hops, plum trees, and apple trees.", "A first rate hop crop in the year 1870 was the consequence of the abundance of lady birds in 1869.", "It is this beneficent activity of the lady birds which has given them their name.", "In Italy they are called _Bestioline del Signore_, also _Madonnine_, and _Marioline_, and in France _Bête à Dieu_.", "In English they are our lady’s blessed bugs, which save the crops from destruction.", "The exertions of the aphides in pricking the plants they infest so as to get at their juices lead to the growth of galls on the leaves, and also on the rootlets of many plants, and often the leaves become rolled up into bag like bodies filled with aphides.", "Many trees and smaller plants are killed by these attacks, but it is probable that where the plants have not been rendered delicate by nursing and cultivation, and where the aphides are not a strange foreign kind, introduced by man’s carelessness or by some rarely (if ever) occurring wind or flood, the aphides do not actually destroy any plants by their visitation, excepting the weaklings, and that their numbers are kept within bounds by their natural enemies the lady birds and other such carnivorous insects.", "We must now notice the most interesting of all the wonderful things which have been discovered about these tiny insects, which are even smaller than fleas.", "Any one who has a rose garden and chooses to spend some hours a day in studying the green fly can follow out the facts.", "They reproduce themselves—that is to say, propagate—with astounding rapidity.", "The great Linnæus, a hundred and fifty years ago, came to the conclusion, from his observation of one kind or species, that in one year a single aphis would produce a quintillion of descendants!", "Without insisting upon the exact numbers in different kinds of aphides, we may say that that is a fair indication of the rate at which they produce young.", "No sooner does a mother aphis produce some thirty or forty young, than in a few hours or days, according to the warmth of the season and the abundance of food, these young have grown to full size and themselves each produce the same number of young, and so on through the summer, and even into the autumn.", "Nineteen generations in sixteen weeks have been counted in some kinds of the plant lice.", "Hence it is no wonder that these little creatures increase exceedingly and cover the leaves and shoots on which they feed; no wonder that they furnish a plentiful nourishment for the lady birds which prey on them.", "But the most curious thing is this, that these abundant and rapidly reproducing broods of aphis are _all females_, and that they do not lay eggs, but extrude their young in a more or less complete state of development, that is to say, they are viviparous.", "They are all females!", "It is only late in the season that males are produced!", "In fact, the summer broods of the green fly and other aphides which do so much damage to rose bushes, hops, and other cultivated plants, are produced by females alone, without the intervention of a male.", "These minute insects present true instances of that very remarkable and interesting occurrence which is called parthenogenesis, or virginal propagation.", "It is further a noteworthy thing that the virginal aphis mothers do not lay or deposit eggs, but that the young grow from the eggs inside their mothers (Fig.", "61), and are only extruded when they are complete little six legged insects, capable of walking, and ready to feed themselves by stabbing the soft leaves of the plant on which they find themselves, and sucking up its juices.", "The summer aphides are spoken of as being both viviparous and parthenogenetic. The words are really useful, and we cannot get on without them.", "No case is known to medical men or to naturalists of the birth of young from an unimpregnated or virgin mother among what are called the higher animals—those which are classed as vertebrates, and include mankind, mammals, birds, reptiles, batrachians, and fishes.", "But though uncommon, this virginal reproduction (or parthenogenesis) does occur constantly in a very few kinds of small insects and in some small shrimp like creatures.", "It has excited the greatest interest amongst naturalists from the early days when it was first observed until the present, and it has been very carefully studied in the past thirty years.", "In order to appreciate this matter it is necessary to know the chief facts about the ordinary process of reproduction in animals and plants.", "All animals and plants are built up of minute particles of living matter called cells (see p.", "170).", "Really, these are not cells, or hollow boxes, or cases.", "We use the word cell for the contents of a cell.", "Each is a droplet of protoplasm or living matter lying in a small or large envelope or case of dead matter which it has produced around itself (Fig.", "61).", "Observers using their microscopes saw at first only the case, and called it a cell, and the word cell is now used almost universally for the soft stuff within the cell (see p.", "173).", "Each soft cell of plasm or protoplasm has a very special structure.", "The existence in it of a central kernel, or nucleus of peculiarly active substance, is the most obvious feature.", "These cells are so small (for instance, those which build up the human body) that from one to two thousand could be placed side by side on a line an inch long.", "They are the units which make up the body of an animal or plant, just as bricks and planks and rods make up a building constructed by human contrivance.", "Two most important things about them are—first, that each is always the seat of chemical activity, absorbing liquid material, changing it and either fixing it or throwing it out in a new chemical condition; and, second, that as a result each cell grows, and after a very little growth divides into two.", "This dividing into two is immensely important, for in this way the number of cells forming a very young or small animal or plant is increased from a few thousands to many millions whilst the organism grows.", "And not only that, but we find on tracing the young animal or plant back to its beginning as an individual that it actually started as a single cell.", "The germ of every living thing, then, is a single nucleated particle of protoplasm—a cell which we call the egg cell, because eggs are merely shells and packing to hold and protect this all important egg cell.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "61.—A single egg tube or ovarian tube (usually there are many) of an insect.", "The youngest and smallest eggs are at the narrow end.", "_o_ _o_ are larger egg cells with a striated shell or envelope; _g_, nucleus of the egg cell.", "The unshaded egg is one grown to full size, and in the parthenogenetic aphis would develop where it is without fertilisation into a young aphis.]", "Every individual flower, tree, insect, snail, fish, and man started as a single egg cell, which became detached from the mother’s body.", "Take the case of a common marine animal, the star fish.", "At the breeding season, early in the year, the female star fish discharges thousands of these egg cells into the sea water.", "Each floats separately in a delicate case of its own.", "Before any one of those floating egg cells can commence to divide so as to build up a new mass of cells—a new young star fish—it must undergo the process of fertilisation.

the sperm cells are, in such cases, received into a chamber of the egg producing parent’s body, and there the fusion of the egg cells with them, one sperm cell to one egg cell, takes place.", "Parthenogenesis then consists in the omission of the fusion of a sperm cell with the egg cell.", "The egg cell develops, divides again and again, and produces the young animal without the addition to it of a sperm cell—without, in fact, being fertilised, as it is called.", "That is what happens in the summer broods of the little plant lice or aphides (Fig.", "57).", "When, however, the cold weather comes the virgin mothers suddenly produce two kinds of young—males as well as females—and then the solitary winter egg, which the late autumn females lay to last through winter until spring, is fertilised by a sperm cell derived from the late produced autumn male (Fig.", "56) in the ordinary way.", "Another parthenogenetic animal is the rare little fresh water shrimp called _Apus_, which goes on multiplying in this manner in wayside ponds for years, thousands of female individuals being produced in successive seasons, laying their eggs and carrying on the race for an indefinite time until at last—one fine day—we do not know why then and not before, that rare creature a male _Apus_ is hatched.", "Why these and one or two other such small shrimps and insects are able to set aside the almost universal law as to the necessity for fertilisation of the egg cell by a sperm cell, naturalists have not yet found out.", "It is quite certain that these exceptional creatures have been derived from ancestors which had their eggs fertilised in the regular way, and that this elimination of the male is a special device, an innovation.", "There are incomplete attempts at it in other insects.", "Thus it has been discovered that the queen bee produces only females from the eggs which are fertilised before she lays them.", "When the stock of sperm cells which she received from a drone in her nuptial flight is exhausted, or if we carefully remove by a painless operation the internal sac in which they are stored, the eggs are no longer fertilised, but they are not rendered sterile or abortive.", "They develop into drones!", "And drones or male bees are produced in no other way, and only drones are so produced, never worker females (so called neuters) nor queens.", "Another curious fact is that in rearing moths in captivity some naturalists have quite unexpectedly found that when they have hatched out female moths from the chrysalids and kept them from the moment of hatching quite apart from the male moths (which are of another size and colour, and easily distinguished), these females will sometimes lay eggs—unfertilised eggs—which give birth to caterpillars, which feed and complete all their changes.", "The second generation of moths so produced are male and female, but the females, being kept apart again, produce a parthenogenetic brood, and the process has been repeated to a third generation.", "These instances are very rare.", "The remarkable thing about them is that, apparently, the parthenogenesis is only due to the experimental interference of an entomologist, and that unless some such accident had befallen the moths, the eggs would have been fertilised in the usual way, since there was no deficiency of male moths.", "These facts have led to many interesting speculations, and are particularly curious in regard to the inquiry as to what determines the sex of offspring, about which sensational announcements are sometimes made in the foreign correspondence columns of our newspapers.", "Here we find the parthenogenetic eggs of the moths producing both males and females, those of the aphides and the pond shrimp producing predominantly females, and those of the queen bee producing exclusively males (drones).", "Biologists have not yet arrived at a solution of the problem raised by these divergent results.", "It is necessary, in regard to this subject, to remember that many lower animals and plants can reproduce or propagate by separating buds, or large bits of their bodies, built up of thousands of cells, and, therefore, not to be confused with the single egg cell.", "The egg cell is a cell specially prepared for fusion with a sperm cell, necessitating—except in very rare instances—the union in the new individual or young of living material from two separate parental organisms, and, therefore, in many cases, from two widely separate lines of ancestry.", "A snippet, or bit cut from a begonia leaf, will produce a new individual plant; a bit cut or torn from a polyp will similarly give rise to a new individual  but the parthenogenetic egg is not to be confused with these masses of cells.", "It is a true egg cell which might have been fertilised, and it is found in animals such as insects and crustaceans, which are more highly elaborated in structure than any which, like the polyps and zoophytes, multiply by buds and cuttings.", "XXXVI  THE DEADLY PHYLLOXERA   It was only after long and patient investigation that the various broods of the terrible Phylloxera which, between 1868 and 1888, destroyed half the vineyards of France, became known, their relations to one another determined, and the final cure for the devastation caused by them decided upon and put into practice.", "In all ordinary plant lice or green fly (aphides) at the end of the summer, the last parthenogenetic brood produces a generation of distinct males and females, which differ a good deal in appearance from the virginal broods of the spring and summer.", "Each female, after receiving sperm cells from a male, lays a single egg, which consists of a fertilised egg cell enclosed in an egg shell.", "It is deposited in a safe place in a crack of the bark of a tree, or on the rootlets of some plant, and remains unchanged through the winter.", "In the spring from every such egg hatches a single female aphis, which feeds and increases in size.", "In a very short time (a week or so) this solitary female (Fig.", "58) proceeds to produce, without male intervention, young which grow from true egg cells which are not laid but remain inside her.", "The young are born or pass out of her as small six legged insects.", "They feed and grow up, and in turn produce parthenogenetically and viviparously broods of young like themselves.", "The first female thus hatched from the winter egg is called a foundress, or stock mother, because she starts a whole colony of young which, by virginal propagation of successive broods, may number many millions in a season.", "These are known as virgin mothers (Fig.", "57), and eventually their later generations always produce males and females, so that we distinguish, in the course of a year, four sets of aphides, starting from the egg, namely (1) the foundresses, (2) the numerous generations of virgin mothers, (3) the males, and (4) the egg laying females.", "In different kinds of plant lice any of these sets may be either winged or wingless (Figs.", "55, 56, 59); many generations of the virgin mothers are wingless, but not all, in all species.", "According to the species or kind of aphis and its requirements in regard to the plants on which it feeds, wings are developed so as to enable the aphis to fly from one tree or locality to another, or are not developed if the aphis has to remain where it was born.", "The whole series of successive broods of some kinds of aphis remain on one plant and about the same part of it, and then there is little need for wings.", "Others have their summer broods on the twigs or leaves, but the later broods descend in winter to the roots of the same plant.", "The woolly aphis of the apple trees and pear trees behaves in this way; other species again produce a late winged brood, which leaves the plant on which its parents were feeding, and travels some distance to the twigs or to the roots of a quite distinct kind of plant to produce an autumn brood, and from these the final males and females are born, and the winter eggs are then deposited.", "The hop louse leaves the hop when the hop vine dies down in autumn.", "The abundant wingless form (Fig.", "58) of which there have usually been ten generations, produces at last a winged migrant brood (Fig.", "59) which flies away to plum trees and sloe bushes, perhaps a quarter of a mile distant.", "There the migrants produce wingless females on the plum tree.", "They are followed to the plum trees by a final migrant brood from the dying hops which are males—the first yet seen (Fig.", "56).", "The males fertilise the wingless females born on the plum tree—and the latter lay each one fertilised egg in the crevices of the bark of the plum tree near the young buds.", "Winter now sets in  all are dead except the eggs.", "In the following late spring a foundress hatches out from each egg so deposited.", "The foundress (Fig.", "58) in this species, the hop aphis, is wingless.", "She produces parthenogenetically and viviparously a brood of wingless females.", "They similarly produce on the plum tree a third generation of virgin females, but these have wings!", "(Fig.", "55).", "They fly back to the hop vines, which are now well risen from the ground and offer abundant juice to the wingless virgin brood which escapes from the winged migrants as soon as they have settled on the hop, and feed and grow and produce new wingless broods (Fig.", "57) in rapid succession.", "The phylloxera of the vine is a plant louse or aphis, which exhibits an interesting adaptation of winged and wingless broods to the requirements of the insect’s nutrition and multiplication.", "A foundress hatches from an egg on the bark of the vine where it has passed the winter.", "It proceeds to attack the young leaves and to produce a brood of young.", "The leaves of the vine when thus attacked swell up and produce galls, in which the young phylloxera are enclosed, and there the phylloxeras continue to multiply, producing more galls and thus destroying the leaves.", "Some of the young broods now crawl down the vine to its roots; others stay on the leaves and continue their destructive work there.", "There are several varieties of form and size amongst these broods.", "Those which go to the roots attack the rootlets and produce knobs and swellings on them, leading to their destruction as feeding organs.", "Meanwhile the root phylloxeras multiply exceedingly, and those on the leaves are still feeding and multiplying.", "From one foundress mother as many as twenty five millions are produced in six months.", "At last in the autumn the root parasites produce a winged generation of virgin mothers, which come up from the ground and fly away to other vines, upon which they produce males and females.", "These females each lay a fertilised egg on the bark of the previously healthy vine, and so the infection is spread.", "The root infesting forms continue to multiply, and in warm climates there is no cessation of this process even in winter.", "This parasite—the _Phylloxera vastatrix_—was introduced with some American species of grape vine—brought over as experimental samples from Colorado—about 1864.", "In its native country it does comparatively little harm, for the roots of the American species of vine are, though attacked by it, not seriously injured.", "They have the property of throwing out new rootlets when those already existing are punctured and injured by the phylloxera, and so are not killed by the attack, as is the European grape vine.", "The introduction of this deadly parasite to Europe was a mere chance, due to ignorance and stupid want of supervision of importations on the part of the Government, such as is common in this country, though less so in France and Germany—part of the blind mixing up of the nicely adjusted products of all parts of the earth which civilised man is always bringing about with disastrous and terrifying results.", "In twenty years France lost 400 million pounds in consequence; three million acres of vineyards were destroyed.", "Other countries—Germany, Italy, and the Cape—also suffered.", "All sorts of remedies were suggested and tried, such as the application of poisons to the roots and the sinking of the vineyards under water.", "Gradually the only effective method of dealing with the case has been established.", "The old European vine stocks or standards have been grubbed up in all but the very choicest vineyards, and American vines have been planted in their place.", "On to these have been grafted cuttings of the local French vines, and they have taken kindly to their new conditions.", "The produce of the French vineyards is now greater than it has ever been.", "It had fallen from an annual yield of 1,300,000,000 gallons to 650,000,000—but in 1900 it had risen again to a yield of more than 1,400,000,000 gallons.", "This history is a striking instance of the vast importance to civilised communities of a knowledge and control of even such minute living things as the plant lice, and of the extraordinarily large results which obscure living things may produce.", "It must tend to convince reasonable men of the importance of accurate knowledge as to living things and of the necessity of expending public money in constantly improving and extending that knowledge.", "An ingenious illustration of the enormous fecundity of the plant lice occurs to me as worth giving in conclusion.", "The late Professor Huxley—a careful and trustworthy authority—calculated that the produce of a single aphis would, in the course of ten generations, supposing all the individuals to survive, contain more ponderable substance than five hundred millions of stout men; that is, more than the whole population of China. And this calculation is held by some authorities to be below rather than above the mark!", "XXXVII  CLOTHES MOTHS   The way in which the lives of all animals and plants are interwoven with that of other animals and plants, often in obscure and unsuspected ways, comes home to man when he contemplates the numbers and variety of living things which exist with him and upon him—that is to say, at his expense and to the detriment of the stores which he accumulates, the clothing with which he covers himself, and the buildings which he constructs.", "Man not only has carefully taken a number of animals and plants in hand and cultivated them as food givers, as sources of clothing, and other useful material, but, much to his annoyance, he finds, per contra, that other animals (and plants, too), with similar self seeking habit, make use of him in his turn, and of his belongings, with a complete disregard of his convenience, treating him and his arrangements as so much available food stuff, and showing no atom of respect to him as the lord of creation.", "Just as in dealing with the more deadly attacks of disease producing parasites, so in meeting the destructive invasions made by his fellow creatures of all sizes and kinds in search of food and shelter—man has to be continually on the alert, and to wage a constant warfare, unless he will consent to see himself and his possessions moth eaten, fly blown, worm burrowed, reduced to fragments and powder.", "And this warfare he has incessantly carried on with increasing skill and knowledge from the earliest times of which we have any record.", "The sparrow and the rat, of which there has lately been much talk, are examples of fairly large, easily detected enemies of this kind.", "The almost ultra microscopic bacteria—similar to those which produce disease by multiplying in the living body—are examples of the most minute living pests which injure man by causing sourness, putrefaction, and destructive rot in his food and stores.", "Every year civilised man is gaining greater knowledge of these ferment organisms, and vastly increased skill in preserving his possessions, such as food and drink, from the attacks of their ubiquitous swarms.", "Between the larger depredators, such as birds and rats, and the smallest, such as the microscopic bacteria and moulds (to whom alone putrefaction is due, and without whom it would never occur), there are a host of small troublesome creatures, which belong chiefly to the group of animals called insects—beetles, moths, flies, and bugs—which give man incessant occupation in warding off their attacks upon his food, his clothes, his furniture, his buildings, his crops and fruit trees, and his domesticated animals.", "The study of these things and of the means of grappling with them is the fascinating occupation of those who are called economic zoologists and botanists.", "Of course, in order to carry on their inquiries successfully they have to bring to bear on the questions they investigate as complete and thorough a knowledge as possible of all the kinds of animals and plants, and of their ways of feeding, reproducing, and protecting themselves in natural conditions.", "One of the most widely celebrated and anciently detested of insect pests is the clothes moth.", "It is the caterpillar of this moth which is objectionable—biting off, eating, and using to weave a case the hair of furs and the fine filaments of woollen fabrics.", "Not every one is able to recognise the clothes moth, which is a very small creature of a greyish yellow colour.", "The wings when set for flying measure only half an inch in expanse, and when the moth is walking or at rest, shut closely to the body so as to give it an almost cylindrical shape, with an attenuated snout.", "Much bigger moths occasionally get into our rooms, but do no harm.", "These little clothes moths lay their eggs on fur or wool, and the caterpillars which hatch from them do the damage.", "The moths themselves have no jaws and take no food.", "But the caterpillar or grub, though soft and readily crushed, has a pair of very hard, minute, dark coloured jaws, with which it works away, cropping the fur and wool on which it lives.", "The moths are seen in houses commonly between January and October, and it is, of course, the object of the victimised householder to destroy them before they can lay eggs, or, what is more practical, to keep woollen and fur clothes away from their reach.", "Things which are in daily use are not very liable to receive a deposit of eggs from the clothes moth, and as a rule the enemy may be kept at bay by daily shaking and beating the things in question, and hanging them up in the air.", "But coats, flannels, etc., which are hidden away, left quietly in drawers or cupboards, offer the undisturbed conditions which the clothes moth seeks.", "There is no safety for them unless they are wrapped up or shut in with a quantity of naphtol or of camphor, or, as is nowadays more usual, placed in a refrigerating chamber.", "The little caterpillar which does all the damage is of a dull white colour, with a reddish head.", "It is remarkable for the fact that it makes a sort of movable tunic or case for itself out of the hair or wool which it crops, and it crawls about protected by this case.", "There are not many insects which thus construct portable cases for themselves when in the grub or caterpillar state of life.", "Such cases must not be confused with the very similar cocoons by which some moth grubs surround themselves (as, for instance, the silkworm moth) when their growth is completed, and they become quiescent and hard, and are known as chrysalids.", "Such cocoons are constructed in the same way as the lining of the clothes moth’s case, by threads of silk secreted by the caterpillar, but they are made once for all when the grub has ceased activity.", "The little clothes moth caterpillar, on the other hand, has continually to enlarge its tunic or case as it itself increases in size.", "There is a hole at the end, from which the head and three legs of the caterpillar emerge, so that it can crawl and feed freely.", "The outer surface of the case consists of cut lengths of the fibre on which the grub is living, and so is protective in resembling the surrounding material and hiding the minute ravager.", "It is easy enough for the little grub to add a bit to the case at the end from which its head protrudes, and, being very flexible, it can turn right round in the tube and put its head out at the other end and secrete a bit more there, cementing cut hairs to the outer surface.", "But in order to increase the breadth of the tube or case, the caterpillar has, from time to time, to undertake a formidable operation.", "It actually slits up the case lengthwise for about half its extent, and fills in the gaping space with new material; then it cuts up the opposite face of the same half of the tube, and puts in a new patch there.", "And after that, it has to treat the remaining half of the tube in the same way, making two more cuts, one opposite the other, and filling in the gap in each case as before.", "Students of these little creatures have amused themselves by changing the position of the caterpillar and its case, from fur or wool of one colour to fur or wool of another colour, and in this way the industrious caterpillar is made to work in different coloured fibre in successive enlargements of his case, so that it becomes a Joseph’s coat of many colours.", "An interesting fact about the movable case made by the clothes moth caterpillar is that the nearest thing in nature to it is the case made by the aquatic grubs or caterpillars of another kind of insects—the caddis worms (case worms) which are common in ponds and streams.", "They show extraordinary powers in making their cases so that they balance nicely in the water, as the animal crawls along on the bottom of a pool, with his head and six legs emerging from one end of the case.", "Caddis worms are of various kinds or species, and some attach to their cases little broken sticks, others minute empty snail shells, others the fine green threads of water plants.", "The caddis worm becomes changed into a delicate fly, with transparent wings, just as the clothes grub becomes changed into a moth—and it is an interesting fact that the caddis flies, though they are classed with the May flies and such net winged insects, and not with the moths and butterflies (the _Lepidoptera_, or insects with wings covered with dust like scales, which give the colour and patterns to the wings), yet agree with moths in having some scales on the wings and with one kind of minute moth, namely, the clothes moth, in having grubs which make movable cases.", "The clothes moth caterpillar was known to the Romans by the name _Tinea_, and is described with correct detail by the Roman naturalist Pliny.", "Modern naturalists have accepted this name _Tinea_ as that of the genus to which the clothes moth belongs.", "There are thirty different British species of _Tinea_, of which four are guilty of attacking animal fabric, and so causing trouble to man.", "The one which builds a case and is the titular chief of the clan of clothes moths—the clothes moth, just as one may say the Macintosh—is scientifically indicated by the name _Tinea pellionella_.", "The other three do not form movable cases when in the caterpillar stage, and attack coarser stuff than fur and fine wool.", "One of them is known as the tapestry moth, because its caterpillar establishes itself in old tapestry and carpets, and burrowing into these thickish materials is concealed without the aid of any self provided tunic or case.", "The name _Tinea_ is often used by entomologists in an expanded form as _Tineina_, to indicate the whole series of minute moths of which the genus _Tinea_ is only one little group.", "Many of these moths are much smaller even than the clothes moth, and they are found in all parts of the world and in all sorts and conditions of life—in relation to trees, shrubs, and plants of all kinds.", "It has been estimated that there are as many as 200,000 distinctly marked different kinds of these minute creatures.", "The insect collectors and students who occupy themselves with the magnificent butterflies and larger moths (of which there are an enormous variety of kinds) refuse to deal with the somewhat dull looking and almost innumerable minute moths which are classed as _Micro lepidoptera_, in contrast to the _Macro lepidoptera_ (or big moths and butterflies).", "Consequently they have become the favourite study of a few enthusiasts, who are known as Micro lepidopterists, and have a wide but not uninteresting field of exploration all to themselves.", "The _Micro lepidoptera_ include, besides the _Tineina_, a group of less minute though small moths, with narrow, fringed wings, amongst which are the window moth, the milk moth, the tabby moth, the meal moth, and the grease moth.", "Though the clothes moths may well be described as tiny moths, yet the word _Tinea_, as applied to them, has no such origin, but is the name given to the destructive grub by the Romans.", "The same word has unfortunately been applied by medical men and botanists to a vegetable parasite which causes a skin disease (ringworm) resulting in baldness.", "The _Tinea calvans_ of the doctors has only this in common with the moth _Tinea pellionella_—that it causes hair to disappear and baldness to ensue; but the vegetable parasite attacks the hair on a living man’s head, the caterpillar that on his fur coat.", "XXXVIII  STONE AND WOOD BORERS   Boring into wood is a favourite proceeding on the part of many small creatures, insects, shrimps, and ship worms, by which they not only acquire nourishment, but at the same time penetrate more and more deeply into safe quarters and concealment.", "It is not surprising that it has become the necessary and regular mode of life of a host of small animals, and consequently that man who wants wood in good sound blocks and planks for his various constructions is a good deal put out by the voracity of the wood boring community.", "To some extent he has given up the task of checking their proceedings, and now uses metal where he formerly used wood, but that only applies to a limited field.", "Wood is still the great material of rough construction, and the main substance used in fittings and furniture.", "In our own country and in most parts of the world there are large grubs or caterpillars, such as those of the goat moth, three inches long and as thick as one’s finger, which eat into the stems of trees and spoil the timber.", "The grub of the handsome moth known as the wood leopard is another of these.", "It attacks poplar trees, and we used to take it in numbers in the London parks and squares when I was a collector.", "The goat moth is specially destructive to willow trees.", "But there are a very large series of smaller grubs and adult insects which injure trees or bore or devour wood already cut and dried.", "Among these are the saw flies and a number of beetles, and in Sicily and the tropics there are the wonderful white ants which are not ants at all, but more like May flies.", "The destruction caused by these borers and eaters of wood is increased by the fact that when they have riddled a piece of wood, moisture penetrates it, and vegetable moulds flourish within it and complete the break up.", "Among the most destructive borers of wood are those which attack the ships and piers of wood placed by man in the sea.", "These are certain shell fish, called ship worms (_Teredo_), which are really peculiarly modified mussels.", "There is also a tiny shrimp like creature, the _Limnoria terebrans_, which does enormous damage by its borings to piers of wood erected in the sea.", "True insects do not flourish in the sea.", "There are marine bivalve shell fish which bore into clay, sandstone, chalk, and even into hard granite like rock.", "They do not use jaws or teeth for this purpose, but the surface of their shells, which are sharp and spiny, and also the sand which adheres to their soft muscular bodies like emery powder to the pewter plate of a lapidary’s wheel.", "You may see the large and small holes made by _Pholas_ (called also the piddock) and other bivalve shell fish in the clay and chalk rocks of the seashore on most parts of the English coast.", "Most boring animals swallow the material which they excavate in the act of boring, just as the earth worm swallows the soil into which it bores, and as many sand worms do, throwing out from the hind end of the body, in the form of a little coiled up heap, a vast quantity of undigested matter which has passed through them.", "But many insects which swallow some of the material disengaged by their jaws remove, in addition, a large quantity which is ejected from the boring as powder, like sawdust, and others do not swallow any of the material into which they bore.", "So, too, the _Pholas_ and marine boring mussels do not swallow the material which they loosen.", "It is a very slow process, the boring in rock, and the fine particles rubbed away by incessant movement are carried off in the sea water.", "To some extent the marine creatures which bore in rocks seem to be helped by chemical action, since they show a preference for chalk and limestone, easily dissolved by weak acid secreted by the borer, though, clearly enough, they are not dependent on such chemical aid since we find them also boring in insoluble granite rock and shale and clay.", "There is one true worm borer which perforates hard limestone pebbles and chalk rocks, so as to give them the appearance which we call worm eaten when caused by another sort of worm and observed in a very different material, namely, old furniture and woodwork.", "At Tenby, in South Wales, the limestone pebbles on the beach are quite commonly riddled with these worm holes, truly worm eaten. When they are not too abundant one can see that the holes are arranged in pairs like a figure 8, about half the size here printed.", "On splitting the rock or stone one finds a deeply running U shaped double tube excavated in the stone.", "In this the little worm lived.", "It is easiest to get at the worms in a fresh and living state on a coast where there are chalk rocks and sea washed lumps of chalk.", "The chalk is easy to split and cut at low tide, and then the little key hole apertures can be broken across and the soft red worm extracted.", "It is a beautiful red blooded little worm—little more than half an inch long—with two tactile horns on its head and little bristles and gills on the rings of its annulated body.", "It is a true worm, like the earth worm, what naturalists call by the not displeasing name an annelid.

But the most notable of the insect enemies of books and papers is a curious little wingless insect which never passes through a grub stage of existence, but hatches out in the complete form of his parents.", "He is about a third of an inch long, has the shape of an elongated kite, with a long tail and six legs, and is called by old writers the silver fish, and by entomologists _Lepisma_ (Fig.", "63).", "This little pest does not burrow, but nibbles, and has destroyed many a valuable old document and ancient book.", "Paste and sugar are a great attraction to him, and he will destroy a boxful of printed labels or a valuable manuscript, leaving only the ink marked parts untouched, but ready to crumble.", "Closely allied to the book worm beetle, _Anobium_, is a larger beetle, called _Xestobium tessellatum_ (Fig.", "62 _a_) which infests old woodwork, its grubs making correspondingly larger tunnels.", "The entire woodwork of a house has had to be removed and replaced in consequence of this creature’s depredation, and such pieces of furniture as a four post bedstead have been riddled and made rotten in two or three years by its burrowing.", "It is still common in England in old wood panelled rooms and in wooden mantelpieces.", "The most interesting fact about it is that it is the maker of those nocturnal tappings which are known as the death watch. It is the beetle itself (Fig.", "62 _a_), not the grub, which makes these sounds.", "It makes them by deliberately striking the wood on which it stands, with its head.", "The taps are usually from five to seven in quick succession, the sound dying away in intensity in the later strokes.", "A second, and even a third, beetle will then reply with similar taps from the woodwork of some other part of the room.", "Years ago I used to be gently lulled to sleep by these raps in my rooms at Oxford, accompanied by the sound of spasmodic rushes of mice behind the woodwork.", "At first I thought the tapping was caused by the falling of drops of water through a leaky roof, but soon ascertained the actual cause.", "One does not notice these tappings until the dead of night when all else is still, and they are so mysterious and persistent that one can understand superstition arising in connection with them, and that the nerves of any one already overwrought, might be so affected by them as to lead to the belief that evil spirits are rapping, or that a ghostly coffin is being nailed together for a dying man.", "The little beetle has often been tracked by a naturalist, and discovered in some concealed position nodding its diminutive but hard head with sharp jerks, and producing an almost incredible volume of sound in proportion to its size.", "If the beetle, when discovered, is kept in captivity in a wooden box, it is easy to set it tapping or rapping by tapping oneself with a pencil on the table on which the box is placed, when the faithful little death watch will unfailingly reply.", "Possibly some of the raps recorded by the pioneers of spirit rapping, when not produced by the toes of designing mediums like the young ladies of Rochester, N.Y., were actually made by death watch beetles.", "It is certain that the somewhat eccentric supposition that disembodied spirits endeavour to make signals to living humanity by rapping owes its origin (long before the nineteenth century craze for spirit rapping) to the measured tap tap tapping of the death watch beetle, and the consequent superstition at a time when the beetle was not known to be the tapper.  Whilst the bigger beetle, _Xestobium_, is the common death watch, it has been proved that the little furniture beetle, _Anobium_, is also a tapper, making regular and persistent strokes like the ticking of a watch.", "Another insect, called the book louse (_Atropos divinatoria_), very minute, only one twentieth of an inch, soft, white, and wingless, not a beetle at all, but also a devourer of literature (Fig.", "64), is declared by some good observers to be a ticker or tapper, but other naturalists deny that it can make such sounds.", "It seems unlikely on account of the extremely small size and softness of the book louse, but the matter needs further investigation.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "63.—The silver fish insect (_Lepisma saccharina_).", "The line to the right shows its natural size.]", "A curious fact is that the grubs of beetles such as _Anobium_ and _Xestobium_ (or other closely allied kinds) are not arrested in their tunnelling by soft metal.", "They cannot tackle iron plate or brass sheeting, but they will penetrate tinfoil and, what is more astonishing, lead plate and leaden waterpipes.", "Specimens showing such perforations are in the museums of Oxford and London, and I have received an account of a lead pipe packed in wood in the wall of a house being perforated by these beetle grubs.", "Once at work on the wood, the straightforward intentions of the grub are not to be diverted by such an obstacle as lead  it goes straight on through the lead as it would through the cover of a book or a knot in the wood.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "64.—The book louse, or _Atropos divinatoria_, a soft, cream coloured, wingless insect smaller than a flea.", "It is believed by some observers to be capable of making sounds like the ticking of a watch.]", "I have sometimes been asked to give advice as to the best method of destroying the furniture worm or grub.", "If the piece of furniture (or its pieces) can without injury be baked in a hot chamber for twenty four hours, at a temperature a little above that of boiling water, that is the easiest method of destroying the pest.", "Or, again, I should suggest placing the piece of furniture in a refrigerating chamber for a week or two.", "If neither of these methods can be used, the piece of furniture should be placed in a very hot room, and creosote or bisulphide of carbon or solution of cyanide of potassium should be injected with a very fine nosed syringe into the little circular holes of the burrows on the surface of the wood; then the piece of furniture must be at once exposed to the cold, which will cause the air to be drawn into the burrows and diffuse the volatile poison within.", "The worm holes on the surface should, as soon as the piece of furniture is quite cold, be closed by melted paraffin.", "If the piece of wood which it is desired to cure will stand submersion in water for a few minutes, and is not larger than a cricket bat, it is, of course, easy, by first warming it through and then plunging it into water containing corrosive sublimate or other poison, fairly to impregnate the burrows, and make an end of the beetles and their grubs.", "Painting is the common and approved means of protecting wood against these attacks, and in some positions metal sheathing is used.", "The method most largely used for protecting wood in the open air against worm and mould is that of forcing creosote into its pores—an improvement on the old system of painting with coal tar.", "A more expensive but beautiful method of protecting wood is to force hard paraffin in a melted condition by pressure into the pores.", "The wood becomes wonderfully firm and waterproof.", "Neither damp and mould, nor boring insect, nor shrimp can then penetrate it.", "This method was introduced some years ago, but I do not know whether it has been largely used.", "XXXIX  CHRISTMAS FARE   Most English people who can afford it eat more than is good for them on Christmas Day, and consider it more or less of a religious duty to do so, even though they shrink from the ordeal.", "It is an interesting tendency, and at the same time one readily explained.", "Primitive men, and our own remote ancestors, had few, if any, joys greater than those afforded by an abundant meal of roasted meat.", "When a great beast such as a mammoth was taken in a skilfully prepared pitfall, and slaughtered, the whole tribe of palaeolithic huntsmen assembled and gorged themselves with its flesh, which, it seems fairly certain, they cooked on open fires.", "The strongest seized the most and ate the most, and were able to bear up the longest in something like full vigour until such time as another big beast should be killed, and another opportunity for gorging should arise, when they would naturally again get the largest share, having eaten most on the previous occasion, and so being least famished.", "Hence the belief that a great appetite is a fine thing, and that the more you can eat, the stronger and better you are, is one of the deeply laid traditions of humanity which civilised men have inherited from barbarians, and are only slowly commencing to criticise and to put aside.", "The negroes who accompany European sportsmen in Central Africa gorge themselves when elephants are killed, and a recent account tells of the serious illness and danger to an expedition caused by the whole countryside flocking to the carcasses of twenty three elephants killed by an ivory hunter.", "The blacks continued to eat the flesh of the elephants for three weeks, when it had become decidedly high, and many died, whilst others took weeks to recover, in consequence.", "The notion of festivity, which, especially in England, has been, even in recent times, that of eating and drinking to excess, is prehistoric and barbaric.", "Serious physiologists and medical men have expressed the opinion that we shall never arrive at a satisfactory mode of nourishing ourselves so as to take neither too much nor what is in itself injurious to health, until the practice of seeking gaiety and celebrating a memory or honouring a friend or friends by means of profuse eating (often followed by wearisome speeches) has given place to a mode of rejoicing which is more likely to produce hilarity and lightness of heart, and less certain to be followed by painful and injurious results.", "We certainly eat less and drink less of intoxicating liquors than we did, but there is, it seems, still room for improvement.", "To connect heavy feeding with Christmas, the third in rank of the great festivals of the Church, is not a universal custom, and is, in fact, a peculiarity of our own country, arising from the rearing and management of cattle in early times, when English pasture land furnished a splendid means of enriching its owners by the production of hides and leather.", "Large numbers of cattle had to be stalled during winter and fed on stored herbage, and a great many were at this season killed and the meat salted down, since it would not pay to keep them on stored food.", "It was not until the introduction of root crops that oxen could be kept in any number through the winter months.", "Hence there was an excess of fresh meat and fat about Christmas time, and the roast beef, plum puddings, and mincemeat of Christmas fare were abundant.", "The true Christmas pudding and mince pie had meat as part of their components, and, of course, beef suet enters largely into their composition at the present day.", "The practice of eating sweet fruits and preserves with meat (as in the true mince pie) still lingers in this country, but has become less general than it is in Germany.", "We still eat red currant jelly with roast mutton, and also with hare, and apple sauce is considered appropriate to roast pork and to goose; but pickled plums and cherries and sugared crab apples, which are usually taken with meat in Germany, are not known to us.", "I have heard a schoolboy express indignation at being given plums with roast meat.", "Mincemeat, for mince pies, was originally (like a Cornish pasty, in which raisins are mixed with meat) one of these combinations of sweetness and strength—of sugar and meat—the taste for which has unaccountably disappeared in these days of mechanical uniformity and lack of homely cheer.  The introduction of the turkey as a Christmas dish dates from the early time of the importation of that bird into Europe, namely, about 1550.", "It is already spoken of in connection with Christmas fare in 1570.", "The turkey cock, as its full name was, is an American bird, and was brought originally from Mexico to Europe, though it is possible that the more northern American species may have been also introduced by the navigator, Jean Cabot.", "There is a very gorgeous turkey cock of iridescent bright blue and green, with orange red warts on his head and neck, found in Honduras.", "But he has never been acclimatised.", "He is on view in the Natural History Museum.", "The turkey belongs to the pheasant family, and is compared by old writers to the peacock, and also to the guinea fowl (_Numida meleagris_ of ornithologists).", "Indeed, there was great confusion when the turkey first arrived between it and the guinea fowl, and it appears to be owing to this mixing up of the two birds that the American bird was called a turkey cock, since the guinea fowl is an African bird, and came into the hands of Europeans through Mussulman traders or Turks. So far did the confusion go that the great Linnæus applied the Latin name _Meleagris_, which was that of the guinea fowl, to the turkey of America!", "Some people think that the turkey cock established his misleading name by his cry, which they say is represented by the words Turk turk turk. Probably the turkey cock, though an American bird, was imported by traders who were called Turkey merchants because their chief business was with the Levantine and Morocco ports.", "Another mistake or vagueness as to the native home of the turkey was hit upon by the French, who called it the _Poule d’Inde_, whence their modern name for it, _Dindon_; and the same error is found in an old German name for it, _Kalkuttisch Hün_ (from Calicut, on the Malabar coast of India, where the turkey was introduced from America in the seventeenth century, and has flourished ever since).", "The Swedish name for the turkey is _Kalcon_, and is only a modification of this old German name.", "Probably few animals or birds have been so persistently misrepresented by the names given to them as the American bird which we call the turkey.", "Our farmyard names for him are far better.", "In Scotland they call him the Bubbly jock, which vividly suggests his airs and graces, whilst in Suffolk we call him a Gobble cock. I know an old farmhouse near Woodbridge, in Suffolk, which bears the delightful name of Gobblecock Hall. The squire of Gobblecock Hall would have furnished Randolph Caldecott with inspiration for a Christmas picture story; and so, indeed, would the country round the Hall, with its vast sandy tract, ten miles long, known as Hollesley Heath, ending on the seashore near Orford Castle.", "The misleading indication as to the native land of an animal—due to the name commonly applied to it—is remarkable in the case of the guinea pig.", "Though the guinea fowl is correctly so called, since it comes from the Guinea Coast of Africa, the guinea pig has nothing to do with that coast, but comes from South America!", "It is not a pig, but a rodent, and it does not come from Guinea.", "It appears that the ships of the Guinea merchants of this country established trading relations with South American ports, and hence the little pig (Shakespeare calls the hedgehog hedge pig) which they brought home was called a guinea pig, just as the big cock imported by Turkey merchants was called a Turkey cock. The guinea pig suffers other indignities of appellation. The Germans call him _Meerschweinchen_, that is, little sea pig. Apparently sea pig, because he was brought over the sea.", "But this leads to unjustifiable suggestions as to the guinea pig’s character.", "For the Germans call the porpoise _Meerschwein_, which would seem to mean pig of the sea; and those imperfectly acquainted with the German language have been known to take allusions made by German writers to the former animal as intended to apply to the young of the latter.", "Thus one reads in an English medical book of a number of young porpoises being fed upon carrots when it was really guinea pigs which consumed this nutriment.", "The German physiologists, who often make use of guinea pigs in their investigations, now call them _Cobayas_, so as to avoid any further misunderstanding.", "The French word for a porpoise, _marsouin_, is a corruption of the German name _Meerschwein_.", "I have pointed out above the origin of heavy feeding at Christmas.", "Whether it is necessary or not to continue that precise mode of celebration, the sentiments of peace and goodwill which belong to Christmas, the meeting of kinsmen,—and, above all, the dedication of many of its customs to children,—are things to be cherished and treated tenderly.", "The 25th day of December was fixed by the Church for the celebration of the birth of Christ, but it is fairly certain that the period of the year indicated in the Gospel as that when the shepherds were watching their flocks and saw the star of Bethlehem, was not December, but October.", "It is also certain that the children owe their share in Christmas to the combination with it of customs proper to the Epiphany, which celebrates the bringing of gifts to the child Christ by the wise men of the East.", "It appears that the greatest and gayest of the feasts of pagan Rome—the Saturnalia—was held at the end of December, and that the early Church in this, as in many other cases, adapted a pagan custom to its own uses, and fixed the feast of the Nativity at this date expressly in order to take over, as it were, the gaiety of the Saturnalia.", "The brilliant foliage and berries of the holly tree were used for decorations at the Saturnalia, and thus became a Christmas emblem.", "The fun and frolic of the Saturnalia were transferred to the name of Christmas, and thus it comes about that the Yule Log and the Lord of Misrule and the Abbot of Unreason, and also snapdragon and clown, harlequin and columbine, are found in full swing at Christmas tide.", "Later St.", "Nicholas, who took the place of Neptune, and was the patron saint of sailors, became associated with Christmas celebrations as Santa Claus or Father Christmas.", "His regular day was at the beginning of December, and so it was easy to postpone his festivities to three weeks later.", "Mistletoe is not a Christmas decoration.", "It comes to us from the Druids, and belongs to the New Year.", "It is not allowed to appear in church, and should not be hung up in private houses till Christmas is over and the New Year has come.", "The hanging up of the mistletoe is in itself a beautiful survival of an ancient worship, and should be associated in our minds with Stonehenge and the prehistoric star temples, whose priests were astronomers.", "On New Year’s Day they solemnly distributed branches of the mistletoe to the people as a charm ensuring fertility.", "In December there are many hundredweight of mistletoe cut down and despatched from the ancient Druidical haunts of the Welsh border, and from over sea Brittany, to all devouring London, where it is heedlessly nailed up in doorways, and made the excuse for much giggling and embracing.", "May those who read these lines treat it with due reverence, and when they kiss beneath the beautiful strange branch with its white berries, think of our ancestors—the noble youths and lovely maidens of prehistoric days, who kissed three thousand years ago, and sent this living token of their happy lives down the long ages—to us, distracted hustlers of the motor car.", "Prehistoric feeding may not be good for us, but the prehistoric rite of the mistletoe must not be neglected in these days of strange political aspirations on the part of those who have not discovered its sedative virtue.", "XL  THE ORIGIN OF OPIUM   That Europe is the original home of the opium poppy, and not Asia, is even more contradictory of our settled traditions and belief than the fact that Europeans gave tobacco to the East.", "Yet it is the fact that opium, like tobacco, came to the Far East from Europe.", "The opium poppy does not grow wild in Asia; it is a cultivated variety of a Mediterranean poppy, the _Papaver setigerum_, which has a pale purple flower, and was conveyed, long ago, by man from the Levant to Asia.", "We have true poppies of four species which grow wild in England, all with splendid scarlet or crimson petals, easily distinguished from one another by the shape of the seedboxes, or capsules, which they form.", "If you scratch the surface of the seed capsule of one of these poppies a milky juice appears.", "It is this which is collected from the capsules of the much larger opium poppy in India and China, and when dried forms a hard brown cake, which is called opium. It consists of resinous matter, in which is contained a small quantity of the invaluable narcotic called morphia, and also small quantities of other powerful poisons.", "The pale purple poppy of the Mediterranean (_Papaver setigerum_) was cultivated hundreds—even thousands—of years ago in the South of Europe and on the Mediterranean shores of Africa—not for opium, but for the oil which can be expressed from the seed, poppy seed oil. The oil is free from narcotic properties.", "The purple poppy is still cultivated for that oil in France, and poppy seed oil is an article of commerce used as food, both in the pure state and for adulterating other oils.", "The earliest cultivation of this poppy is even as remote in Europe as 7000 years, for we find that the Swiss lake dwellers of the Stone Age cultivated it, and that the variety they obtained was nearer to the wild _Papaver setigerum_ than to its cultivated derivative, the modern opium poppy, _Papaver somniferum_.", "How and when it first was recognised that the narcotic substance opium could be prepared from the juice exuding from the cut capsule is not exactly known, but it is probable that it was not until the early Middle Ages that the poppy was cultivated for the habitual use of opium as a narcotic indulgence, and that its earlier cultivation was, as to some extent at the present day, for the sake of the oil contained in the seed, its use in medicine requiring but a very small supply.", "The ancient Greeks were well acquainted with the cultivated poppy.", "Homer mentions it, and at a much later period Theophrastus and Dioscorides do so.", "They call it mekon, and were aware of the somniferous properties of the sap.", "Dioscorides, whose wonderful book on plants dates from the first century of our era, speaks of the drug derived from the sap by the name opos, and it is from that word that the name opium has come.", "The Romans cultivated the poppy before the republic, and mixed its seeds with their flour in making bread.", "The story of King Tarquin taking the governor of a rebellious province into a poppy field, lopping off the heads of the taller poppies with his stick, and then turning to his visitor, without a word, but with a look which said, That is the way to govern—is evidence of the very early cultivation of the poppy by the Romans.", "Hebrew writings do not mention the opium poppy, though it seems to be certain that it has been cultivated in Asia Minor for at least 3000 years.", "There is no evidence that the plant was cultivated in more ancient times in Egypt, although in Pliny’s time the Egyptians used the juice of the poppy medicinally.", "In the Middle Ages it was, and in our own day it is, one of the chief objects of cultivation in that country, especially for the manufacture of opium.", "The cultivated variety _P.", "somniferum_ of the present day differs from the wild _P.", "setigerum_, in having the seed capsule surmounted by ten or twelve stigmas (the free ends of the leaves which are united to form the capsule), instead of by eight as in the wild form.", "It seems that the introduction of the poppy from the shores of the Mediterranean into Persia, India, and China is due to Arab traders, and is coincident with the rise of Mohammedanism; and it is probable that it was valued and cultivated from that time onwards, not so much for the sake of its seed and oil, as for the narcotic juice, which was made up by Arabian confectioners into a kind of paste, and eaten, as were other vegetable extracts—such as bang, from hemp—for the sake of the pleasurable effects produced by its poisonous action on the nervous system.", "It is certain that the opium poppy does not occur at all in the wild state in the Middle and Far East.", "In 1516 opium was already an article of trade from India to China.", "The poppy was cultivated, and the use of opium known and frequent in India for some five centuries before that date.", "Probably the cultivation of the plant in China was not started until the eighteenth century.", "It was the Chinese who hit upon the mode of indulging in opium by smoking it in a pipe.", "There is no record, written or pictorial, of this practice earlier than 1730, about fifty years before which date (1680) we find the smoking of tobacco represented on Chinese pottery.", "Very soon the Chinese were not content to import their opium from India, but large areas were put under cultivation with the Indian poppy in China and Manchuria.", "For a century or more the export of opium from India to China continued and increased as the consumption of the drug increased, the native Chinese production not being sufficient to meet the demand.", "In 1730 and 1796 the Chinese Government issued edicts forbidding the smoking of opium, and in the last century the efforts of the Chinese authorities to prevent the importation of Indian opium, whether with a view to suppress a dangerous vice or to favour the home grown article, led to war with England.", "In some parts of China—for instance, Amoy—three fourths of the population are, or were until lately, opium smokers.", "Now it is believed that the Chinese Government is genuinely determined to put a stop to the dangerous and enervating indulgence in this narcotic, and the opium growers of India will have to limit their output, and employ their land and labour for other crops.", "It is the fact that the eating of opium (for it is not smoked there) does very little harm in India, since it is not used by a large proportion of the people nor in excess.", "Many persons who have studied the subject maintain that the widely spread injury caused by opium in China is due to the short time during which it has been in use there as compared with India.", "It is held that a population after a few centuries becomes immune to such poisonous but attractive indulgences by the killing out of those who cannot resist excess—and the suggestion is that the simplest way of dealing with such cravings for poison is to let those who have them and cannot resist their demand, freely indulge and die, and their stock with them.", "This is, however, a slow and tedious way of eradicating an evil tendency.", "It may, perhaps, be the only way, and hereafter, when the production by careful and restricted breeding of a sound and healthy population becomes recognised as being part of the duty of the makers and administrators of the law in civilised states, it is not improbable that we shall see something of the kind deliberately put into practice.", "The opium pipe and the mode of smoking at present in use in China are very different from the pipe and smoking of tobacco used there or elsewhere.", "I investigated the matter myself twenty years ago in an opium den near the London Docks, under the instruction of a polite Chinaman.", "The opium pipe has a very narrow cavity, about one sixth of an inch wide.", "The prepared opium, in a condition resembling treacle, is smeared on the walls of the cavity with a pin, and the pipe is held to a lighted lamp.", "The flame drawn into the pipe causes the opium to frizzle and give off smoke, but it does not light and continue to burn.", "Each whiff which the smoker inhales has to be procured by applying the pipe to the lamp.", "The smoke is tasteless, and it requires a good deal of patience and several re smearings of the inside of the pipe before the smoker begins to experience the pleasant effects of the drug.", "These consist in the production of a sense of perfect contentment and indifference to all trouble and care, whilst the imagination gives a rose colour, or an even more alluring aspect, to all that one sees or thinks of—until a gentle sleep closes the scene.", "The Chinese, having obtained the seeds, cultivated the opium poppy, and made opium before the prepared article was imported in any great quantity from India.", "There is, of course, no doubt as to the injury which is done to a population by the habitual use of opium.", "At the same time, there is no one who knows anything about medicine and the use of drugs who does not speak of opium with reverence and even affection.", "Forty years ago, at a dinner party where the leading physicians of London were present, it was suggested that they should each write down in order of merit the ten drugs to which they attached the greatest value.", "I heard from one who was present that they all put opium in the first place, and that mercury, iodide of potassium, and ipecacuanha followed in that order in the majority of the lists.", "The value of opium as a medicinal agent is one thing; its deadly effect on those who have become victims to its daily use is another.", "The origin of the medicinal use of opium can be traced to Egypt in Pliny’s time, but beyond that nothing is known.", "As I am writing of botanical matters, I may briefly refer to an ambiguity about the names banana and plantain. There is no difference (as is sometimes suggested) between the fruits indicated by these two words.", "Our word plantain is merely a corruption of the Spanish word _platano_, which is the name of the plane tree.", "It was loosely applied in South America by the Spanish colonists to the banana palm (_Musa sapientum_), just as they called the North American bison a buffalo, and as the Anglo Americans call a stag an elk, and a red thrush a robin.", "The banana palm is not an American tree, but was introduced there from the East Indies by the early navigators, and was very soon cultivated by the South American Indians as well as by the colonists.", "There have been great authorities—for instance, Humboldt—who have believed that there is a native South American banana palm as well as an East Indian one; but the definite conclusion of botanists, after careful inquiry, is that there is only one species, and that it is of South Asian origin.", "There are an enormous number of cultivated varieties—forty four are described; they can all be arranged in two groups, the large fruited bananas (fruit 7 inches to 15 inches long), and the small fruited bananas, commonly called fig bananas (fruits 1 inch to 6 inches long).", "All are equally entitled to the name plantain as well as banana.

apply to his own purposes—so as to make holes with it, saw with it, scrape with it, cut with it, kill with it.", "On account of its prodigious range in time it is found necessary to divide the Stone Age into two periods—a later, called the Neolithic (the new stone period), and an older, stretching back until the traces of it are lost in geologic changes of the earth, which is called the Palæolithic (the old stone period).", "Thus if we start on a time journey to explore the earliest traces of man in Europe, we pass along the centuries back, through the Iron and the Bronze Ages of humanity, and arrive at the vast Stone Age, which stretches away into the obscurity of more than a hundred thousand, probably of many hundred thousand, years.", "The later or newer fringe of the Stone

but he held that it is not to be considered as a missing link, nor as taking us appreciably nearer from modern man to the apes, since it is most closely approached by the flat skulls, already well known, of some of the South Australian natives, both in shape and in the cubical capacity of the brain cavity.", "What I mean by the flatness of the skull may be understood by looking at a side view of a monkey’s skull (Fig.", "81) and of an ordinary European human skull (take the Cromagnon skull as equivalent, Fig.", "75) placed upright, so that the eyes are looking forward.", "If in an outline or photograph of each of these skulls you draw a straight line from a point between the eyebrows back to a point just below the most projecting ridge of the hindermost region of the skull, you will find that above that line in the monkey’s skull is a slightly curved surface—the roof of the brain case.", "But in the human skull above the similarly drawn line the roof bulges so as to form an almost hemispherical dome, rising sometimes vertically in the front region to form the straight, high forehead (which Shakespeare commended, even in woman).", "It swells out in the hinder region also.", "Now the Neander skulls, and to a less extent the skulls of many of the Australian aborigines, are more like the monkey’s in this matter; the dome of the roof is shallow and flat, and the forehead does not rise up, but slopes backwards, so that the whole contents of the brain case are lessened by the reduction of the frontal and upper region.", "And there is reason to consider this frontal region of the brain as specially connected with some of the higher intellectual qualities of the mind.", "We know a little more about the skull of the Neander race since Huxley wrote, owing to the further discovery of specimens.", "The Australian’s skull has usually a more projecting upper jaw and upper front teeth than has the Neander Man’s.", "The Neander skulls stand alone in the great breadth of the orbits and of the nasal region as compared with all known skulls.", "They are also alone (the Gibraltar skull and the new French specimen are the only ones which show it) in the contour of the upper jaw.", "In other human skulls there is a broad depression of the surface—a nipping in, as it were—behind the root of the canine tooth on each side.", "This is absent in the Neander race; the bone here is flat, and not in pushed.", "This absence of modelling, absence of the canine fossa or valley (as it is called), is seen in the larger apes as well as in the Neander Men.", "This point does not show in our figures.", "Some writers think it probable that the Neander Men of the late Glacial Age were the ancestors of the Cromagnards of the Reindeer Age, and also that the artistic Cromagnards were transformed, after many thousand years, into the comparatively dull and inartistic people of the Neolithic period.", "It seems to me, on the contrary, more probable (as is held by some of the French prehistorians) that the Reindeer Men died out, and were replaced by the Neolithic herdsmen who migrated into Western Europe as the climate became milder.", "The notion that the Esquimaux of to day are the Reindeer Men of France who have migrated northwards with their reindeer, following the receding ice, has been entertained, but is regarded by the most careful inquirers as untenable.", "As to the earlier change of race, I hold that it is not possible to contend that the Neander Men developed into the Cromagnards of the Reindeer Age actually in the south of France.", "If the lower race or species gave rise to the higher, the enormous transformation did not occur here nor in Europe at all, nor during the later Pleistocene period.", "Human skulls of the Reindeer Age are known which present an approach to the characters of the Neander race, such as the heavy bony eyebrows.", "But it seems that this is accounted for by the survival of some Neander families alongside of the powerful Cromagnard men and the interbreeding of the two.", "The Cromagnards had probably lived with their reindeer in some more southern area during the late Glacial Age, and arrived in southern France as the climate improved and became suitable to their accustomed quarry.", "How and where they developed from a lower type of men we have at present no indication.", "A very remarkable discovery of the last five years made in the course of the careful excavation of the four caverns of Mentone by the Prince of Monaco, where as many as sixteen human skeletons of the Pleistocene Age have been brought to light, gives us a new point of view as to the presence of more than one race in Europe in these immensely remote times, as in later periods.", "In one of the caves, and in a position showing them to date from the deepest layer of the middle Pleistocene, or late Glacial Age, two complete skeletons have been found (and may be seen alongside those of the Cromagnon race in the museum at Monaco), which are obviously different from those of both the Neander and the Cromagnon people.", "They have skulls which decidedly resemble that of the modern negro race, so that they have been definitely assigned to a new race hitherto unknown in European caves, and are spoken of as the negroid skeletons and the Grimaldi race. This is indeed a startling fact.", "There was land stretching across the Mediterranean in those days, and these skeletons suggest that already there was a negroid race in Africa, individuals of which had wandered north as far as the maritime Alps.", "[9] Two or three negroid skulls of Neolithic (therefore very much later) Age have been found in Brittany and in Switzerland.", "When we reflect that the negroid skeletons of Mentone and those of the contemporary Neander Men are probably more than 100,000 years old, we are at once impressed with the important conclusion that already in that remote period three great branches of the human race had come into existence—the negroid, the Neander, and probably, at a more distant spot, also the highly developed Cromagnards.", "The origin of the really primitive race of man is thrown back in time by these facts to a still more remote period, in fact, to an earlier geologic epoch.", "And it is to be noted over and above these facts that we have no indication as to where the much later race, the Neolithic Men, came from, nor who were their contemporaries outside the European area; nor again do we know where the historic races who succeeded the Neolithic Men took their origin.", "When other regions of the earth have been examined as carefully as Western Europe has been, we shall no longer be in such complete darkness.", "When one ventures to speculate as to the story of the earliest men in Europe, one can but feel, even after handling the specimens and carefully following the excavations, how small and fragmentary and difficult to interpret is the evidence at present brought to light.", "And yet there the evidence is, gathered with the utmost care and intelligent method, discussed and interpreted by men of rare knowledge and experience, who, after long comparison of contending opinions and the discovery of an ever increasing body of fact, have arrived at a definite certainty as to the sequence of arts, races, animals, and climates which I have given above, and is again summarised in the tabular statement on page 384 _bis_.", "Hereafter these conclusions will be modified and extended by excavations in other parts of the world, at present untouched.", "The one point upon which the best authorities will not commit themselves is the exact, or even approximately exact, number of thousands of years which these events have occupied.", "The whole story, so far as it is at present worked out, is a marvellous result of patient research and scientific reasoning.", "Some of the cave collections upon which it is based are to be seen in London, in the British Museum.", "[Illustration  FIG.", "78.—The skull top of the primitive kind of man from Pleistocene sands in Java, called _Pithecanthropus_.", "One third (linear) of

have become celebrated as those of a monkey like man, and the name Pithecanthropus has been given to the creature to which they belonged.", "This skull top (or cranial roof) is now in Utrecht, and is well known (Fig.", "78).", "It indicates a race of men or men like creatures, with the flatness of skull, receding forehead, and large bony eye ridges, such as we see in the Neander Men and in some South Australians, but greatly exaggerated.", "The skull was so low and flat as greatly to resemble that of the Gibbon, though much larger.", "The volume of the cranial cavity (showing the size of the brain) was about 900 units—far smaller than that of the average Australian—the skull of smallest cavity among living races of men.", "The volume of the brain cavity of the largest ape (gorilla) amounts to about 500 units (cubic centimetres); so that, allowing for rare individual fluctuations of as much as one fourth more or one fourth less (an amount of variation which, great as it is, is definitely known and recorded in specimens of the skulls of human races), we get the following list of cranial capacities or brain sizes, forming a nearly unbroken series between the highest European

list—although the Corrèze specimen allows of a satisfactory measurement of its capacity—for a very curious reason, which is explained in the next chapter.", "FOOTNOTES  [9] In this connection it seems

one’s hands and closely examine it.", "The skull is in the care of my friend, Professor Marcelin Boule, who is at the head of the great collection of remains of extinct animals in the Jardin des Plantes.", "It has been treated by him with great skill so as to render the bone firm and hard, whilst detached portions have been fitted into place, so that it is fairly complete (Fig.", "65).", "The skull was found (together with many bones of the skeleton of the same individual) by two enthusiastic local archæologists buried at such depth and in such position in the cave known as the Chapelle aux Saints as to leave no doubt as to its belonging to one of a race of men contemporary with the mammoth and hairy rhinoceros—a race which inhabited Europe in the great glacial period—called by prehistorians the Moustierian period, which cannot be less than a hundred thousand years behind us, and probably is more.", "The chief importance of this skull lies in the fact not only that its position in the cave deposits, and therefore its relative age, was carefully ascertained, but that it agrees in its very peculiar form with the Neanderthal skull (from the Rhineland), the Spy skulls (Belgium), and the Gibraltar skull.", "It, in fact, confirms the conclusion that at this period the caves of Western Europe were inhabited by a race of men with peculiar skulls, which may be called

"80.—Outline (one third the size of nature) of the skull of the Neander Man from the Chapelle aux Saints, with all fractures and defects made good.", "The bony sockets of the teeth and the teeth themselves (lost and atrophied by inflammatory disease in the actual skull) are here given their full size and healthy condition.", "The lower jaw is seen to be very similar to that from Heidelberg (Fig.", "82).", "From a photograph taken by Professor Marcelin Boule from a cast of the actual skull.", "The cast was made good by modelling upon it the deficient parts.]", "The fact was published some four months ago that the new Corrèze skull agrees with the celebrated skull top (called a calvaria by anatomists) of the Neanderthal (Fig.", "76) in the extraordinary shallowness or absence of dome, in the retreating forehead, the thick prominent eyebrow ridges, and in the excessive lowness, or want of elevation of the back region.", "But further study of the new skull has enabled Professor Boule to show, as he demonstrated to me, that the outline of the new skull looked at from above coincides not merely approximately, but exactly with that of the Neanderthal skull.", "There is the same great length from eyebrows to occiput, and the same great breadth at a series of corresponding regions.", "The curious thing is that both these skulls are of enormous size—a good deal bigger in length and breadth than modern European skulls, and not small and ape like, though they are far shallower (that is, less high in the dome) than any skulls of living men.", "I had, myself, always been astonished by the great breadth and length of the casts of the Neanderthal skull which we possess in England, and supposed that possibly the casts were carelessly made.", "Now Professor Boule shows that both the Neanderthal and the Corrèze skull are so much larger in breadth and length than average European skulls, that in spite of its flat, depressed shape, the Corrèze skull (and consequently the Neanderthal skull, too) has a brain cavity holding 1600 cubic centimetres, whilst the average modern European skull only holds 1500 to 1550.", "The estimate given by former observers for the Neanderthal skull was as low as 1200.", "This calculation was based on the diminution of volume caused by the flatness of the skull, and would be correct were the skull of the Neander race no longer or broader than an ordinary European skull.", "If we imagine a skull of the ordinary European proportionate height, but as long and as broad as the Neander skulls, then its volume would be something like 2000 cubic centimetres.", "This is a very remarkable result.", "The ancient Neander Men’s brain was not smaller, but actually a little bigger than that of modern Europeans; it was bigger in regions where the modern European is small, and smaller where that is large!", "[Illustration  FIG.", "81.—The skull of a male chimpanzee.", "Drawn one third the natural size (linear) to compare with

flatness of the cranial dome and the reduction of the frontal boss (_d_) are very marked.", "So are the relatively large size of the jaws and teeth.", "Compare the shape of the lower jaw with that from Heidelberg (Fig.", "82), and with that of a modern European (Fig.", "79).]", "[Illustration  FIG.", "82.—The Heidelberg jaw, from a lower Pleistocene deposit, near Heidelberg.", "Observe the absence of chin and the great breadth of the up turned part of the jaw.", "Compare with the lower jaws drawn to the same scale in Figs.", "79, 80, and 81.", "One third the size of nature.]", "If we had any sufficient knowledge of the mental qualities which belong to different regions of the brain (if, indeed, such localisation of qualities is possible), we might draw some interesting conclusions from this difference between the two races.", "But unfortunately our knowledge on that matter is very defective.", "We are not in a position to say that length and breadth of the brain either can or cannot compensate (so to speak) for shallowness.", "It is probable that the mental qualities of the two forms of brain were in important respects different, but that is all that can at present be said.", "No accredited brain student would, until more is known, venture to draw conclusions as to mental quality from such facts as mere breadth, length, and depth of the cranial cavity.", "The Corrèze skull has a strongly projecting face, depending not merely on a protrusion of the dentary border of the upper jaw, but on a forward thrust of the entire face.", "This is not shown by the Gibraltar skull (Fig.", "77).", "It is not improbable that this region has been flattened in the Gibraltar skull whilst it was buried in the cave deposit and softened by water.", "The lower jaw is preserved in the new French specimen, and is very remarkable on account of the retreating chin and the lowness and backward flexion of the articular process, as well as for the large size of the surface by which it articulates with the skull.", "All the cheek teeth have been shed (see Fig.", "65), and the sockets closed owing to inflammation, showing that primitive European man was subject to the same trouble with his teeth from which civilised men of to day suffer.", "In comparing the skull with the skulls of modern races, Professor Boule is not inclined to insist much on the resemblance to Australian and Tasmanian skulls presented by the thick and large brow ridges.", "A careful study of the skull is giving to Professor Boule many facts of importance which will be published ere long.", "The articular surfaces or condyles of the skull (for instance) by which it was set on the neck vertebræ are so set that the head must have been habitually carried with a droop like that of an animal, and not poised upright on the neck as in modern races of man.", "Not less important than the skull are some of the bones of the arm and leg.", "Indeed, they show more novel characters than the skull, and definitely distinguish the Neander Men so as to justify us in regarding them as a distinct species, _Homo Neanderthalensis_.", "The thigh bone is very short  as compared with that of a modern European, it is as 14 to 18.", "Also it is thick and _curved_.", "This was already known in the Neander Man of the Spy cave, and its confirmation by the specimen from the Corrèze establishes this shortness of the thigh as a specific character.", "There are also strange features in the articulation of the bones of the thumb and of the heel which Professor Boule will make known when he publishes his full account of this most astonishing skeleton.", "It is worth noting here that another skull of the same race—that of a young individual—was dug out in 1908 at Moustier by Mr.", "Hauser, a Swiss explorer.", "The specimen was broken into many fragments and has not been satisfactorily put together, so that at present it is not possible to say whether it gives any further information as to the Neander Man.", "Also in 1909 the French explorers have found another skull and skeleton of the same age and race at Ferassi, near Moustier, on the Veyzere.", "It has been carefully removed, but not yet studied.", "The bones of the hand and of the foot are complete, and will be available for confirming the observations made on the skeleton of the Chapelle aux Saints.", "We have, a few pages back, noted that behind the Glacial or Moustierian period of the Pleistocene (the second of our list, the Reindeer period being the latest), geologists recognise a third or warm period which is represented by deeper cave deposits and by some of the older sands, clays, and gravels of our river valleys.", "As in the Moustierian deposits, so in these older deposits (called Chellean after a French township) we find abundant large flint implements (Figs.", "73, 74) indicating the presence of man.", "But the animals associated with him were not the mammoth and the hairy rhinoceros; they were the _Elephas antiquus_ and a distinct kind of rhinoceros, and most distinctively the hippopotamus.", "These beds and their animal remains and worked flints occur abundantly in the South of England, and have been more or less mistaken for and confused with the glacial Moustierian deposits which also are common in England.", "No bones or skulls of the men of this Chellean period have been found, excepting a lower jaw, which was not long ago discovered in a deposit of this warmer and earlier age, near Heidelberg (Fig.", "82).", "This jaw bone is remarkably well preserved, and the great difference between it and that of a modern European may be seen by comparing our Figures 79 and 82.", "In the absence of chin, the great breadth of the up turned part of the jaw and the shallowness of the notch separating the condyle or articulating knob from the more forwardly placed coronoid process (a well marked triangular process in the modern European jaw), the Heidelberg jaw differs from the modern European, and resembles that of the chimpanzee (Fig.", "81).", "Dr.", "Schoettensack of Heidelberg, who has described this remarkable jaw bone and has very kindly presented casts of it to the Natural History Museum, to Oxford, to Cambridge, and to myself, was of the opinion that it indicated a distinct race or even a distinct species of man.", "But Professor Marcelin Boule has found that when the lower jaw of the skull from the Chapelle aux Saints is reconstructed, not only by replacing the parts broken away, but by restoring the teeth and the absorbed sockets of the teeth, it comes out very closely identical with the Heidelberg jaw.", "In Fig.", "80 I have reproduced the profile of Professor Boule’s complete restoration of the Chapelle skull, and it will be seen that the lower jaw differs very little from that of the Heidelberg specimen.", "Indeed, Professor Boule has published a photograph in which he attaches the Heidelberg lower jaw to the restored Chapelle skull in place of its own, and the similarity of the two becomes very obvious.", "As will be seen by the drawings which I give here, the Heidelberg jaw is even more powerful than that of the Chapelle skull.", "The lower jaw of a modern European (Fig.", "79), drawn to the same scale as the other two, and as that of the chimpanzee (Fig.", "81), is an elegant little thing with its forwardly projecting chin, its short measurement from front to back, and the narrowness and delicacy of its up turned part or ramus, with its well marked angle at the lower corner and deeply cut upper border between the condyle (hindermost projection with knob) and the coronoid.", "The imperfect lower jaw (without teeth and with the articular condyle broken away) of the Cromagnon skull, drawn in Fig.", "75, should also be compared  it is, though broken, similar to that of the modern European.", "Lower jaws differ in some of the points which we have been looking at, from one another, but there is no known living race of men the lower jaw of which is not far nearer to that of the modern European (Fig.", "79), than to that from the Chapelle aux Saints or from Heidelberg (Fig.", "82); and I may add that the imperfect lower jaw of the Neander man skull, from the Spy Cave in Belgium, agrees in the absence of chin and in other points with that of Heidelberg and of the Chapelle skull.", "There is not sufficient ground afforded by the characters of the lower jaw for considering that the race indicated by the Heidelberg specimen was distinct from the Neander race, as may be seen by comparing Fig.", "80 with Fig.", "82.", "As these pages are going to press, I am able to add that I have seen in Paris a very interesting and striking restoration of the appearance in the flesh or during life of the head of the man of the Chapelle aux Saints, carefully modelled in Professor Boule’s laboratory by a young sculptor, by applying his clay to a cast of the completed restoration of the skull.", "It is, I understand, proposed to publish this restoration firstly as strictly determined by anatomical fact and devoid of hair, and then to add the hair of the scalp, the eyebrows, eyelashes, and beard, and to place artificial eyes in position.", "We shall thus get a representation of this ancient race or species of man, based on the sure foundation of the actual bones.", "Fanciful portraits of primitive man have before to day been produced by some imaginative artists, but this will be the first portrait of him with an inner framework of truth.", "I do not know where I may be when this preface is read.", "As I write it in August 1916, I am at Ebrington Barracks, Londonderry, recovering from a slight wound.", "But it does not greatly matter where I am; my dreams are here before you amongst the following pages; and writing in a day when life is cheap, dreams seem to me all the dearer, the only things that survive.", "Just now the civilization of Europe seems almost to have ceased, and nothing seems to grow in her torn fields but death, yet this is only for a while and dreams will come back again and bloom as of old, all the more radiantly for this terrible ploughing, as the flowers will bloom again where the trenches are and the primroses shelter in shell holes for many seasons, when weeping Liberty has come home to Flanders.", "To some of you in America this may seem an unnecessary and wasteful quarrel, as other people's quarrels often are; but it comes to this that though we are all killed there will be songs again, but if we were to submit and so survive there could be neither songs nor dreams, nor any joyous free things any more.", "And do not regret the lives that are wasted amongst us, or the work that the dead would have done, for war is no accident that man's care could have averted, but is as natural, though not as regular, as the tides; as well regret the things that the tide has washed away, which destroys and cleanses and crumbles, and spares the minutest shells.", "And now I will write nothing further about our war, but offer you these books of dreams from Europe as one throws things of value, if only to oneself, at the last moment out of a burning house.", "DUNSANY.", "A Tale of London  \"Come,\" said the Sultan to his hasheesh eater in the very furthest lands that know Bagdad, \"dream to me now of London.\"", "And the hasheesh eater made a low obeisance and seated himself cross legged upon a purple cushion broidered with golden poppies, on the floor, beside an ivory bowl where the hasheesh was, and having eaten liberally of the hasheesh blinked seven times and spoke thus   \"O Friend of God, know then that London is the desiderate town even of all Earth's cities.", "Its houses are of ebony and cedar which they roof with thin copper plates that the hand of Time turns green.", "They have golden balconies in which amethysts are where they sit and watch the sunset.", "Musicians in the gloaming steal softly along the ways; unheard their feet fall on the white sea sand with which those ways are strewn, and in the darkness suddenly they play on dulcimers and instruments with strings.", "Then are there murmurs in the balconies praising their skill, then are there bracelets cast down to them for reward and golden necklaces and even pearls.", "\"Indeed but the city is fair; there is by the sandy ways a paving all alabaster, and the lanterns along it are of chrysoprase, all night long they shine green, but of amethyst are the lanterns of the balconies.", "\"As the musicians go along the ways dancers gather about them and dance upon the alabaster pavings, for joy and not for hire.", "Sometimes a window opens far up in an ebony palace and a wreath is cast down to a dancer or orchids showered upon them.", "\"Indeed of many cities have I dreamt but of none fairer, through many marble metropolitan gates hasheesh has led me, but London is its secret, the last gate of all; the ivory bowl has nothing more to show.", "And indeed even now the imps that crawl behind me and that will not let me be are plucking me by the elbow and bidding my spirit return, for well they know that I have seen too much.", "'No, not London,' they say; and therefore I will speak of some other city, a city of some less mysterious land, and anger not the imps with forbidden things.", "I will speak of Persepolis or famous Thebes.\"", "A shade of annoyance crossed the Sultan's face, a look of thunder that you had scarcely seen, but in those lands they watched his visage well, and though his spirit was wandering far away and his eyes were bleared with hasheesh yet that storyteller there and then perceived the look that was death, and sent his spirit back at once to London as a man runs into his house when the thunder comes.", "\"And therefore,\" he continued, \"in the desiderate city, in London, all their camels are pure white.", "Remarkable is the swiftness of their horses, that draw their chariots that are of ivory along those sandy ways and that are of surpassing lightness, they have little bells of silver upon their horses' heads.", "O Friend of God, if you perceived their merchants!", "The glory of their dresses in the noonday!", "They are no less gorgeous than those butterflies that float about their streets.", "They have overcloaks of green and vestments of azure, huge purple flowers blaze on their overcloaks, the work of cunning needles, the centres of the flowers are of gold and the petals of purple.", "All their hats are black  \" (\"No, no,\" said the Sultan)  \"but irises are set about the brims, and green plumes float above the crowns of them.", "\"They have a river that is named the Thames, on it their ships go up with violet sails bringing incense for the braziers that perfume the streets, new songs exchanged for gold with alien tribes, raw silver for the statues of their heroes, gold to make balconies where the women sit, great sapphires to reward their poets with, the secrets of old cities and strange lands, the earning of the dwellers in far isles, emeralds, diamonds, and the hoards of the sea.", "And whenever a ship comes into port and furls its violet sails and the news spreads through London that she has come, then all the merchants go down to the river to barter, and all day long the chariots whirl through the streets, and the sound of their going is a mighty roar all day until evening, their roar is even like  \"  \"Not so,\" said the Sultan.", "\"Truth is not hidden from the Friend of God,\" replied the hasheesh eater, \"I have erred being drunken with the hasheesh, for in the desiderate city, even in London, so thick upon the ways is the white sea sand with which the city glimmers that no sound comes from the path of the charioteers, but they go softly like a light sea wind.\"", "(\"It is well,\" said the Sultan.)", "\"They go softly down to the port where the vessels are, and the merchandise in from the sea, amongst the wonders that the sailors show, on land by the high ships, and softly they go though swiftly at evening back to their homes.", "\"O would that the Munificent, the Illustrious, the Friend of God, had even seen these things, had seen the jewellers with their empty baskets, bargaining there by the ships, when the barrels of emeralds came up from the hold.", "Or would that he had seen the fountains there in silver basins in the midst of the ways.", "I have seen small spires upon their ebony houses and the spires were all of gold, birds strutted there upon the copper roofs from golden spire to spire that have no equal for splendour in all the woods of the world.", "And over London the desiderate city the sky is so deep a blue that by this alone the traveller may know where he has come, and may end his fortunate journey.", "Nor yet for any colour of the sky is there too great heat in London, for along its ways a wind blows always from the South gently and cools the city.", "\"Such, O Friend of God, is indeed the city of London, lying very far off on the yonder side of Bagdad, without a peer for beauty or excellence of its ways among the towns of the earth or cities of song; and even so, as I have told, its fortunate citizens dwell, with their hearts ever devising beautiful things and from the beauty of their own fair work that is more abundant around them every year, receiving new inspirations to work things more beautiful yet.\"", "\"And is their government good?\"", "the Sultan said.", "\"It is most good,\" said the hasheesh eater, and fell backwards upon the floor.", "He lay thus and was silent.", "And when the Sultan perceived he would speak no more that night he smiled and lightly applauded.", "And there was envy in that palace, in lands beyond Bagdad, of all that dwell in London.", "Thirteen at Table  In front of a spacious fireplace of the old kind, when the logs were well alight, and men with pipes and glasses were gathered before it in great easeful chairs, and the wild weather outside and the comfort that was within, and the season of the year  for it was Christmas  and the hour of the night, all called for the weird or uncanny, then out spoke the ex master of foxhounds and told this tale.", "I once had an odd experience too.", "It was when I had the Bromley and Sydenham, the year I gave them up  as a matter of fact it was the last day of the season.", "It was no use going on because there were no foxes left in the county, and London was sweeping down on us.", "You could see it from the kennels all along the skyline like a terrible army in grey, and masses of villas every year came skirmishing down our valleys.", "Our coverts were mostly on the hills, and as the town came down upon the valleys the foxes used to leave them and go right away out of the county and they never returned.", "I think they went by night and moved great distances.", "Well it was early April and we had drawn blank all day, and at the last draw of all, the very last of the season, we found a fox.", "He left the covert with his back to London and its railways and villas and wire and slipped away towards the chalk country and open Kent.", "I felt as I once felt as a child on one summer's day when I found a door in a garden where I played left luckily ajar, and I pushed it open and the wide lands were before me and waving fields of corn.", "We settled down into a steady gallop and the fields began to drift by under us, and a great wind arose full of fresh breath.", "We left the clay lands where the bracken grows and came to a valley at the edge of the chalk.", "As we went down into it we saw the fox go up the other side like a shadow that crosses the evening, and glide into a wood that stood on the top.", "We saw a flash of primroses in the wood and we were out the other side, hounds hunting perfectly and the fox still going absolutely straight.", "It began to dawn on me then that we were in for a great hunt, I took a deep breath when I thought of it; the taste of the air of that perfect Spring afternoon as it came to one galloping, and the thought of a great run, were together like some old rare wine.", "Our faces now were to another valley, large fields led down to it, with easy hedges, at the bottom of it a bright blue stream went singing and a rambling village smoked, the sunlight on the opposite slopes danced like a fairy; and all along the top old woods were frowning, but they dreamed of Spring.", "The \"field\" had fallen of and were far behind and my only human companion was James, my old first whip, who had a hound's instinct, and a personal animosity against a fox that even embittered his speech.", "Across the valley the fox went as straight as a railway line, and again we went without a check straight through the woods at the top.", "I remember hearing men sing or shout as they walked home from work, and sometimes children whistled; the sounds came up from the village to the woods at the top of the valley.", "After that we saw no more villages, but valley after valley arose and fell before us as though we were voyaging some strange and stormy sea, and all the way before us the fox went dead up wind like the fabulous Flying Dutchman.", "There was no one in sight now but my first whip and me, we had both of us got on to our second horses as we drew the last covert.", "Two or three times we checked in those great lonely valleys beyond the village, but I began to have inspirations, I felt a strange certainty within me that this fox was going on straight up wind till he died or until night came and we could hunt no longer, so I reversed ordinary methods and only cast straight ahead and always we picked up the scent again at once.", "I believe that this fox was the last one left in the villa haunted lands and that he was prepared to leave them for remote uplands far from men, that if we had come the following day he would not have been there, and that we just happened to hit off his journey.", "Evening began to descend upon the valleys, still the hounds drifted on, like the lazy but unresting shadows of clouds upon a summer's day, we heard a shepherd calling to his dog, we saw two maidens move towards a hidden farm, one of them singing softly; no other sounds, but ours, disturbed the leisure and the loneliness of haunts that seemed not yet to have known the inventions of steam and gun powder (even as China, they say, in some of her further mountains does not yet know that she has fought Japan).", "And now the day and our horses were wearing out, but that resolute fox held on.", "I began to work out the run and to wonder where we were.", "The last landmark I had ever seen before must have been over five miles back and from there to the start was at least ten miles more.", "If only we could kill!", "Then the sun set.", "I wondered what chance we had of killing our fox.", "I looked at James' face as he rode beside me.", "He did not seem to have lost any confidence yet his horse was as tired as mine.", "It was a good clear twilight and the scent was as strong as ever, and the fences were easy enough, but those valleys were terribly trying and they still rolled on and on.", "It looked as if the light would outlast all possible endurance both of the fox and the horses, if the scent held good and he did not go to ground, otherwise night would end it.", "For long we had seen no houses and no roads, only chalk slopes with the twilight on them, and here and there some sheep, and scattered copses darkening in the evening.", "At some moment I seemed to realise all at once that the light was spent and that darkness was hovering, I looked at James, he was solemnly shaking his head.", "Suddenly in a little wooded valley we saw climb over the oaks the red brown gables of a queer old house, at that instant I saw the fox scarcely heading by fifty yards.", "We blundered through a wood into full sight of the house, but no avenue led up to it or even a path nor were there any signs of wheel marks anywhere.", "Already lights shone here and there in windows.", "We were in a park, and a fine park, but unkempt beyond credibility; brambles grew everywhere.", "It was too dark to see the fox any more but we knew he was dead beat, the hounds were just before us,  and a four foot railing of oak.", "I shouldn't have tried it on a fresh horse the beginning of a run, and here was a horse near his last gasp.", "But what a run!", "an event standing out in a lifetime, and the hounds close up on their fox, slipping into the darkness as I hesitated.", "I decided to try it.", "My horse rose about eight inches and took it fair with his breast, and the oak log flew into handfuls of wet decay  it rotten with years.", "And then we were on a lawn and at the far end of it the hounds were tumbling over their fox.", "Fox, hounds and light were all done together at the of a twenty mile point.", "We made some noise then, but nobody came out of the queer old house.", "I felt pretty stiff as I walked round to the hall door with the mask and the brush while James went with the hounds and the two horses to look for the stables.", "I rang a bell marvellously encrusted with rust, and after a long while the door opened a little way revealing a hall with much old armour in it and the shabbiest butler that I have ever known.", "I asked him who lived there.", "Sir Richard Arlen.", "I explained that my horse could go no further that night and that I wished to ask Sir Richard Arlen for a bed for the night.", "\"O, no one ever comes here, sir,\" said the butler.", "I pointed out that I had come.", "\"I don't think it would be possible, sir,\" he said.", "This annoyed me and I asked to see Sir Richard, and insisted until he came.", "Then I apologised and explained the situation.", "He looked only fifty, but a 'Varsity oar on the wall with the date of the early seventies, made him older than that; his face had something of the shy look of the hermit; he regretted that he had not room to put me up.", "I was sure that this was untrue, also I had to be put up there, there was nowhere else within miles, so I almost insisted.", "Then to my astonishment he turned to the butler and they talked it over in an undertone.", "At last they seemed to think that they could manage it, though clearly with reluctance.", "It was by now seven o' clock and Sir Richard told me he dined at half past seven.", "There was no question of clothes for me other than those I stood in, as my host was shorter and broader.", "He showed me presently to the drawing room and there he reappeared before half past seven in evening dress and a white waistcoat.", "The drawing room was large and contained old furniture but it was rather worn than venerable, an Aubusson carpet flapped about the floor, the wind seemed momently to enter the room, and old draughts haunted corners; the stealthy feet of rats that were never at rest indicated the extent of the ruin that time had wrought in the wainscot; somewhere far off a shutter flapped to and fro, the guttering candles were insufficient to light so large a room.", "The gloom that these things suggested was quite in keeping with Sir Richard's first remark to me after he entered the room  \"I must tell you, sir, that I have led a wicked life.", "O, a very wicked life.\"", "Such confidences from a man much older than oneself after one has known him for half an hour are so rare that any possible answer merely does not suggest itself.", "I said rather slowly, \"O, really,\" and chiefly to forestall another such remark I said \"What a charming house you have.\"", "\"Yes,\" he said, \"I have not left it for nearly forty years.", "Since I left the 'Varsity.", "One is young there, you know, and one has opportunities; but I make no excuses, no excuses.\"", "And the door slipping its rusty latch, came drifting on the draught into the room, and the long carpet flapped and the hangings upon the walls, then the draught fell rustling away and the door slammed to again.", "\"Ah, Marianne,\" he said, \"we have a guest to night.", "Mr.", "Linton.", "This is Marianne Gib.\"", "And everything became clear to me.", "\"Mad,\" I said to myself, for no one had entered the room.", "The rats ran up the length of the room behind the wainscot ceaselessly, and the wind unlatched the door again and the folds of the carpet fluttered up to our feet and stopped there, for our weight held it down.", "\"Let me introduce Mr.", "Linton,\" said my host  \"Lady Mary Errinjer.\"", "The door slammed back again.", "I bowed politely.", "Even had I been invited I should have humoured him, but it was the very least that an uninvited guest could do.", "This kind of thing happened eleven times, the rustling, and the fluttering of the carpet and the footsteps of the rats, and the restless door, and then the sad voice of my host introducing me to phantoms.", "Then for some while we waited while I struggled with the situation; conversation flowed slowly.", "And again the draught came trailing up the room, while the flaring candles filled it with hurrying shadows.", "\"Ah, late again, Cicely,\" said my host in his soft, mournful way.", "\"Always late, Cicely.\"", "Then I went down to dinner with that man and his mind and the twelve phantoms that haunted it.", "I found a long table with fine old silver on it and places laid for fourteen.", "The butler was now in evening dress, there were fewer draughts in the dining room, the scene was less gloomy there.", "\"Will you sit next to Rosalind at the other end,\" Richard said to me.", "\"She always takes the head of the table, I wronged her most of all.\"", "I said, \"I shall be delighted.\"", "I looked at the butler closely, but never did I see by any expression of his face or by anything that he did any suggestion that he waited upon less than fourteen people in the complete possession of all their faculties.", "Perhaps a dish appeared to be refused more often than taken but every glass was equally filled with champagne.", "At first I found little to say, but when Sir Richard speaking from the far end of the table said, \"You are tired, Mr.", "Linton,\" I was reminded that I owed something to a host upon whom I had forced myself.", "It was excellent champagne and with the help of a second glass I made the effort to begin a conversation with a Miss Helen Errold for whom the place upon one side of me was laid.", "It came more easy to me very soon, I frequently paused in my monologue, like Mark Anthony, for a reply, and sometimes I turned and spoke to Miss Rosalind Smith.", "Sir Richard at the other end talked sorrowfully on, he spoke as a condemned man might speak to his judge, and yet somewhat as a judge might speak to one that he once condemned wrongly.", "My own mind began to turn to mournful things.", "I drank another glass of champagne, but I was still thirsty.", "I felt as if all the moisture in my body had been blown away over the downs of Kent by the wind up which we had galloped.", "Still I was not talking enough; my host was looking at me.", "I made another effort, after all I had something to talk about, a twenty mile point is not often seen in a lifetime, especially south of the Thames.", "I began to describe the run to Rosalind Smith.", "I could see then that my host was pleased, the sad look in his face gave a kind of a flicker, like mist upon the mountains on a miserable day when a faint puff comes from the sea and the mist would lift if it could.", "And the butler refilled my glass very attentively.", "I asked her first if she hunted, and paused and began my story.", "I told her where we had found the fox and how fast and straight he had gone, and how I had got through the village by keeping to the road, while the little gardens and wire, and then the river, had stopped the rest of the field.", "I told her the kind of country that we crossed and how splendid it looked in the Spring, and how mysterious the valleys were as soon as the twilight came, and what a glorious horse I had and how wonderfully he went.", "I was so fearfully thirsty after the great hunt that I had to stop for a moment now and then, but I went on with my description of that famous run, for I had warmed to the subject, and after all there was nobody to tell of it but me except my old whipper in, and \"the old fellow's probably drunk by now,\" I thought.", "I described to her minutely the exact spot in the run at which it had come to me clearly that this was going to be the greatest hunt in the whole history of Kent.", "Sometimes I forgot incidents that had happened as one well may in a run of twenty miles, and then I had to fill in the gaps by inventing.", "I was pleased to be able to make the party go off well by means of my conversation, and besides that the lady to whom I was speaking was extremely pretty  I do not mean in a flesh and blood kind of way but there were little shadowy lines about the chair beside me that hinted at an unusually graceful figure when Miss Rosalind Smith was alive; and I began to perceive that what I first mistook for the smoke of guttering candles and a table cloth waving in the draught was in reality an extremely animated company who listened, and not without interest, to my story of by far the greatest hunt that the world had ever known  indeed I told them that I would confidently go further and predict that never in the history of the world would there be such a run again.", "Only my throat was terribly dry.", "And then as it seemed they wanted to hear more about my horse.", "I had forgotten that I had come there on a horse, but when they reminded me it all came back; they looked so charming leaning over the table intent upon what I said, that I told them everything they wanted to know.", "Everything was going so pleasantly if only Sir Richard would cheer up.", "I heard his mournful voice every now and then  these were very pleasant people if only he would take them the right way.", "I could understand that he regretted his past, but the early seventies seemed centuries away and I felt sure that he misunderstood these ladies, they were not revengeful as he seemed to suppose.", "I wanted to show him how cheerful they really were, and so I made a joke and they an laughed at it, and then I chaffed them a bit, especially Rosalind, and nobody resented it in the very least.", "And still Sir Richard sat there with that unhappy look, like one that has ended weeping because it is vain and has not the consolation even of tears.", "We had been a long time there and many of the candles had burned out, but there was light enough.", "I was glad to have an audience for my exploit, and being happy myself I was determined Sir Richard should be.", "I made more jokes and they still laughed good naturedly; some of the jokes were a little broad perhaps but no harm was meant.", "And then  I do not wish to excuse myself  but I had had a harder day than I ever had had before and without knowing it I must have been completely exhausted; in this state the champagne had found me, and what would have been harmless at any other time must somehow have got the better of me when quite tired out  anyhow I went too far, I made some joke  I cannot in the least remember what  that suddenly seemed to offend them.", "I felt all at once a commotion in the air, I looked up and saw that they had all arisen from the table and were sweeping towards the door  I had not time to open it but it blew open on a wind, I could scarcely see what Sir Richard was doing because only two candles were left, I think the rest blew out when the ladies suddenly rose.", "I sprang up to apologise, to assure them  and then fatigue overcame me as it had overcome my horse at the last fence, I clutched at the table but the cloth came away and then I fell.", "The fall, and the darkness on the floor and the pent up fatigue of the day overcame me all three together.", "The sun shone over glittering fields and in at a bedroom window and thousands of birds were chanting to the Spring, and there I was in an old four poster bed in a quaint old panelled bedroom, fully dressed and wearing long muddy boots; someone had taken my spurs and that was all.", "For a moment I failed to realise and then it all came back, my enormity and the pressing need of an abject apology to Sir Richard.", "I pulled an embroidered bell rope until the butler came.", "He came in perfectly cheerful and indescribably shabby.", "I asked him if Sir Richard was up, and he said he had just gone down, and told me to my amazement that it was twelve o'clock.", "I asked to be shown in to Sir Richard at once.", "He was in his smoking room.", "\"Good morning,\" he said cheerfully the moment I went in.", "I went directly to the matter in hand.", "\"I fear that I insulted some ladies in your house  \" I began.", "\"You did indeed,\" he said, \"You did indeed.\"", "And then he burst into tears and took me by the hand.", "\"How can I ever thank you?\"", "he said to me then.", "\"We have been thirteen at table for thirty years and I never dared to insult them because I had wronged them all, and now you have done it and I know they will never dine here again.\"", "And for a long time he still held my hand, and then he gave it a grip and a kind of a shake which I took to mean \"Goodbye\" and I drew my hand away then and left the house.", "And I found James in the stables with the hounds and asked him how he had fared, and James, who is a man of very few words, said he could not rightly remember, and I got my spurs from the butler and climbed on to my horse and slowly we rode away from that queer old house, and slowly we wended home, for the hounds were footsore but happy and the horses were tired still.", "And when we recalled that the hunting season was ended we turned our faces to Spring and thought of the new things that try to replace the old.", "And that very year I heard, and have often heard since, of dances and happier dinners at Sir Richard Arlen's house.", "The City on Mallington Moor  Besides the old shepherd at Lingwold whose habits render him unreliable I am probably the only person that has ever seen the city on Mallington Moor.", "I had decided one year to do no London season; partly because of the ugliness of the things in the shops, partly because of the unresisted invasions of German bands, partly perhaps because some pet parrots in the oblong where I lived had learned to imitate cab whistles; but chiefly because of late there had seized me in London a quite unreasonable longing for large woods and waste spaces, while the very thought of little valleys underneath copses full of bracken and foxgloves was a torment to me and every summer in London the longing grew worse till the thing was becoming intolerable.", "So I took a stick and a knapsack and began walking northwards, starting at Tetherington and sleeping at inns, where one could get real salt, and the waiter spoke English and where one had a name instead of a number; and though the tablecloth might be dirty the windows opened so that the air was clean, where one had the excellent company of farmers and men of the wold, who could not be thoroughly vulgar, because they had not the money to be so even if they had wished it.", "At first the novelty was delightful, and then one day in a queer old inn up Uthering way, beyond Lingwold, I heard for the first time the rumour of the city said to be on Mallington Moor.", "They spoke of it quite casually over their glasses of beer, two farmers at the inn.", "\"They say the queer folk be at Mallington with their city,\" one farmer said.", "\"Travelling they seem to be,\" said the other.", "And more came in then and the rumour spread.", "And then, such are the contradictions of our little likes and dislikes and all the whims that drive us, that I, who had come so far to avoid cities, had a great longing all of a sudden for throngs again and the great hives of Man, and then and there determined on that bright Sunday morning to come to Mallington and there search for the city that rumour spoke of so strangely.", "Mallington Moor, from all that they said of it, was hardly a likely place to find a thing by searching.", "It was a huge high moor, very bleak and desolate and altogether trackless.", "It seemed a lonely place from what they said.", "The Normans when they came had called it Mal Lieu and afterwards Mallintown and so it changed to Mallington.", "Though what a town can ever have had to do with a place so utterly desolate I do not know.", "And before that some say that the Saxons called it Baplas, which I believe to be a corruption of Bad Place.", "And beyond the mere rumour of a beautiful city all of white marble and with a foreign look up on Mallington Moor, beyond this I could not get.", "None of them had seen it himself, \"only heard of it like,\" and my questions, rather than stimulating conversation, would always stop it abruptly.", "I was no more fortunate on the road to Mallington until the Tuesday, when I was quite near it; I had been walking two days from the inn where I had heard the rumour and could see the great hill steep as a headland on which Mallington lay, standing up on the skyline  the hill was covered with grass, where anything grew at all, but Mallington Moor is all heather; it is just marked Moor on the map; nobody goes there and they do not trouble to name it.", "It was there where the gaunt hill first came into sight, by the roadside as I enquired for the marble city of some labourers by the way, that I was directed, partly I think in derision, to the old shepherd of Lingwold.", "It appeared that he, following sometimes sheep that had strayed, and wandering far from Lingwold, came sometimes up to the edge of Mallington Moor, and that he would come back from these excursions and shout through the villages, raving of a city of white marble and gold tipped minarets.", "And hearing me asking questions of this city they had laughed and directed me to the shepherd of Lingwold.", "One well meant warning they gave me as I went  the old man was not reliable.", "And late that evening I saw the thatches of Lingwold sheltering under the edge of that huge hill that Atlas like held up those miles of moor to the great winds and heaven.", "They knew less of the city in Lingwold than elsewhere but they knew the whereabouts of the man I wanted, though they seemed a little ashamed of him.", "There was an inn in Lingwold that gave me shelter, whence in the morning, equipped with purchases, I set out to find their shepherd.", "And there he was on the edge of Mallington Moor standing motionless, gazing stupidly at his sheep; his hands trembled continually and his eyes had a blear look, but he was quite sober, wherein all Lingwold had wronged him.", "And then and there I asked him of the city and he said he had never heard tell of any such place.", "And I said, \"Come, come, you must pull yourself together.\"", "And he looked angrily at me; but when he saw me draw from amongst my purchases a full bottle of whiskey and a big glass he became more friendly.", "As I poured out the whiskey I asked him again about the marble city on Mallington Moor but he seemed quite honestly to know nothing about it.", "The amount of whiskey he drank was quite incredible, but I seldom express surprise and once more I asked him the way to the wonderful city.", "His hand was steadier now and his eyes more intelligent and he said that he had heard something of some such city, but his memory was evidently blurred and he was still unable to give me useful directions.", "I consequently gave him another tumbler, which he drank off like the first without any water, and almost at once he was a different man.", "The trembling in his hands stopped altogether, his eye became as quick as a younger man's, he answered my questions readily and frankly, and, what was more important to me still, his old memory became alert and clear for even minutest details.", "His gratitude to myself I need not mention, for I make no pretence that I bought the bottle of whiskey that the old shepherd enjoyed so much without at least some thought of my own advantage.", "Yet it was pleasant to reflect that it was due to me that he had pulled himself together and steadied his shaking hand and cleared his mind, recovered his memory and his self respect.", "He spoke to me quite clearly, no longer slurring his words; he had seen the city first one moonlight night when he was lost in the mist on the big moor, he had wandered far in the mist, and when it lifted he saw the city by moonlight.", "He had no food, but luckily had his flask.", "There never was such a city, not even in books.", "Travellers talked sometimes of Venice seen from the sea, there might be such a place or there might not, but, whether or no, it was nothing to the city on Mallington Moor.", "Men who read books had talked to him in his time, hundreds of books, but they never could tell of any city like this.", "Why, the place was all of marble, roads, walls and palaces, all pure white marble, and the tops of the tall thin spires were entirely of gold.", "And they were queer folk in the city even for foreigners.", "And there were camels, but I cut him short for I thought I could judge for myself, if there was such a place, and, if not, I was wasting my time as well as a pint of good whiskey.", "So I got him to speak of the way, and after more circumlocution than I needed and more talk of the city he pointed to a tiny track on the black earth just beside us, a little twisty way you could hardly see.", "I said the moor was trackless; untrodden of man or dog it certainly was and seemed to have less to do with the ways of man than any waste I have seen, but the track the old shepherd showed me, if track it was, was no more than the track of a hare  an elf path the old man called it, Heaven knows what he meant.", "And then before I left him he insisted on giving me his flask with the queer strong rum it contained.", "Whiskey brings out in some men melancholy, in some rejoicing, with him it was clearly generosity and he insisted until I took his rum, though I did not mean to drink it.", "It was lonely up there, he said, and bitter cold and the city hard to find, being set in a hollow, and I should need the rum, and he had never seen the marble city except on days when he had had his flask  he seemed to regard that rusted iron flask as a sort of mascot, and in the end I took it.", "I followed that odd, faint track on the black earth under the heather till I came to the big grey stone beyond the horizon, where the track divides into two, and I took the one to the left as the old man told me.", "I knew by another stone that I saw far off that I had not lost my way, nor the old man lied.", "And just as I hoped to see the city's ramparts before the gloaming fell on that desolate place, I suddenly saw a long high wall of whiteness with pinnacles here and there thrown up above it, floating towards me silent and grim as a secret, and knew it for that evil thing the mist.", "The sun, though low, was shining on every sprig of heather, the green and scarlet mosses were shining with it too, it seemed incredible that in three minutes' time all those colours would be gone and nothing left all round but a grey darkness.", "I gave up hope of finding the city that day, a broader path than mine could have been quite easily lost.", "I hastily chose for my bed a thick patch of heather, wrapped myself in a waterproof cloak, and lay down and made myself comfortable.", "And then the mist came.", "It came like the careful pulling of lace curtains, then like the drawing of grey blinds; it shut out the horizon to the north, then to the east and west; it turned the whole sky white and hid the moor; it came down on it like a metropolis, only utterly silent, silent and white as tombstones.", "And then I was glad of that strange strong rum, or whatever it was in the flask that the shepherd gave me, for I did not think that the mist would clear till night, and I feared the night would be cold.", "So I nearly emptied the flask; and, sooner than I expected, I fell asleep, for the first night out as a rule one does not sleep at once but is kept awake some while by the little winds and the unfamiliar sound of the things that wander at night, and that cry to one another far off with their queer, faint voices; one misses them afterwards when one gets to houses again.", "But I heard none of these sounds in the mist that evening.", "And then I woke and found that the mist was gone and the sun was just disappearing under the moor, and I knew that I had not slept for as long as I thought.", "And I decided to go on while I could, for I thought that I was not very far from the city.", "I went on and on along the twisty track, bits of the mist came down and filled the hollows but lifted again at once so that I saw my way.", "The twilight faded as I went, a star appeared, and I was able to see the track no longer.", "I could go no further that night, yet before I lay down to sleep I decided to go and look over the edge of a wide depression in the moor that I saw a little way off.", "So I left the track and walked a few hundred yards, and when I got to the edge the hollow was full of mist all white underneath me.", "Another star appeared and a cold wind arose, and with the wind the mist flapped away like a curtain.", "And there was the city.", "Nothing the shepherd had said was the least untrue or even exaggerated.", "The poor old man had told the simple truth, there is not a city like it in the world.", "What he had called thin spires were minarets, but the little domes on the top were clearly pure gold as he said.", "There were the marble terraces he described and the pure white palaces covered with carving and hundreds of minarets.", "The city was obviously of the East and yet where there should have been crescents on the domes of the minarets there were golden suns with rays, and wherever one looked one saw things that obscured its origin.", "I walked down to it, and, passing through a wicket gate of gold in a low wall of white marble, I entered the city.", "The heather went right up to the city's edge and beat against the marble wall whenever the wind blew it.", "Lights began to twinkle from high windows of blue glass as I walked up the white street, beautiful copper lanterns were lit up and let down from balconies by silver chains, from doors ajar came the sound of voices singing, and then I saw the men.", "Their faces were rather grey than black, and they wore beautiful robes of coloured silk with hems embroidered with gold and some with copper, and sometimes pacing down the marble ways with golden baskets hung on each side of them I saw the camels of which the old shepherd spoke.", "The people had kindly faces, but, though they were evidently friendly to strangers, I could not speak with them being ignorant of their language, nor were the sounds of the syllables they used like any language I had ever heard  they sounded more like grouse.", "When I tried to ask them by signs whence they had come with their city they would only point to the moon, which was bright and full and was shining fiercely on those marble ways till the city danced in light.", "And now there began appearing one by one, slipping softly out through windows, men with stringed instruments in the balconies.", "They were strange instruments with huge bulbs of wood, and they played softly on them and very beautifully, and their queer voices softly sang to the music weird dirges of the griefs of their native land wherever that may be.", "And far off in the heart of the city others were singing too, the sound of it came to me wherever I roamed, not loud enough to disturb my thoughts, but gently turning the mind to pleasant things.", "Slender carved arches of marble, as delicate almost as lace, crossed and re crossed the ways wherever I went.", "There was none of that hurry of which foolish cities boast, nothing ugly or sordid so far as I could see.", "I saw that it was a city of beauty and song.", "I wondered how they had travelled with all that marble, how they had laid it down on Mallington Moor, whence they had come and what their resources were, and determined to investigate closely next morning, for the old shepherd had not troubled his head to think how the city came, he had only noted that the city was there (and of course no one believed him, though that is partly his fault for his dissolute ways).", "But at night one can see little and I had walked all day, so I determined to find a place to rest in.", "And just as I was wondering whether to ask for shelter of those silk robed men by signs or whether to sleep outside the walls and enter again in the morning, I came to a great archway in one of the marble houses with two black curtains, embroidered below with gold, hanging across it.", "Over the archway were carved apparently in many tongues the words  \"Here strangers rest.\"", "In Greek, Latin and Spanish the sentence was repeated and there was writing also in the language that you see on the walls of the great temples of Egypt, and Arabic and what I took to be early Assyrian and one or two languages I had never seen.", "I entered through the curtains and found a tesselated marble court with golden braziers burning sleepy incense swinging by chains from the roof, all round the walls were comfortable mattresses lying upon the floor covered with cloths and silks.", "It must have been ten o'clock and I was tired.", "Outside the music still softly filled the streets, a man had set a lantern down on the marble way, five or six sat down round him, and he was sonorously telling them a story.", "Inside there were some already asleep on the beds, in the middle of the wide court under the braziers a woman dressed in blue was singing very gently, she did not move, but sung on and on, I never heard a song that was so soothing.", "I lay down on one of the mattresses by the wall, which was all inlaid with mosaics, and pulled over me some of the cloths with their beautiful alien work, and almost immediately my thoughts seemed part of the song that the woman was singing in the midst of the court under the golden braziers that hung from the high roof, and the song turned them to dreams, and so I fell asleep.", "A small wind having arisen, I was awakened by a sprig of heather that beat continually against my face.", "It was morning on Mallington Moor, and the city was quite gone.", "Why the Milkman Shudders When He Perceives the Dawn  In the Hall of the Ancient Company of Milkmen round the great fireplace at the end, when the winter logs are burning and all the craft are assembled they tell to day, as their grandfathers told before them, why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn.", "When dawn comes creeping over the edges of hills, peers through the tree trunks making wonderful shadows, touches the tops of tall columns of smoke going up from awakening cottages in the valleys, and breaks all golden over Kentish fields, when going on tip toe thence it comes to the walls of London and slips all shyly up those gloomy streets the milkman perceives it and shudders.", "A man may be a Milkman's Working Apprentice, may know what borax is and how to mix it, yet not for that is the story told to him.", "There are five men alone that tell that story, five men appointed by the Master of the Company, by whom each place is filled as it falls vacant, and if you do not hear it from one of them you hear the story from no one and so can never know why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn.", "It is the way of one of these five men, greybeards all and milkmen from infancy, to rub his hands by the fire when the great logs burn, and to settle himself more easily in his chair, perhaps to sip some drink far other than milk, then to look round to see that none are there to whom it would not be fitting the tale should be told and, looking from face to face and seeing none but the men of the Ancient Company, and questioning mutely the rest of the five with his eyes, if some of the five be there, and receiving their permission, to cough and to tell the tale.", "And a great hush falls in the Hall of the Ancient Company, and something about the shape of the roof and the rafters makes the tale resonant all down the hall so that the youngest hears it far away from the fire and knows, and dreams of the day when perhaps he will tell himself why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn.", "Not as one tells some casual fact is it told, nor is it commented on from man to man, but it is told by that great fire only and when the occasion and the stillness of the room and the merit of the wine and the profit of all seem to warrant it in the opinion of the five deputed men  then does one of them tell it, as I have said, not heralded by any master of ceremonies but as though it arose out of the warmth of the fire before which his knotted hands would chance to be; not a thing learned by rote, but told differently by each teller, and differently according to his mood, yet never has one of them dared to alter its salient points, there is none so base among the Company of Milkmen.", "The Company of Powderers for the Face know of this story and have envied it, the Worthy Company of Chin Barbers, and the Company of Whiskerers; but none have heard it in the Milkmen's Hall, through whose wall no rumour of the secret goes, and though they have invented tales of their own Antiquity mocks them.", "This mellow story was ripe with honourable years when milkmen wore beaver hats, its origin was still mysterious when smocks were the vogue, men asked one another when Stuarts were on the throne (and only the Ancient Company knew the answer) why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn.", "It is all for envy of this tale's reputation that the Company of Powderers for the Face have invented the tale that they too tell of an evening, \"Why the Dog Barks when he hears the step of the Baker\"; and because probably all men know that tale the Company of the Powderers for the Face have dared to consider it famous.", "Yet it lacks mystery and is not ancient, is not fortified with classical allusion, has no secret lore, is common to all who care for an idle tale, and shares with \"The Wars of the Elves,\" the Calf butcher's tale, and \"The Story of the Unicorn and the Rose,\" which is the tale of the Company of Horse drivers, their obvious inferiority.", "But unlike all these tales so new to time, and many another that the last two centuries tell, the tale that the milkmen tell ripples wisely on, so full of quotation from the profoundest writers, so full of recondite allusion, so deeply tinged with all the wisdom of man and instructive with the experience of all times that they that hear it in the Milkmen's Hall as they interpret allusion after allusion and trace obscure quotation lose idle curiosity and forget to question why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn.", "You also, O my reader, give not yourself up to curiosity.", "Consider of how many it is the bane.", "Would you to gratify this tear away the mystery from the Milkmen's Hall and wrong the Ancient Company of Milkmen?", "Would they if all the world knew it and it became a common thing to tell that tale any more that they have told for the last four hundred years?", "Rather a silence would settle upon their hall and a universal regret for the ancient tale and the ancient winter evenings.", "And though curiosity were a proper consideration yet even then this is not the proper place nor this the proper occasion for the Tale.", "For the proper place is only the Milkmen's Hall and the proper occasion only when logs burn well and when wine has been deeply drunken, then when the candles were burning well in long rows down to the dimness, down to the darkness and mystery that lie at the end of the hall, then were you one of the Company, and were I one of the five, would I rise from my seat by the fireside and tell you with all the embellishments that it has gleaned from the ages that story that is the heirloom of the milkmen.", "And the long candles would burn lower and lower and gutter and gutter away till they liquefied in their sockets, and draughts would blow from the shadowy end of the hall stronger and stronger till the shadows came after them, and still I would hold you with that treasured story, not by any wit of mine but all for the sake of its glamour and the times out of which it came; one by one the candles would flare and die and, when all were gone, by the light of ominous sparks when each milkman's face looks fearful to his fellow, you would know, as now you cannot, why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn.", "The Bad Old Woman in Black  The bad old woman in black ran down the street of the ox butchers.", "Windows at once were opened high up in those crazy gables; heads were thrust out  it was she.", "Then there arose the counsel of anxious voices, calling sideways from window to window or across to opposite houses.", "Why was she there with her sequins and bugles and old black gown?", "Why had she left her dreaded house?", "On what fell errand she hasted?", "They watched her lean, lithe figure, and the wind in that old black dress, and soon she was gone from the cobbled street and under the town's high gateway.", "She turned at once to her right and was hid from the view of the houses.", "Then they all ran down to their doors, and small groups formed on the pavement; there they took counsel together, the eldest speaking first.", "Of what they had seen they said nothing, for there was no doubt it was she; it was of the future they spoke, and the future only.", "In what notorious thing would her errand end?", "What gains had tempted her out from her fearful home?", "What brilliant but sinful scheme had her genius planned?", "Above all, what future evil did this portend?", "Thus at first it was only questions.", "And then the old grey beards spoke, each one to a little group; they had seen her out before, had known her when she was younger, and had noted the evil things that had followed her goings  the small groups listened well to their low and earnest voices.", "No one asked questions now or guessed at her infamous errand, but listened only to the wise old men who knew the things that had been, and who told the younger men of the dooms that had come before.", "Nobody knew how many times she had left her dreaded house; but the oldest recounted all the times that they knew, and the way she had gone each time, and the doom that had followed her going; and two could remember the earthquake that there was in the street of the shearers.", "So were there many tales of the times that were, told on the pavement near the old green doors by the edge of the cobbled street, and the experience that the aged men had bought with their white hairs might be had cheap by the young.", "But from all their experience only this was clear, that never twice in their lives had she done the same infamous thing, and that the same calamity twice had never followed her goings.", "Therefore it seemed that means were doubtful and few for finding out what thing was about to befall; and an ominous feeling of gloom came down on the street of the ox butchers.", "And in the gloom grew fears of the very worst.", "This comfort they only had when they put their fear into words  that the doom that followed her goings had never yet been anticipated.", "One feared that with magic she meant to move the moon; and he would have dammed the high tide on the neighbouring coast, knowing that as the moon attracted the sea the sea must attract the moon, and hoping by his device to humble her spells.", "Another would have fetched iron bars and clamped them across the street, remembering the earthquake there was in the street of the shearers.", "Another would have honoured his household gods, the little cat faced idols seated above his hearth, gods to whom magic was no unusual thing, and, having paid their fees and honoured them well, would have put the whole case before them.", "His scheme found favour with many, and yet at last was rejected, for others ran indoors and brought out their gods, too, to be honoured, till there was a herd of gods all seated there on the pavement; yet would they have honoured them and put their case before them but that a fat man ran up last of all, carefully holding under a reverent arm his own two hound faced gods, though he knew well  as, indeed, all men must  that they were notoriously at war with the little cat faced idols.", "And although the animosities natural to faith had all been lulled by the crisis, yet a look of anger had come into the cat like faces that no one dared disregard, and all perceived that if they stayed a moment longer there would be flaming around them the jealousy of the gods; so each man hastily took his idols home, leaving the fat man insisting that his hound faced gods should be honoured.", "Then there were schemes again and voices raised in debate, and many new dangers feared and new plans made.", "But in the end they made no defence against danger, for they knew not what it would be, but wrote upon parchment as a warning, and in order that all might know  \"_The bad old woman in black ran down the street of the ox butchers._\"      The Bird of the Difficult Eye  Observant men and women that know their Bond Street well will appreciate my astonishment when in a jewellers' shop I perceived that nobody was furtively watching me.", "Not only this but when I even picked up a little carved crystal to examine it no shop assistants crowded round me.", "I walked the whole length of the shop, still no one politely followed.", "Seeing from this that some extraordinary revolution had occurred in the jewelry business I went with my curiosity well aroused to a queer old person half demon and half man who has an idol shop in a byway of the City and who keeps me informed of affairs at the Edge of the World.", "And briefly over a pinch of heather incense that he takes by way of snuff he gave me this tremendous information  that Mr.", "Neepy Thang the son of Thangobrind had returned from the Edge of the World and was even now in London.", "The information may not appear tremendous to those unacquainted with the source of jewelry; but when I say that the only thief employed by any West end jeweller since famous Thangobrind's distressing doom is this same Neepy Thang, and that for lightness of fingers and swiftness of stockinged foot they have none better in Paris, it will be understood why the Bond Street jewellers no longer cared what became of their old stock.", "There were big diamonds in London that summer and a few considerable sapphires.", "In certain astounding kingdoms behind the East strange sovereigns missed from their turbans the heirlooms of ancient wars, and here and there the keepers of crown jewels who had not heard the stockinged feet of Thang, were questioned and died slowly.", "And the jewellers gave a little dinner to Thang at the Hotel Great Magnificent; the windows had not been opened for five years and there was wine at a guinea a bottle that you could not tell from champagne and cigars at half a crown with a Havana label.", "Altogether it was a splendid evening for Thang.", "But I have to tell of a far sadder thing than a dinner at a hotel.", "The public require jewelry and jewelry must be obtained.", "I have to tell of Neepy Thang's last journey.", "That year the fashion was emeralds.", "A man named Green had recently crossed the Channel on a bicycle and the jewellers said that a green stone would be particularly appropriate to commemorate the event and recommended emeralds.", "Now a certain money lender of Cheapside who had just been made a peer had divided his gains into three equal parts; one for the purchase of the peerage, country house and park, and the twenty thousand pheasants that are absolutely essential, and one for the upkeep of the position, while the third he banked abroad, partly to cheat the native tax gatherer and partly because it seemed to him that the days of the Peerage were few and that he might at any moment be called upon to start afresh elsewhere.", "In the upkeep of the position he included jewelry for his wife and so it came about that Lord Castlenorman placed an order with two well known Bond street jewellers named Messrs.", "Grosvenor and Campbell to the extent of £100,000 for a few reliable emeralds.", "But the emeralds in stock were mostly small and shop soiled and Neepy Thang had to set out at once before he had had as much as a week in London.", "I will briefly sketch his project.", "Not many knew it, for where the form of business is blackmail the fewer creditors you have the better (which of course in various degrees applies at all times).", "On the shores of the risky seas of Shiroora Shan grows one tree only so that upon its branches if anywhere in the world there must build its nest the Bird of the Difficult Eye.", "Neepy Thang had come by this information, which was indeed the truth, that if the bird migrated to Fairyland before the three eggs hatched out they would undoubtedly all turn into emeralds, while if they hatched out first it would be a bad business.", "When he had mentioned these eggs to Messrs.", "Grosvenor and Campbell they had said, \"The very thing\"  they were men of few words, in English, for it was not their native tongue.", "So Neepy Thang set out.", "He bought the purple ticket at Victoria Station.", "He went by Herne Hill, Bromley and Bickley and passed St.", "Mary Cray.", "At Eynsford he changed and taking a footpath along a winding valley went wandering into the hills.", "And at the top of a hill in a little wood, where all the anemones long since were over and the perfume of mint and thyme from outside came drifting in with Thang, he found once more the familiar path, age old and fair as wonder, that leads to the Edge of the World.", "Little to him were its sacred memories that are one with the secret of earth, for he was on business, and little would they be to me if I ever put them on paper.", "Let it suffice that he went down that path going further and further from the fields we know, and all the way he muttered to himself, \"What if the eggs hatch out and it be a bad business!\"", "The glamour that is at all times upon those lonely lands that lie at the back of the chalky hills of Kent intensified as he went upon his journeys.", "Queerer and queerer grew the things that he saw by little World End Path.", "Many a twilight descended upon that journey with all their mysteries, many a blaze of stars; many a morning came flaming up to a tinkle of silvern horns; till the outpost elves of Fairyland came in sight and the glittering crests of Fairyland's three mountains betokened the journey's end.", "And so with painful steps (for the shores of the world are covered with huge crystals) he came to the risky seas of Shiroora Shan and saw them pounding to gravel the wreckage of fallen stars, saw them and heard their roar, those shipless seas that between earth and the fairies' homes heave beneath some huge wind that is none of our four.", "And there in the darkness on the grizzly coast, for darkness was swooping slantwise down the sky as though with some evil purpose, there stood that lonely, gnarled and deciduous tree.", "It was a bad place to be found in after dark, and night descended with multitudes of stars, beasts prowling in the blackness gluttered [See any dictionary, but in vain.]", "at Neepy Thang.", "And there on a lower branch within easy reach he clearly saw the Bird of the Difficult Eye sitting upon the nest for which she is famous.", "Her face was towards those three inscrutable mountains, far off on the other side of the risky seas, whose hidden valleys are Fairyland.", "Though not yet autumn in the fields we know, it was close on midwinter here, the moment as Thang knew when those eggs hatch out.", "Had he miscalculated and arrived a minute too late?", "Yet the bird was even now about to migrate, her pinions fluttered and her gaze was toward Fairyland.", "Thang hoped and muttered a prayer to those pagan gods whose spite and vengeance he had most reason to fear.", "It seems that it was too late or a prayer too small to placate them, for there and then the stroke of midwinter came and the eggs hatched out in the roar of Shiroora Shan or ever the bird was gone with her difficult eye and it was a bad business indeed for Neepy Thang; I haven't the heart to tell you any more.", "\"'Ere,\" said Lord Castlenorman some few weeks later to Messrs.", "Grosvenor and Campbell, \"you aren't 'arf taking your time about those emeralds.\"", "The Long Porter's Tale  There are things that are known only to the long porter of Tong Tong Tarrup as he sits and mumbles memories to himself in the little bastion gateway.", "He remembers the war there was in the halls of the gnomes; and how the fairies came for the opals once, which Tong Tong Tarrup has; and the way that the giants went through the fields below, he watching from his gateway  he remembers quests that are even yet a wonder to the gods.", "Who dwells in those frozen houses on the high bare brink of the world not even he has told me, and he is held to be garrulous.", "Among the elves, the only living things ever seen moving at that awful altitude where they quarry turquoise on Earth's highest crag, his name is a byword for loquacity wherewith they mock the talkative.", "His favourite story if you offer him bash  the drug of which he is fondest, and for which he will give his service in war to the elves against the goblins, or vice versa if the goblins bring him more  his favourite story, when bodily soothed by the drug and mentally fiercely excited, tells of a quest undertaken ever so long ago for nothing more marketable than an old woman's song.", "Picture him telling it.", "An old man, lean and bearded, and almost monstrously long, that lolled in a city's gateway on a crag perhaps ten miles high; the houses for the most part facing eastward, lit by the sun and moon and the constellations we know, but one house on the pinnacle looking over the edge of the world and lit by the glimmer of those unearthly spaces where one long evening wears away the stars  my little offering of bash; a long forefinger that nipped it at once on a stained and greedy thumb  all these are in the foreground of the picture.", "In the background, the mystery of those silent houses and of not knowing who their denizens were, or what service they had at the hands of the long porter and what payment he had in return, and whether he was mortal.", "Picture him in the gateway of this incredible town, having swallowed my bash in silence, stretch his great length, lean back, and begin to speak.", "It seems that one clear morning a hundred years ago, a visitor to Tong Tong Tarrup was climbing up from the world.", "He had already passed above the snow and had set his foot on a step of the earthward stairway that goes down from Tong Tong Tarrup on to the rocks, when the long porter saw him.", "And so painfully did he climb those easy steps that the grizzled man on watch had long to wonder whether or not the stranger brought him bash, the drug that gives a meaning to the stars and seems to explain the twilight.", "And in the end there was not a scrap of bash, and the stranger had nothing better to offer that grizzled man than his mere story only.", "It seems that the stranger's name was Gerald Jones, and he always lived in London; but once as a child he had been on a Northern moor.", "It was so long ago that he did not remember how, only somehow or other he walked alone on the moor, and all the ling was in flower.", "There was nothing in sight but ling and heather and bracken, except, far off near the sunset, on indistinct hills, there were little vague patches that looked like the fields of men.", "With evening a mist crept up and hid the hills, and still he went walking on over the moor.", "And then he came to the valley, a tiny valley in the midst of the moor, whose sides were incredibly steep.", "He lay down and looked at it through the roots of the ling.", "And a long, long way below him, in a garden by a cottage, with hollyhocks all round her that were taller than herself, there sat an old woman on a wooden chair, singing in the evening.", "And the man had taken a fancy to the song and remembered it after in London, and whenever it came to his mind it made him think of evenings  the kind you don't get in London  and he heard a soft wind going idly over the moor and the bumble bees in a hurry, and forgot the noise of the traffic.", "And always, whenever he heard men speak of Time, he grudged to Time most this song.", "Once afterwards he went to that Northern moor again and found the tiny valley, but there was no old woman in the garden, and no one was singing a song.", "And either regret for the song that the old woman had sung, on a summer evening twenty years away and daily receding, troubled his mind, or else the wearisome work that he did in London, for he worked for a great firm that was perfectly useless; and he grew old early, as men do in cities.", "And at last, when melancholy brought only regret and the uselessness of his work gained round him with age, he decided to consult a magician.", "So to a magician he went and told him his troubles, and particularly he told him how he had heard the song.", "\"And now,\" he said, \"it is nowhere in the world.\"", "\"Of course it is not in the world,\" the magician said, \"but over the Edge of the World you may easily find it.\"", "And he told the man that he was suffering from flux of time and recommended a day at the Edge of the World.", "Jones asked what part of the Edge of the World he should go to, and the magician had heard Tong Tong Tarrup well spoken of; so he paid him, as is usual, in opals, and started at once on the journey.", "The ways to that town are winding; he took the ticket at Victoria Station that they only give if they know you  he went past Bleth  he went along the Hills of Neol Hungar and came to the Gap of Poy.", "All these are in that part of the world that pertains to the fields we know; but beyond the Gap of Poy on those ordinary plains, that so closely resemble Sussex, one first meets the unlikely.", "A line of common grey hills, the Hills of Sneg, may be seen at the edge of the plain from the Gap of Poy; it is there that the incredible begins, infrequently at first, but happening more and more as you go up the hills.", "For instance, descending once into Poy Plains, the first thing that I saw was an ordinary shepherd watching a flock of ordinary sheep.", "I looked at them for some time and nothing happened, when, without a word, one of the sheep walked up to the shepherd and borrowed his pipe and smoked it  an incident that struck me as unlikely; but in the Hills of Sneg I met an honest politician.", "Over these plains went Jones and over the Hills of Sneg, meeting at first unlikely things, and then incredible things, till he came to the long slope beyond the hills that leads up to the Edge of the World, and where, as all guidebooks tell, anything may happen.", "You might at the foot of this slope see here and there things that could conceivably occur in the fields we know; but soon these disappeared, and the traveller saw nothing but fabulous beasts, browsing on flowers as astounding as themselves, and rocks so distorted that their shapes had clearly a meaning, being too startling to be accidental.", "Even the trees were shockingly unfamiliar, they had so much to say, and they leant over to one another whenever they spoke and struck grotesque attitudes and leered.", "Jones saw two fir trees fighting.", "The effect of these scenes on his nerves was very severe; still he climbed on, and was much cheered at last by the sight of a primrose, the only familiar thing he had seen for hours, but it whistled and skipped away.", "He saw the unicorns in their secret valley.", "Then night in a sinister way slipped over the sky, and there shone not only the stars, but lesser and greater moons, and he heard dragons rattling in the dark.", "With dawn there appeared above him among its amazing crags the town of Tong Tong Tarrup, with the light on its frozen stairs, a tiny cluster of houses far up in the sky.", "He was on the steep mountain now  great mists were leaving it slowly, and revealing, as they trailed away, more and more astonishing things.", "Before the mist had all gone he heard quite near him, on what he had thought was bare mountain, the sound of a heavy galloping on turf.", "He had come to the plateau of the centaurs.", "And all at once he saw them in the mist  there they were, the children of fable, five enormous centaurs.", "Had he paused on account of any astonishment he had not come so far  he strode on over the plateau, and came quite near to the centaurs.", "It is never the centaurs' wont to notice men; they pawed the ground and shouted to one another in Greek, but they said no word to him.", "Nevertheless they turned and stared at him when he left them, and when he had crossed the plateau and still went on, all five of them cantered after to the edge of their green land; for above the high green plateau of the centaurs is nothing but naked mountains, and the last green thing that is seen by the mountaineer as he travels to Tong Tong Tarrup is the grass that the centaurs trample.", "He came into the snow fields that the mountain wears like a cape, its head being bare above it, and still climbed on.", "The centaurs watched him with increasing wonder.", "Not even fabulous beasts were near him now, nor strange demoniac trees  nothing but snow and the clean bare crag above it on which was Tong Tong Tarrup.", "All day he climbed and evening found him above the snow line; and soon he came to the stairway cut in the rock and in sight of that grizzled man, the long porter of Tong Tong Tarrup, sitting mumbling amazing memories to himself and expecting in vain from the stranger a gift of bash.", "It seems that as soon as the stranger arrived at the bastion gateway, tired though he was, he demanded lodgings at once that commanded a good view of the Edge of the World.", "But the long porter, that grizzled man, disappointed of his bash, demanded the stranger's story to add to his memories before he would show him the way.", "And this is the story, if the long porter has told me the truth and if his memory is still what it was.", "And when the story was told, the grizzled man arose, and, dangling his musical keys, went up through door after door and by many stairs and led the stranger to the top most house, the highest roof in the world, and in its parlour showed him the parlour window.", "There the tired stranger sat down in a chair and gazed out of the window sheer over the Edge of the World.", "The window was shut, and in its glittering panes the twilight of the World's Edge blazed and danced, partly like glow worms' lamps and partly like the sea; it went by rippling, full of wonderful moons.", "But the traveller did not look at the wonderful moons.", "For from the abyss there grew with their roots in far constellations a row of hollyhocks, and amongst them a small green garden quivered and trembled as scenes tremble in water; higher up, ling in bloom was floating upon the twilight, more and more floated up till all the twilight was purple; the little green garden low down was hung in the midst of it.", "And the garden down below, and the ling all round it, seemed all to be trembling and drifting on a song.", "For the twilight was full of a song that sang and rang along the edges of the World, and the green garden and the ling seemed to flicker and ripple with it as the song rose and fell, and an old woman was singing it down in the garden.", "A bumble bee sailed across from over the Edge of the World.", "And the song that was lapping there against the coasts of the World, and to which the stars were dancing, was the same that he had heard the old woman sing long since down in the valley in the midst of the Northern moor.", "But that grizzled man, the long porter, would not let the stranger stay, because he brought him no bash, and impatiently he shouldered him away, himself not troubling to glance through the World's outermost window, for the lands that Time afflicts and the spaces that Time knows not are all one to that grizzled man, and the bash that he eats more profoundly astounds his mind than anything man can show him either in the World we know or over the Edge.", "And, bitterly protesting, the traveller went back and down again to the World.", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "Accustomed as I am to the incredible from knowing the Edge of the World, the story presents difficulties to me.", "Yet it may be that the devastation wrought by Time is merely local, and that outside the scope of his destruction old songs are still being sung by those that we deem dead.", "I try to hope so.", "And yet the more I investigate the story that the long porter told me in the town of Tong Tong Tarrup the more plausible the alternative theory appears  that that grizzled man is a liar.", "The Loot of Loma  Coming back laden with the loot of Loma, the four tall men looked earnestly to the right; to the left they durst not, for the precipice there that had been with them so long went sickly down on to a bank of clouds, and how much further below that only their fears could say.", "Loma lay smoking, a city of ruin, behind them, all its defenders dead; there was no one left to pursue them, and yet their Indian instincts told them that all was scarcely well.", "They had gone three days along that narrow ledge  mountain quite smooth, incredible, above them, and precipice as smooth and as far below.", "It was chilly there in the mountains; at night a stream or a wind in the gloom of the chasm below them went like a whisper; the stillness of all things else began to wear the nerve  an enemy's howl would have braced them; they began to wish their perilous path were wider, they began to wish that they had not sacked Loma.", "Had that path been any wider the sacking of Loma must indeed have been harder for them, for the citizens must have fortified the city but that the awful narrowness of that ten league pass of the hills had made their crag surrounded city secure.", "And at last an Indian had said, \"Come, let us sack it.\"", "Grimly they laughed in the wigwams.", "Only the eagles, they said, had ever seen it, its hoard of emeralds and its golden gods; and one had said he would reach it, and they answered, \"Only the eagles.\"", "It was Laughing Face who said it, and who gathered thirty braves and led them into Loma with their tomahawks and their bows; there were only four left now, but they had the loot of Loma on a mule.", "They had four golden gods, a hundred emeralds, fifty two rubies, a large silver gong, two sticks of malachite with amethyst handles for holding incense at religious feasts, four beakers one foot high, each carved from a rose quartz crystal; a little coffer carved out of two diamonds, and (had they but known it) the written curse of a priest.", "It was written on parchment in an unknown tongue, and had been slipped in with the loot by a dying hand.", "From either end of that narrow, terrible ledge the third night was closing in; it was dropping down on them from the heights of the mountain and slipping up to them out of the abyss, the third night since Loma blazed and they had left it.", "Three more days of tramping should bring them in triumph home, and yet their instincts said that all was scarcely well.", "We who sit at home and draw the blinds and shut the shutters as soon as night appears, who gather round the fire when the wind is wild, who pray at regular seasons and in familiar shrines, know little of the demoniac look of night when it is filled with curses of false, infuriated gods.", "Such a night was this.", "Though in the heights the fleecy clouds were idle, yet the wind was stirring mournfully in the abyss and moaning as it stirred, unhappily at first and full of sorrow; but as day turned away from that awful path a very definite menace entered its voice which fast grew louder and louder, and night came on with a long howl.", "Shadows repeatedly passed over the stars, and then a mist fell swiftly, as though there were something suddenly to be done and utterly to be hidden, as in very truth there was.", "And in the chill of that mist the four tall men prayed to their totems, the whimsical wooden figures that stood so far away, watching the pleasant wigwams; the firelight even now would be dancing over their faces, while there would come to their ears delectable tales of war.", "They halted upon the pass and prayed, and waited for any sign.", "For a man's totem may be in the likeness perhaps of an otter, and a man may pray, and if his totem be placable and watching over his man a noise may be heard at once like the noise that the otter makes, though it be but a stone that falls on another stone; and the noise is a sign.", "The four men's totems that stood so far away were in the likeness of the coney, the bear, the heron, and the lizard.", "They waited, and no sign came.", "With all the noises of the wind in the abyss, no noise was like the thump that the coney makes, nor the bear's growl, nor the heron's screech, nor the rustle of the lizard in the reeds.", "It seemed that the wind was saying something over and over again, and that that thing was evil.", "They prayed again to their totems, and no sign came.", "And then they knew that there was some power that night that was prevailing against the pleasant carvings on painted poles of wood with the firelight on their faces so far away.", "Now it was clear that the wind was saying something, some very, very dreadful thing in a tongue that they did not know.", "They listened, but they could not tell what it said.", "Nobody could have said from seeing their faces how much the four tall men desired the wigwams again, desired the camp fire and the tales of war and the benignant totems that listened and smiled in the dusk  nobody could have seen how well they knew that this was no common night or wholesome mist.", "When at last no answer came nor any sign from their totems, they pulled out of the bag those golden gods that Loma gave not up except in flames and when all her men were dead.", "They had large ruby eyes and emerald tongues.", "They set them down upon that mountain pass, the cross legged idols with their emerald tongues; and having placed between them a few decent yards, as it seemed meet there should be between gods and men, they bowed them down and prayed in their desperate straits in that dank, ominous night to the gods they had wronged, for it seemed that there was a vengeance upon the hills and that they would scarce escape, as the wind knew well.", "And the gods laughed, all four, and wagged their emerald tongues; the Indians saw them, though the night had fallen and though the mist was low.", "The four tall men leaped up at once from their knees and would have left the gods upon the pass but that they feared some hunter of their tribe might one day find them and say of Laughing Face, \"He fled and left behind his golden gods,\" and sell the gold and come with his wealth to the wigwams and be greater than Laughing Face and his three men.", "And then they would have cast the gods away, down the abyss, with their eyes and their emerald tongues, but they knew that enough already they had wronged Loma's gods, and feared that vengeance enough was waiting them on the hills.", "So they packed them back in the bag on the frightened mule, the bag that held the curse they knew nothing of, and so pushed on into the menacing night.", "Till midnight they plodded on and would not sleep; grimmer and grimmer grew the look of the night, and the wind more full of meaning, and the mule knew and trembled, and it seemed that the wind knew, too, as did the instincts of those four tall men, though they could not reason it out, try how they would.", "And though the squaws waited long where the pass winds out of the mountains, near where the wigwams are upon the plains, the wigwams and the totems and the fire, and though they watched by day, and for many nights uttered familiar calls, still did they never see those four tall men emerge out of the mountains any more, even though they prayed to their totems upon their painted poles; but the curse in the mystical writing that they had unknown in their bag worked there on that lonely pass six leagues from the ruins of Loma, and nobody can tell us what it was.", "The Secret of the Sea  In an ill lit ancient tavern that I know, are many tales of the sea; but not without the wine of Gorgondy, that I had of a private bargain from the gnomes, was the tale laid bare for which I had waited of an evening for the greater part of a year.", "I knew my man and listened to his stories, sitting amid the bluster of his oaths; I plied him with rum and whiskey and mixed drinks, but there never came the tale for which I sought, and as a last resort I went to the Huthneth Mountains and bargained there all night with the chiefs of the gnomes.", "When I came to the ancient tavern and entered the low roofed room, bringing the hoard of the gnomes in a bottle of hammered iron, my man had not yet arrived.", "The sailors laughed at my old iron bottle, but I sat down and waited; had I opened it then they would have wept and sung.", "I was well content to wait, for I knew my man had the story, and it was such a one as had profoundly stirred the incredulity of the faithless.", "He entered and greeted me, and sat down and called for brandy.", "He was a hard man to turn from his purpose, and, uncorking my iron bottle, I sought to dissuade him from brandy for fear that when the brandy, bit his throat he should refuse to leave it for any other wine.", "He lifted his head and said deep and dreadful things of any man that should dare to speak against brandy.", "I swore that I said nothing against brandy but added that it was often given to children, while Gorgondy was only drunk by men of such depravity that they had abandoned sin because all the usual vices had come to seem genteel.", "When he asked if Gorgondy was a bad wine to drink I said that it was so bad that if a man sipped it that was the one touch that made damnation certain.", "Then he asked me what I had in the iron bottle, and I said it was Gorgondy; and then he shouted for the largest tumbler in that ill lit ancient tavern, and stood up and shook his fist at me when it came, and swore, and told me to fill it with the wine that I got on that bitter night from the treasure house of the gnomes.", "As he drank it he told me that he had met men who had spoken against wine, and that they had mentioned Heaven; and therefore he would not go there  no, not he; and that once he had sent one of them to Hell, but when he got there he would turn him out, and he had no use for milksops.", "Over the second tumbler he was thoughtful, but still he said no word of the tale he knew, until I feared that it would never be heard.", "But when the third glass of that terrific wine had burned its way down his gullet, and vindicated the wickedness of the gnomes, his reticence withered like a leaf in the fire, and he bellowed out the secret.", "I had long known that there is in ships a will or way of their own, and had even suspected that when sailors die or abandon their ships at sea, a derelict, being left to her own devices, may seek her own ends; but I had never dreamed by night, or fancied during the day, that the ships had a god that they worshipped, or that they secretly slipped away to a temple in the sea.", "Over the fourth glass of the wine that the gnomes so sinfully brew but have kept so wisely from man, until the bargain that I had with their elders all through that autumn night, the sailor told me the story.", "I do not tell it as he told it to me because of the oaths that were in it; nor is it from delicacy that I refrain from writing these oaths verbatim, but merely because the horror they caused in me at the time troubles me still whenever I put them on paper, and I continue to shudder until I have blotted them out.", "Therefore, I tell the story in my own words, which, if they possess a certain decency that was not in the mouth of that sailor, unfortunately do not smack, as his did, of rum and blood and the sea.", "You would take a ship to be a dead thing like a table, as dead as bits of iron and canvas and wood.", "That is because you always live on shore, and have never seen the sea, and drink milk.", "Milk is a more accursed drink than water.", "What with the captain and what with the man at the wheel, and what with the crew, a ship has no fair chance of showing a will of her own.", "There is only one moment in the history of ships, that carry crews on board, when they act by their own free will.", "This moment comes when all the crew are drunk.", "As the last man falls drunk on to the deck, the ship is free of man, and immediately slips away.", "She slips away at once on a new course and is never one yard out in a hundred miles.", "It was like this one night with the Sea Fancy.", "Bill Smiles was there himself, and can vouch for it.", "Bill Smiles has never told this tale before for fear that anyone should call him a liar.", "Nobody dislikes being hung as much as Bill Smiles would, but he won't be called a liar.", "I tell the tale as I heard it, relevancies and irrelevancies, though in my more decent words; and as I made no doubts of the truth of it then, I hardly like to now; others can please themselves.", "It is not often that the whole of a crew is drunk.", "The crew of the Sea Fancy was no drunkener than others.", "It happened like this.", "The captain was always drunk.", "One day a fancy he had that some spiders were plotting against him, or a sudden bleeding he had from both his ears, made him think that drinking might be bad for his health.", "Next day he signed the pledge.", "He was sober all that morning and all the afternoon, but at evening he saw a sailor drinking a a glass of beer, and a fit of madness seized him, and he said things that seemed bad to Bill Smiles.", "And next morning he made all of them take the pledge.", "For two days nobody had a drop to drink, unless you count water, and on the third morning the captain was quite drunk.", "It stood to reason they all had a glass or two then, except the man at the wheel; and towards evening the man at the wheel could bear it no longer, and seems to have had his glass like all the rest, for the ship's course wobbled a bit and made a circle or two.", "Then all of a sudden she went off south by east under full canvas till midnight, and never altered her course.", "And at midnight she came to the wide wet courts of the Temple in the Sea.", "People who think that Mr.", "Smiles is drunk often make a great mistake.", "And people are not the only ones that have made that mistake.", "Once a ship made it, and a lot of ships.", "It's a mistake to think that old Bill Smiles is drunk just because he can't move.", "Midnight and moonlight and the Temple in the Sea Bill Smiles clearly remembers, and all the derelicts in the world were there, the old abandoned ships.", "The figureheads were nodding to themselves and blinking at the image.", "The image was a woman of white marble on a pedestal in the outer court of the Temple of the Sea  she was clearly the love of all the man deserted ships, or the goddess to whom they prayed their heathen prayers.", "And as Bill Smiles was watching them, the lips of the figureheads moved; they all began to pray.", "But all at once their lips were closed with a snap when they saw that there were men on the Sea Fancy.", "They all came crowding up and nodded and nodded and nodded to see if all were drunk, and that's when they made their mistake about old Bill Smiles, although he couldn't move.", "They would have given up the treasuries of the gulfs sooner than let men hear the prayers they said or guess their love for the goddess.", "It is the intimate secret of the sea.", "The sailor paused.", "And, in my eagerness to hear what lyrical or blasphemous thing those figureheads prayed by moonlight at midnight in the sea to the woman of marble who was a goddess to ships, I pressed on the sailor more of my Gorgondy wine that the gnomes so wickedly brew.", "I should never have done it; but there he was sitting silent while the secret was almost mine.", "He took it moodily and drank a glass; and with the other glasses that he had had he fell a prey to the villainy of the gnomes who brew this unbridled wine to no good end.", "His body leaned forward slowly, then fell on to the table, his face being sideways and full of a wicked smile, and, saying very clearly the one word, \"Hell,\" he became silent for ever with the secret he had from the sea.", "How Ali Came to the Black Country  Shooshan the barber went to Shep the maker of teeth to discuss the state of England.", "They agreed that it was time to send for Ali.", "So Shooshan stepped late that night from the little shop near Fleet Street and made his way back again to his house in the ends of London and sent at once the message that brought Ali.", "And Ali came, mostly on foot, from the country of Persia, and it took him a year to come; but when he came he was welcome.", "And Shep told Ali what was the matter with England and Shooshan swore that it was so, and Ali looking out of the window of the little shop near Fleet Street beheld the ways of London and audibly blessed King Solomon and his seal.", "When Shep and Shooshan heard the names of King Solomon and his seal both asked, as they had scarcely dared before, if Ali had it.", "Ali patted a little bundle of silks that he drew from his inner raiment.", "It was there.", "Now concerning the movements and courses of the stars and the influence on them of spirits of Earth and devils this age has been rightly named by some The Second Age of Ignorance.", "But Ali knew.", "And by watching nightly, for seven nights in Bagdad, the way of certain stars he had found out the dwelling place of Him they Needed.", "Guided by Ali all three set forth for the Midlands.", "And by the reverence that was manifest in the faces of Shep and Shooshan towards the person of Ali, some knew what Ali carried, while others said that it was the tablets of the Law, others the name of God, and others that he must have a lot of money about him.", "So they passed Slod and Apton.", "And at last they came to the town for which Ali sought, that spot over which he had seen the shy stars wheel and swerve away from their orbits, being troubled.", "Verily when they came there were no stars, though it was midnight.", "And Ali said that it was the appointed place.", "In harems in Persia in the evening when the tales go round it is still told how Ali and Shep and Shooshan came to the Black country.", "When it was dawn they looked upon the country and saw how it was without doubt the appointed place, even as Ali had said, for the earth had been taken out of pits and burned and left lying in heaps, and there were many factories, and they stood over the town and as it were rejoiced.", "And with one voice Shep and Shooshan gave praise to Ali.", "And Ali said that the great ones of the place must needs be gathered together, and to this end Shep and Shooshan went into the town and there spoke craftily.", "For they said that Ali had of his wisdom contrived as it were a patent and a novelty which should greatly benefit England.", "And when they heard how he sought nothing for his novelty save only to benefit mankind they consented to speak with Ali and see his novelty.", "And they came forth and met Ali.", "And Ali spake and said unto them  \"O lords of this place; in the book that all men know it is written how that a fisherman casting his net into the sea drew up a bottle of brass, and when he took the stopper from the bottle a dreadful genie of horrible aspect rose from the bottle, as it were like a smoke, even to darkening the sky, whereat the fisherman...\" And the great ones of that place said  \"We have heard the story.\"", "And Ali said  \"What became of that genie after he was safely thrown back into the sea is not properly spoken of by any save those that pursue the study of demons and not with certainty by any man, but that the stopper that bore the ineffable seal and bears it to this day became separate from the bottle is among those things that man may know.\"", "And when there was doubt among the great ones Ali drew forth his bundle and one by one removed those many silks till the seal stood revealed; and some of them knew it for the seal and others knew it not.", "And they looked curiously at it and listened to Ali, and Ali said   \"Having heard how evil is the case of England, how a smoke has darkened the country, and in places (as men say) the grass is black, and how even yet your factories multiply, and haste and noise have become such that men have no time for song, I have therefore come at the bidding of my good friend Shooshan, barber of London, and of Shep, a maker of teeth, to make things well with you.\"", "And they said  \"But where is your patent and your novelty?\"", "And Ali said  \"Have I not here the stopper and on it, as good men know, the ineffable seal?", "Now I have learned in Persia how that your trains that make the haste, and hurry men to and fro, and your factories and the digging of your pits and all the things that are evil are everyone of them caused and brought about by steam.\"", "\"Is it not so?\"", "said Shooshan.", "\"It is even so,\" said Shep.", "\"Now it is clear,\" said Ali, \"that the chief devil that vexes England and has done all this harm, who herds men into cities and will not let them rest, is even the devil Steam.\"", "Then the great ones would have rebuked him but one said  \"No, let us hear him, perhaps his patent may improve on steam.\"", "And to them hearkening Ali went on thus  \"O Lords of this place, let there be made a bottle of strong steel, for I have no bottle with my stopper, and this being done let all the factories, trains, digging of pits, and all evil things soever that may be done by steam be stopped for seven days, and the men that tend them shall go free, but the steel bottle for my stopper I will leave open in a likely place.", "Now that chief devil, Steam, finding no factories to enter into, nor no trains, sirens nor pits prepared for him, and being curious and accustomed to steel pots, will verily enter one night into the bottle that you shall make for my stopper, and I shall spring forth from my hiding with my stopper and fasten him down with the ineffable seal which is the seal of King Solomon and deliver him up to you that you cast him into the sea.\"", "And the great ones answered Ali and they said  \"But what should we gain if we lose our prosperity and be no longer rich?\"", "And Ali said  \"When we have cast this devil into the sea there will come back again the woods and ferns and all the beautiful things that the world hath, the little leaping hares shall be seen at play, there shall be music on the hills again, and at twilight ease and quiet and after the twilight stars.\"", "And \"Verily,\" said Shooshan, \"there shall be the dance again.\"", "\"Aye,\" said Shep, \"there shall be the country dance.\"", "But the great ones spake and said, denying Ali  \"We will make no such bottle for your stopper nor stop our healthy factories or good trains, nor cease from our digging of pits nor do anything that you desire, for an interference with steam would strike at the roots of that prosperity that you see so plentifully all around us.\"", "Thus they dismissed Ali there and then from that place where the earth was torn up and burnt, being taken out of pits, and where factories blazed all night with a demoniac glare; and they dismissed with him both Shooshan, the barber, and Shep, the maker of teeth  so that a week later Ali started from Calais on his long walk back to Persia.", "And all this happened thirty years ago, and Shep is an old man now and Shooshan older, and many mouths have bit with the teeth of Shep (for he has a knack of getting them back whenever his customers die), and they have written again to Ali away in the country of Persia with these words, saying   \"O Ali.", "The devil has indeed begotten a devil, even that spirit Petrol.", "And the young devil waxeth, and increaseth in lustihood and is ten years old and becoming like to his father.", "Come therefore and help us with the ineffable seal.", "For there is none like Ali.\"", "And Ali turns where his slaves scatter rose leaves, letting the letter fall, and deeply draws from his hookah a puff of the scented smoke, right down into his lungs, and sighs it forth and smiles, and lolling round on to his other elbow speaks comfortably and says, \"And shall a man go twice to the help of a dog?\"", "And with these words he thinks no more of England but ponders again the inscrutable ways of God.", "The Bureau d'Echange de Maux  I often think of the Bureau d'Echange de Maux and the wondrously evil old man that sate therein.", "It stood in a little street that there is in Paris, its doorway made of three brown beams of wood, the top one overlapping the others like the Greek letter _pi_, all the rest painted green, a house far lower and narrower than its neighbours and infinitely stranger, a thing to take one's fancy.", "And over the doorway on the old brown beam in faded yellow letters this legend ran, Bureau Universel d'Echanges de Maux.", "I entered at once and accosted the listless man that lolled on a stool by his counter.", "I demanded the wherefore of his wonderful house, what evil wares he exchanged, with many other things that I wished to know, for curiosity led me; and indeed had it not I had gone at once from that shop, for there was so evil a look in that fattened man, in the hang of his fallen cheeks and his sinful eye, that you would have said he had had dealings with Hell and won the advantage by sheer wickedness.", "Such a man was mine host; but above all the evil of him lay in his eyes, which lay so still, so apathetic, that you would have sworn that he was drugged or dead; like lizards motionless on a wall they lay, then suddenly they darted, and all his cunning flamed up and revealed itself in what one moment before seemed no more than a sleepy and ordinary wicked old man.", "And this was the object and trade of that peculiar shop, the Bureau Universel d'Echange de Maux  you paid twenty francs, which the old man proceeded to take from me, for admission to the bureau and then had the right to exchange any evil or misfortune with anyone on the premises for some evil or misfortune that he \"could afford,\" as the old man put it.", "There were four or five men in the dingy ends of that low ceilinged room who gesticulated and muttered softly in twos as men who make a bargain, and now and then more came in, and the eyes of the flabby owner of the house leaped up at them as they entered, seemed to know their errands at once and each one's peculiar need, and fell back again into somnolence, receiving his twenty francs in an almost lifeless hand and biting the coin as though in pure absence of mind.", "\"Some of my clients,\" he told me.", "So amazing to me was the trade of this extraordinary shop that I engaged the old man in conversation, repulsive though he was, and from his garrulity I gathered these facts.", "He spoke in perfect English though his utterance was somewhat thick and heavy; no language seemed to come amiss to him.", "He had been in business a great many years, how many he would not say, and was far older than he looked.", "All kinds of people did business in his shop.", "What they exchanged with each other he did not care except that it had to be evils, he was not empowered to carry on any other kind of business.", "There was no evil, he told me, that was not negotiable there; no evil the old man knew had ever been taken away in despair from his shop.", "A man might have to wait and come back again next day, and next day and the day after, paying twenty francs each time, but the old man had the addresses of all his clients and shrewdly knew their needs, and soon the right two met and eagerly exchanged their commodities.", "\"Commodities\" was the old man's terrible word, said with a gruesome smack of his heavy lips, for he took a pride in his business and evils to him were goods.", "I learned from him in ten minutes very much of human nature, more than I have ever learned from any other man; I learned from him that a man's own evil is to him the worst thing there is or ever could be, and that an evil so unbalances all men's minds that they always seek for extremes in that small grim shop.", "A woman that had no children had exchanged with an impoverished half maddened creature with twelve.", "On one occasion a man had exchanged wisdom for folly.", "\"Why on earth did he do that?\"", "I said.", "\"None of my business,\" the old man answered in his heavy indolent way.", "He merely took his twenty francs from each and ratified the agreement in the little room at the back opening out of the shop where his clients do business.", "Apparently the man that had parted with wisdom had left the shop upon the tips of his toes with a happy though foolish expression all over his face, but the other went thoughtfully away wearing a troubled and very puzzled look.", "Almost always it seemed they did business in opposite evils.", "But the thing that puzzled me most in all my talks with that unwieldy man, the thing that puzzles me still, is that none that had once done business in that shop ever returned again; a man might come day after day for many weeks, but once do business and he never returned; so much the old man told me, but when I asked him why, he only muttered that he did not know.", "It was to discover the wherefore of this strange thing and for no other reason at all that I determined myself to do business sooner or later in the little room at the back of that mysterious shop.", "I determined to exchange some very trivial evil for some evil equally slight, to seek for myself an advantage so very small as scarcely to give Fate as it were a grip, for I deeply distrusted these bargains, knowing well that man has never yet benefited by the marvellous and that the more miraculous his advantage appears to be the more securely and tightly do the gods or the witches catch him.", "In a few days more I was going back to England and I was beginning to fear that I should be sea sick  this fear of sea sickness, not the actual malady but only the mere fear of it, I decided to exchange for a suitably little evil.", "I did not know with whom I should be dealing, who in reality was the head of the firm (one never does when shopping) but I decided that neither Jew nor Devil could make very much on so small a bargain as that.", "I told the old man my project, and he scoffed at the smallness of my commodity trying to urge me to some darker bargain, but could not move me from my purpose.", "And then he told me tales with a somewhat boastful air of the big business, the great bargains that had passed through his hands.", "A man had once run in there to try and exchange death, he had swallowed poison by accident and had only twelve hours to live.", "That sinister old man had been able to oblige him.", "A client was willing to exchange the commodity.", "\"But what did he give in exchange for death?\"", "I said.", "\"Life,\" said that grim old man with a furtive chuckle.", "\"It must have been a horrible life,\" I said.", "\"That was not my affair,\" the proprietor said, lazily rattling together as he spoke a little pocketful of twenty franc pieces.", "Strange business I watched in that shop for the next few days, the exchange of odd commodities, and heard strange mutterings in corners amongst couples who presently rose and went to the back room, the old man following to ratify.", "Twice a day for a week I paid my twenty francs, watching life with its great needs and its little needs morning and afternoon spread out before me in all its wonderful variety.", "And one day I met a comfortable man with only a little need, he seemed to have the very evil I wanted.", "He always feared the lift was going to break.", "I knew too much of hydraulics to fear things as silly as that, but it was not my business to cure his ridiculous fear.", "Very few words were needed to convince him that mine was the evil for him, he never crossed the sea, and I on the other hand could always walk upstairs, and I also felt at the time, as many must feel in that shop, that so absurd a fear could never trouble me.", "And yet at times it is almost the curse of my life.", "When we both had signed the parchment in the spidery back room and the old man had signed and ratified (for which we had to pay him fifty francs each) I went back to my hotel, and there I saw the deadly thing in the basement.", "They asked me if I would go upstairs in the lift, from force of habit I risked it, and I held my breath all the way and clenched my hands.", "Nothing will induce me to try such a journey again.", "I would sooner go up to my room in a balloon.", "And why?", "Because if a balloon goes wrong you have a chance, it may spread out into a parachute after it has burst, it may catch in a tree, a hundred and one things may happen, but if the lift falls down its shaft you are done.", "As for sea sickness I shall never be sick again, I cannot tell you why except that I know that it is so.", "And the shop in which I made this remarkable bargain, the shop to which none return when their business is done  I set out for it next day.", "Blindfold I could have found my way to the unfashionable quarter out of which a mean street runs, where you take the alley at the end, whence runs the cul de sac where the queer shop stood.", "A shop with pillars, fluted and painted red, stands on its near side, its other neighbour is a low class jeweller's with little silver brooches in the window.", "In such incongruous company stood the shop with beams with its walls painted green.", "In half an hour I found the cul de sac to which I had gone twice a day for the last week, I found the shop with the ugly painted pillars and the jeweller that sold brooches, but the green house with the three beams was gone.", "Pulled down, you will say, although in a single night.", "That can never be the answer to the mystery, for the house of the fluted pillars painted on plaster and the low class jeweller's shop with its silver brooches (all of which I could identify one by one) were standing side by side.", "A Story of Land and Sea  It is written in the first Book of Wonder how Captain Shard of the bad ship Desperate Lark, having looted the sea coast city Bombasharna, retired from active life; and resigning piracy to younger men, with the good will of the North and South Atlantic, settled down with a captured queen on his floating island.", "Sometimes he sank a ship for the sake of old times but he no longer hovered along the trade routes; and timid merchants watched for other men.", "It was not age that caused him to leave his romantic profession; nor unworthiness of its traditions, nor gun shot wound, nor drink; but grim necessity and force majeure.", "Five navies were after him.", "How he gave them the slip one day in the Mediterranean, how he fought with the Arabs, how a ship's broadside was heard in Lat.", "23 N. Long.", "4 E. for the first time and the last, with other things unknown to Admiralties, I shall proceed to tell.", "He had had his fling, had Shard, captain of pirates, and all his merry men wore pearls in their ear rings; and now the English fleet was after him under full sail along the coast of Spain with a good North wind behind them.", "They were not gaining much on Shard's rakish craft, the bad ship Desperate Lark, yet they were closer than was to his liking, and they interfered with business.", "For a day and a night they had chased him, when off Cape St.", "Vincent at about six a.m.", "Shard took that step that decided his retirement from active life, he turned for the Mediterranean.", "Had he held on Southwards down the African coast it is doubtful whether in face of the interference of England, Russia, France, Denmark and Spain, he could have made piracy pay; but in turning for the Mediterranean he took what we may call the penultimate step of his life which meant for him settling down.", "There were three great courses of action invented by Shard in his youth, upon which he pondered by day and brooded by night, consolations in all his dangers, secret even from his men, three means of escape as he hoped from any peril that might meet him on the sea.", "One of these was the floating island that the Book of Wonder tells of, another was so fantastic that we may doubt if even the brilliant audacity of Shard could ever have found it practicable, at least he never tried it so far as is known in that tavern by the sea in which I glean my news, and the third he determined on carrying out as he turned that morning for the Mediterranean.", "True he might yet have practised piracy in spite of the step that he took, a little later when the seas grew quiet, but that penultimate step was like that small house in the country that the business man has his eye on, like some snug investment put away for old age, there are certain final courses in men's lives which after taking they never go back to business.", "He turned then for the Mediterranean with the English fleet behind him, and his men wondered.", "What madness was this,  muttered Bill the Boatswain in Old Frank's only ear, with the French fleet waiting in the Gulf of Lyons and the Spaniards all the way between Sardinia and Tunis  for they knew the Spaniards' ways.", "And they made a deputation and waited upon Captain Shard, all of them sober and wearing their costly clothes, and they said that the Mediterranean was a trap, and all he said was that the North wind should hold.", "And the crew said they were done.", "So they entered the Mediterranean and the English fleet came up and closed the straits.", "And Shard went tacking along the Moroccan coast with a dozen frigates behind him.", "And the North wind grew in strength.", "And not till evening did he speak to his crew, and then he gathered them all together except the man at the helm, and politely asked them to come down to the hold.", "And there he showed them six immense steel axles and a dozen low iron wheels of enormous width which none had seen before; and he told his crew how all unknown to the world his keel had been specially fitted for these same axles and wheels, and how he meant soon to sail to the wide Atlantic again, though not by the way of the straits.", "And when they heard the name of the Atlantic all his merry men cheered, for they looked on the Atlantic as a wide safe sea.", "And night came down and Captain Shard sent for his diver.", "With the sea getting up it was hard work for the diver, but by midnight things were done to Shard's satisfaction, and the diver said that of all the jobs he had done  but finding no apt comparison, and being in need of a drink, silence fell on him and soon sleep, and his comrades carried him away to his hammock.", "All the next day the chase went on with the English well in sight, for Shard had lost time overnight with his wheels and axles, and the danger of meeting the Spaniards increased every hour; and evening came when every minute seemed dangerous, yet they still went tacking on towards the East where they knew the Spaniards must be.", "And at last they sighted their topsails right ahead, and still Shard went on.", "It was a close thing, but night was coming on, and the Union Jack which he hoisted helped Shard with the Spaniards for the last few anxious minutes, though it seemed to anger the English, but as Shard said, \"There's no pleasing everyone,\" and then the twilight shivered into darkness.", "\"Hard to starboard,\" said Captain Shard.", "The North wind which had risen all day was now blowing a gale.", "I do not know what part of the coast Shard steered for, but Shard knew, for the coasts of the world were to him what Margate is to some of us.", "At a place where the desert rolling up from mystery and from death, yea, from the heart of Africa, emerges upon the sea, no less grand than her, no less terrible, even there they sighted the land quite close, almost in darkness.", "Shard ordered every man to the hinder part of the ship and all the ballast too; and soon the Desperate Lark, her prow a little high out of the water, doing her eighteen knots before the wind, struck a sandy beach and shuddered, she heeled over a little, then righted herself, and slowly headed into the interior of Africa.", "The men would have given three cheers, but after the first Shard silenced them and, steering the ship himself, he made them a short speech while the broad wheels pounded slowly over the African sand, doing barely five knots in a gale.", "The perils of the sea he said had been greatly exaggerated.", "Ships had been sailing the sea for hundreds of years and at sea you knew what to do, but on land this was different.", "They were on land now and they were not to forget it.", "At sea you might make as much noise as you pleased and no harm was done, but on land anything might happen.", "One of the perils of the land that he instanced was that of hanging.", "For every hundred men that they hung on land, he said, not more than twenty would be hung at sea.", "The men were to sleep at their guns.", "They would not go far that night; for the risk of being wrecked at night was another danger peculiar to the land, while at sea you might sail from set of sun till dawn  yet it was essential to get out of sight of the sea for if anyone knew they were there they'd have cavalry after them.", "And he had sent back Smerdrak (a young lieutenant of pirates) to cover their tracks where they came up from the sea.", "And the merry men vigorously nodded their heads though they did not dare to cheer, and presently Smerdrak came running up and they threw him a rope by the stern.", "And when they had done fifteen knots they anchored, and Captain Shard gathered his men about him and, standing by the land wheel in the bows, under the large and clear Algerian stars, he explained his system of steering.", "There was not much to be said for it, he had with considerable ingenuity detached and pivoted the portion of the keel that held the leading axle and could move it by chains which were controlled from the land wheel, thus the front pair of wheels could be deflected at will, but only very slightly, and they afterwards found that in a hundred yards they could only turn their ship four yards from her course.", "But let not captains of comfortable battleships, or owners even of yachts, criticise too harshly a man who was not of their time and who knew not modern contrivances; it should be remembered also that Shard was no longer at sea.", "His steering may have been clumsy but he did what he could.", "When the use and limitations of his land wheel had been made clear to his men, Shard bade them all turn in except those on watch.", "Long before dawn he woke them and by the very first gleam of light they got their ship under way, so that when those two fleets that had made so sure of Shard closed in like a great crescent on the Algerian coast there was no sign to see of the Desperate Lark either on sea or land; and the flags of the Admiral's ship broke out into a hearty English oath.", "The gale blew for three days and, Shard using more sail by daylight, they scudded over the sands at little less than ten knots, though on the report of rough water ahead (as the lookout man called rocks, low hills or uneven surface before he adapted himself to his new surroundings) the rate was much decreased.", "Those were long summer days and Shard who was anxious while the wind held good to outpace the rumour of his own appearance sailed for nineteen hours a day, lying to at ten in the evening and hoisting sail again at three a.m.", "when it first began to be light.", "In those three days he did five hundred miles; then the wind dropped to a breeze though it still blew from the North, and for a week they did no more than two knots an hour.", "The merry men began to murmur then.", "Luck had distinctly favoured Shard at first for it sent him at ten knots through the only populous districts well ahead of crowds except those who chose to run, and the cavalry were away on a local raid.", "As for the runners they soon dropped off when Shard pointed his cannon though he did not dare to fire, up there near the coast; for much as he jeered at the intelligence of the English and Spanish Admirals in not suspecting his manoeuvre, the only one as he said that was possible in the circumstances, yet he knew that cannon had an obvious sound which would give his secret away to the weakest mind.", "Certainly luck had befriended him, and when it did so no longer he made out of the occasion all that could be made; for instance while the wind held good he had never missed opportunities to revictual, if he passed by a village its pigs and poultry were his, and whenever he passed by water he filled his tanks to the brim, and now that he could only do two knots he sailed all night with a man and a lantern before him  thus in that week he did close on four hundred miles while another man would have anchored at night and have missed five or six hours out of the twenty four.", "Yet his men murmured.", "Did he think the wind would last for ever, they said.", "And Shard only smoked.", "It was clear that he was thinking, and thinking hard.", "\"But what is he thinking about?\"", "said Bill to Bad Jack.", "And Bad Jack answered  \"He may think as hard as he likes but thinking won't get us out of the Sahara if this wind were to drop.\"", "And towards the end of that week Shard went to his chart room and laid a new course for his ship a little to the East and towards cultivation.", "And one day towards evening they sighted a village, and twilight came and the wind dropped altogether.", "Then the murmurs of the merry men grew to oaths and nearly to mutiny.", "\"Where were they now?\"", "they asked, and were they being treated like poor honest men?", "Shard quieted them by asking what they wished to do themselves and when no one had any better plan than going to the villagers and saying that they had been blown out of their course by a storm, Shard unfolded his scheme to them.", "Long ago he had heard how they drove carts with oxen in Africa, oxen were very numerous in these parts wherever there was any cultivation, and for this reason when the wind had begun to drop he had laid his course for the village  that night the moment it was dark they were to drive off fifty yoke of oxen; by midnight they must all be yoked to the bows and then away they would go at a good round gallop.", "So fine a plan as this astonished the men and they all apologised for their want of faith in Shard, shaking hands with him every one and spitting on their hands before they did so in token of good will.", "The raid that night succeeded admirably, but ingenious as Shard was on land, and a past master at sea, yet it must be admitted that lack of experience in this class of seamanship led him to make a mistake, a slight one it is true, and one that a little practice would have prevented altogether  the oxen could not gallop.", "Shard swore at them, threatened them with his pistol, said they should have no food, and all to no avail  that night and as long as they pulled the bad ship Desperate Lark they did one knot an hour and no more.", "Shard's failures like everything that came his way were used as stones in the edifice of his future success, he went at once to his chart room and worked out all his calculations anew.", "The matter of the oxen's pace made pursuit impossible to avoid.", "Shard therefore countermanded his order to his lieutenant to cover the tracks in the sand, and the Desperate Lark plodded on into the Sahara on her new course trusting to her guns.", "The village was not a large one and the little crowd that was sighted astern next morning disappeared after the first shot from the cannon in the stern.", "At first Shard made the oxen wear rough iron bits, another of his mistakes, and strong bits too.", "\"For if they run away,\" he had said, \"we might as well be driving before a gale and there's no saying where we'd find ourselves,\" but after a day or two he found that the bits were no good and, like the practical man he was, immediately corrected his mistake.", "And now the crew sang merry songs all day bringing out mandolins and clarionets and cheering Captain Shard.", "All were jolly except the captain himself whose face was moody and perplexed; he alone expected to hear more of those villagers; and the oxen were drinking up the water every day, he alone feared that there was no more to be had, and a very unpleasant fear that is when your ship is becalmed in a desert.", "For over a week they went on like this doing ten knots a day and the music and singing got on the captain's nerves, but he dared not tell his men what the trouble was.", "And then one day the oxen drank up the last of the water.", "And Lieutenant Smerdrak came and reported the fact.", "\"Give them rum,\" said Shard, and he cursed the oxen.", "\"What is good enough for me,\" he said, \"should be good enough for them,\" and he swore that they should have rum.", "\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said the young lieutenant of pirates.", "Shard should not be judged by the orders he gave that day, for nearly a fortnight he had watched the doom that was coming slowly towards him, discipline cut him off from anyone that might have shared his fear and discussed it, and all the while he had had to navigate his ship, which even at sea is an arduous responsibility.", "These things had fretted the calm of that clear judgment that had once baffled five navies.", "Therefore he cursed the oxen and ordered them rum, and Smerdrak had said \"Aye, aye, sir,\" and gone below.", "Towards sunset Shard was standing on the poop, thinking of death; it would not come to him by thirst; mutiny first, he thought.", "The oxen were refusing rum for the last time, and the men were beginning to eye Captain Shard in a very ominous way, not muttering, but each man looking at him with a sidelong look of the eye as though there were only one thought among them all that had no need of words.", "A score of geese like a long letter \"V\" were crossing the evening sky, they slanted their necks and all went twisting downwards somewhere about the horizon.", "Captain Shard rushed to his chart room, and presently the men came in at the door with Old Frank in front looking awkward and twisting his cap in his hand.", "\"What is it?\"", "said Shard as though nothing were wrong.", "Then Old Frank said what he had come to say  \"We want to know what you be going to do.\"", "And the men nodded grimly.", "\"Get water for the oxen,\" said Captain Shard, \"as the swine won't have rum, and they'll have to work for it, the lazy beasts.", "Up anchor!\"", "And at the word water a look came into their faces like when some wanderer suddenly thinks of home.", "\"Water!\"", "they said.", "\"Why not?\"", "said Captain Shard.", "And none of them ever knew that but for those geese, that slanted their necks and suddenly twisted downwards, they would have found no water that night nor ever after, and the Sahara would have taken them as she has taken so many and shall take so many more.", "All that night they followed their new course  at dawn they found an oasis and the oxen drank.", "And here, on this green acre or so with its palm trees and its well, beleaguered by thousands of miles of desert and holding out through the ages, here they decided to stay  for those who have been without water for a while in one of Africa's deserts come to have for that simple fluid such a regard as you, O reader, might not easily credit.", "And here each man chose a site where he would build his hut, and settle down, and marry perhaps, and even forget the sea; when Captain Shard having filled his tanks and barrels peremptorily ordered them to weigh anchor.", "There was much dissatisfaction, even some grumbling, but when a man has twice saved his fellows from death by the sheer freshness of his mind they come to have a respect for his judgment that is not shaken by trifles.", "It must be remembered that in the affair of the dropping of the wind and again when they ran out of water these men were at their wits' end  so was Shard on the last occasion, but that they did not know.", "All this Shard knew, and he chose this occasion to strengthen the reputation that he had in the minds of the men of that bad ship by explaining to them his motives, which usually he kept secret.", "The oasis he said must be a port of call for all the travellers within hundreds of miles  how many men did you see gathered together in any part of the world where there was a drop of whiskey to be had!", "And water here was rarer than whiskey in decent countries and, such was the peculiarity of the Arabs, even more precious.", "Another thing he pointed out to them, the Arabs were a singularly inquisitive people and if they came upon a ship in the desert they would probably talk about it; and the world having a wickedly malicious tongue would never construe in its proper light their difference with the English and Spanish fleets, but would merely side with the strong against the weak.", "And the men sighed, and sang the capstan song and hoisted the anchor and yoked the oxen up, and away they went doing their steady knot, which nothing could increase.", "It may be thought strange that with all sail furled in dead calm and while the oxen rested they should have cast anchor at all.", "But custom is not easily overcome and long survives its use.", "Rather enquire how many such useless customs we ourselves preserve  the flaps for instance to pull up the tops of hunting boots though the tops no longer pull up, the bows on our evening shoes that neither tie nor untie.", "They said they felt safer that way and there was an end of it.", "Shard lay a course of South by West and they did ten knots that day, the next day they did seven or eight and Shard hove to.", "Here he intended to stop, they had huge supplies of fodder on board for the oxen, for his men he had a pig or so, plenty of poultry, several sacks of biscuits and ninety eight oxen (for two were already eaten), and they were only twenty miles from water.", "Here he said they would stay till folks forgot their past, someone would invent something or some new thing would turn up to take folks' minds off them and the ships he had sunk  he forgot that there are men who are well paid to remember.", "Half way between him and the oasis he established a little depot where he buried his water barrels.", "As soon as a barrel was empty he sent half a dozen men to roll it by turns to the depot.", "This they would do at night, keeping hid by day, and next night they would push on to the oasis, fill the barrel and roll it back.", "Thus only ten miles away he soon had a store of water, unknown to the thirstiest native of Africa, from which he could safely replenish his tanks at will.", "He allowed his men to sing and even within reason to light fires.", "Those were jolly nights while the rum held out; sometimes they saw gazelles watching them curiously, sometimes a lion went by over the sand, the sound of his roar added to their sense of the security of their ship; all round them level, immense lay the Sahara  \"This is better than an English prison,\" said Captain Shard.", "And still the dead calm lasted, not even the sand whispered at night to little winds; and when the rum gave out and it looked like trouble, Shard reminded them what little use it had been to them when it was all they had and the oxen wouldn't look at it.", "And the days wore on with singing, and even dancing at times, and at nights round a cautious fire in a hollow of sand with only one man on watch they told tales of the sea.", "It was all a relief after arduous watches and sleeping by the guns, a rest to strained nerves and eyes; and all agreed, for all that they missed their rum, that the best place for a ship like theirs was the land.", "This was in Latitude 23 North, Longitude 4 East, where, as I have said, a ship's broadside was heard for the first time and the last.", "It happened this way.", "They had been there several weeks and had eaten perhaps ten or a dozen oxen and all that while there had been no breath of wind and they had seen no one  when one morning about two bells when the crew were at breakfast the lookout man reported cavalry on the port side.", "Shard who had already surrounded his ship with sharpened stakes ordered all his men on board, the young trumpeter who prided himself on having picked up the ways of the land, sounded \"Prepare to receive cavalry\".", "Shard sent a few men below with pikes to the lower port holes, two more aloft with muskets, the rest to the guns, he changed the \"grape\" or \"canister\" with which the guns were loaded in case of surprise, for shot, cleared the decks, drew in ladders, and before the cavalry came within range everything was ready for them.", "The oxen were always yoked in order that Shard could manoeuvre his ship at a moment's notice.", "When first sighted the cavalry were trotting but they were coming on now at a slow canter.", "Arabs in white robes on good horses.", "Shard estimated that there were two or three hundred of them.", "At sixty yards Shard opened with one gun, he had had the distance measured, but had never practised for fear of being heard at the oasis  the shot went high.", "The next one fell short and ricochetted over the Arabs' heads.", "Shard had the range then and by the time the ten remaining guns of his broadside were given the same elevation as that of his second gun the Arabs had come to the spot where the last shot pitched.", "The broadside hit the horses, mostly low, and ricochetted on amongst them; one cannon ball striking a rock at the horses' feet shattered it and sent fragments flying amongst the Arabs with the peculiar scream of things set free by projectiles from their motionless harmless state, and the cannon ball went on with them with a great howl, this shot alone killed three men.", "\"Very satisfactory,\" said Shard rubbing his chin.", "\"Load with grape,\" he added sharply.", "The broadside did not stop the Arabs nor even reduce their speed but they crowded in closer together as though for company in their time of danger, which they should not have done.", "They were four hundred yards off now, three hundred and fifty; and then the muskets began, for the two men in the crow's nest had thirty loaded muskets besides a few pistols, the muskets all stood round them leaning against the rail; they picked them up and fired them one by one.", "Every shot told, but still the Arabs came on.", "They were galloping now.", "It took some time to load the guns in those days.", "Three hundred yards, two hundred and fifty, men dropping all the way, two hundred yards; Old Frank for all his one ear had terrible eyes; it was pistols now, they had fired all their muskets; a hundred and fifty; Shard had marked the fifties with little white stones.", "Old Frank and Bad Jack up aloft felt pretty uneasy when they saw the Arabs had come to that little white stone, they both missed their shots.", "\"All ready?\"", "said Captain Shard.", "\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Smerdrak.", "\"Right,\" said Captain Shard raising a finger.", "A hundred and fifty yards is a bad range at which to be caught by grape (or \"case\" as we call it now), the gunners can hardly miss and the charge has time to spread.", "Shard estimated afterwards that he got thirty Arabs by that broadside alone and as many horses.", "There were close on two hundred of them still on their horses, yet the broadside of grape had unsettled them, they surged round the ship but seemed doubtful what to do.", "They carried swords and scimitars in their hands, though most had strange long muskets slung behind them, a few unslung them and began firing wildly.", "They could not reach Shard's merry men with their swords.", "Had it not been for that broadside that took them when it did they might have climbed up from their horses and carried the bad ship by sheer force of numbers, but they would have had to have been very steady, and the broadside spoiled all that.", "Their best course was to have concentrated all their efforts in setting fire to the ship but this they did not attempt.", "Part of them swarmed all round the ship brandishing their swords and looking vainly for an easy entrance; perhaps they expected a door, they were not sea faring people; but their leaders were evidently set on driving off the oxen not dreaming that the Desperate Lark had other means of travelling.", "And this to some extent they succeeded in doing.", "Thirty they drove off, cutting the traces, twenty they killed on the spot with their scimitars though the bow gun caught them twice as they did their work, and ten more were unluckily killed by Shard's bow gun.", "Before they could fire a third time from the bows they all galloped away, firing back at the oxen with their muskets and killing three more, and what troubled Shard more than the loss of his oxen was the way that they manoeuvred, galloping off just when the bow gun was ready and riding off by the port bow where the broadside could not get them, which seemed to him to show more knowledge of guns than they could have learned on that bright morning.", "What, thought Shard to himself, if they should bring big guns against the Desperate Lark!", "And the mere thought of it made him rail at Fate.", "But the merry men all cheered when they rode away.", "Shard had only twenty two oxen left, and then a score or so of the Arabs dismounted while the rest rode further on leading their horses.", "And the dismounted men lay down on the port bow behind some rocks two hundred yards away and began to shoot at the oxen.", "Shard had just enough of them left to manoeuvre his ship with an effort and he turned his ship a few points to the starboard so as to get a broadside at the rocks.", "But grape was of no use here as the only way he could get an Arab was by hitting one of the rocks with shot behind which an Arab was lying, and the rocks were not easy to hit except by chance, and as often as he manoeuvred his ship the Arabs changed their ground.", "This went on all day while the mounted Arabs hovered out of range watching what Shard would do; and all the while the oxen were growing fewer, so good a mark were they, until only ten were left, and the ship could manoeuvre no longer.", "But then they all rode off.", "The merry men were delighted, they calculated that one way and another they had unhorsed a hundred Arabs and on board there had been no more than one man wounded  Bad Jack had been hit in the wrist; probably by a bullet meant for the men at the guns, for the Arabs were firing high.", "They had captured a horse and had found quaint weapons on the bodies of the dead Arabs and an interesting kind of tobacco.", "It was evening now and they talked over the fight, made jokes about their luckier shots, smoked their new tobacco and sang; altogether it was the jolliest evening they'd had.", "But Shard alone on the quarter deck paced to and fro pondering, brooding and wondering.", "He had chopped off Bad Jack's wounded hand and given him a hook out of store, for captain does doctor upon these occasions and Shard, who was ready for most things, kept half a dozen or so of neat new limbs, and of course a chopper.", "Bad Jack had gone below swearing a little and said he'd lie down for a bit, the men were smoking and singing on the sand, and Shard was there alone.", "The thought that troubled Shard was  what would the Arabs do?", "They did not look like men to go away for nothing.", "And at back of all his thoughts was one that reiterated guns, guns, guns.", "He argued with himself that they could not drag them all that way on the sand, that the Desperate Lark was not worth it, that they had given it up.", "Yet he knew in his heart that that was what they would do.", "He knew there were fortified towns in Africa, and as for its being worth it, he knew that there was no pleasant thing left now to those defeated men except revenge, and if the Desperate Lark had come over the sand why not guns?", "He knew that the ship could never hold out against guns and cavalry, a week perhaps, two weeks, even three  what difference did it make how long it was, and the men sang       Away we go, Oho, Oho, Oho,     A drop of rum for you and me     And the world's as round as the letter O     And round it runs the sea.", "A melancholy settled down on Shard.", "About sunset Lieutenant Smerdrak came up for orders.", "Shard ordered a trench to be dug along the port side of the ship.", "The men wanted to sing and grumbled at having to dig, especially as Shard never mentioned his fear of guns, but he fingered his pistols and in the end Shard had his way.", "No one on board could shoot like Captain Shard.", "That is often the way with captains of pirate ships, it is a difficult position to hold.", "Discipline is essential to those that have the right to fly the skull and cross bones, and Shard was the man to enforce it.", "It was starlight by the time the trench was dug to the captain's satisfaction and the men that it was to protect when the worst came to the worst swore all the time as they dug.", "And when it was finished they clamoured to make a feast on some of the killed oxen, and this Shard let them do.", "And they lit a huge fire for the first time, burning abundant scrub, they thinking that Arabs daren't return, Shard knowing that concealment was now useless.", "All that night they feasted and sang, and Shard sat up in his chart room making his plans.", "When morning came they rigged up the cutter as they called the captured horse and told off her crew.", "As there were only two men that could ride at all these became the crew of the cutter.", "Spanish Dick and Bill the Boatswain were the two.", "Shard's orders were that turn and turn about they should take command of the cutter and cruise about five miles off to the North East all the day but at night they were to come in.", "And they fitted the horse up with a flagstaff in front of the saddle so that they could signal from her, and carried an anchor behind for fear she should run away.", "And as soon as Spanish Dick had ridden off Shard sent some men to roll all the barrels back from the depot where they were buried in the sand, with orders to watch the cutter all the time and, if she signalled, to return as fast as they could.", "They buried the Arabs that day, removing their water bottles and any provisions they had, and that night they got all the water barrels in, and for days nothing happened.", "One event of extraordinary importance did indeed occur, the wind got up one day, but it was due South, and as the oasis lay to the North of them and beyond that they might pick up the camel track Shard decided to stay where he was.", "If it had looked to him like lasting Shard might have hoisted sail but it it dropped at evening as he knew it would, and in any case it was not the wind he wanted.", "And more days went by, two weeks without a breeze.", "The dead oxen would not keep and they had had to kill three more, there were only seven left now.", "Never before had the men been so long without rum.", "And Captain Shard had doubled the watch besides making two more men sleep at the guns.", "They had tired of their simple games, and most of their songs, and their tales that were never true were no longer new.", "And then one day the monotony of the desert came down upon them.", "There is a fascination in the Sahara, a day there is delightful, a week is pleasant, a fortnight is a matter of opinion, but it was running into months.", "The men were perfectly polite but the boatswain wanted to know when Shard thought of moving on.", "It was an unreasonable question to ask of the captain of any ship in a dead calm in a desert, but Shard said he would set a course and let him know in a day or two.", "And a day or two went by over the monotony of the Sahara, who for monotony is unequalled by all the parts of the earth.", "Great marshes cannot equal it, nor plains of grass nor the sea, the Sahara alone lies unaltered by the seasons, she has no altering surface, no flowers to fade or grow, year in year out she is changeless for hundreds and hundreds of miles.", "And the boatswain came again and took off his cap and asked Captain Shard to be so kind as to tell them about his new course.", "Shard said he meant to stay until they had eaten three more of the oxen as they could only take three of them in the hold, there were only six left now.", "But what if there was no wind, the boatswain said.", "And at that moment the faintest breeze from the North ruffled the boatswain's forelock as he stood with his cap in his hand.", "\"Don't talk about the wind to _me_,\" said Captain Shard  and Bill was a little frightened for Shard's mother had been a gipsy.", "But it was only a breeze astray, a trick of the Sahara.", "And another week went by and they ate two more oxen.", "They obeyed Captain Shard ostentatiously now but they wore ominous looks.", "Bill came again and Shard answered him in Romany.", "Things were like this one hot Sahara morning when the cutter signalled.", "The lookout man told Shard and Shard read the message, \"Cavalry astern\" it read, and then a little later she signalled, \"With guns.\"", "\"Ah,\" said Captain Shard.", "One ray of hope Shard had; the flags on the cutter fluttered.", "For the first time for five weeks a light breeze blew from the North, very light, you hardly felt it.", "Spanish Dick rode in and anchored his horse to starboard and the cavalry came on slowly from the port.", "Not till the afternoon did they come in sight, and all the while that little breeze was blowing.", "\"One knot,\" said Shard at noon.", "\"Two knots,\" he said at six bells and still it grew and the Arabs trotted nearer.", "By five o'clock the merry men of the bad ship Desperate Lark could make out twelve long old fashioned guns on low wheeled carts dragged by horses and what looked like lighter guns carried on camels.", "The wind was blowing a little stronger now.", "\"Shall we hoist sail, sir?\"", "said Bill.", "\"Not yet,\" said Shard.", "By six o'clock the Arabs were just outside the range of cannon and there they halted.", "Then followed an anxious hour or so, but the Arabs came no nearer.", "They evidently meant to wait till dark to bring their guns up.", "Probably they intended to dig a gun epaulment from which they could safely pound away at the ship.", "\"We could do three knots,\" said Shard half to himself as he was walking up and down his quarter deck with very fast short paces.", "And then the sun set and they heard the Arabs praying and Shard's merry men cursed at the top of their voices to show that they were as good men as they.", "The Arabs had come no nearer, waiting for night.", "They did not know how Shard was longing for it too, he was gritting his teeth and sighing for it, he even would have prayed, but that he feared that it might remind Heaven of him and his merry men.", "Night came and the stars.", "\"Hoist sail,\" said Shard.", "The men sprang to their places, they had had enough of that silent lonely spot.", "They took the oxen on board and let the great sails down, and like a lover coming from over sea, long dreamed of, long expected, like a lost friend seen again after many years, the North wind came into the pirates' sails.", "And before Shard could stop it a ringing English cheer went away to the wondering Arabs.", "They started off at three knots and soon they might have done four but Shard would not risk it at night.", "All night the wind held good, and doing three knots from ten to four they were far out of sight of the Arabs when daylight came.", "And then Shard hoisted more sail and they did four knots and by eight bells they were doing four and a half.", "The spirits of those volatile men rose high, and discipline became perfect.", "So long as there was wind in the sails and water in the tanks Captain Shard felt safe at least from mutiny.", "Great men can only be overthrown while their fortunes are at their lowest.", "Having failed to depose Shard when his plans were open to criticism and he himself scarce knew what to do next it was hardly likely they could do it now; and whatever we think of his past and his way of living we cannot deny that Shard was among the great men of the world.", "Of defeat by the Arabs he did not feel so sure.", "It was useless to try to cover his tracks even if he had had time, the Arab cavalry could have picked them up anywhere.", "And he was afraid of their camels with those light guns on board, he had heard they could do seven knots and keep it up most of the day and if as much as one shot struck the mainmast... and Shard taking his mind off useless fears worked out on his chart when the Arabs were likely to overtake them.", "He told his men that the wind would hold good for a week, and, gipsy or no, he certainly knew as much about the wind as is good for a sailor to know.", "Alone in his chart room he worked it out like this, mark two hours to the good for surprise and finding the tracks and delay in starting, say three hours if the guns were mounted in their epaulments, then the Arabs should start at seven.", "Supposing the camels go twelve hours a day at seven knots they would do eighty four knots a day, while Shard doing three knots from ten to four, and four knots the rest of the time, was doing ninety and actually gaining.", "But when it came to it he wouldn't risk more than two knots at night while the enemy were out of sight, for he rightly regarded anything more than that as dangerous when sailing on land at night, so he too did eighty four knots a day.", "It was a pretty race.", "I have not troubled to see if Shard added up his figures wrongly or if he under rated the pace of camels, but whatever it was the Arabs gained slightly, for on the fourth day Spanish Jack, five knots astern on what they called the cutter, sighted the camels a very long way off and signalled the fact to Shard.", "They had left their cavalry behind as Shard supposed they would.", "The wind held good, they had still two oxen left and could always eat their \"cutter\", and they had a fair, though not ample, supply of water, but the appearance of the Arabs was a blow to Shard for it showed him that there was no getting away from them, and of all things he dreaded guns.", "He made light of it to the men  said they would sink the lot before they had been in action half an hour  yet he feared that once the guns came up it was only a question of time before his rigging was cut or his steering gear disabled.", "One point the Desperate Lark scored over the Arabs and a very good one too, darkness fell just before they could have sighted her and now Shard used the lantern ahead as he dared not do on the first night when the Arabs were close, and with the help of it managed to do three knots.", "The Arabs encamped in the evening and the Desperate Lark gained twenty knots.", "But the next evening they appeared again and this time they saw the sails of the Desperate Lark.", "On the sixth day they were close.", "On the seventh they were closer.", "And then, a line of verdure across their bows, Shard saw the Niger River.", "Whether he knew that for a thousand miles it rolled its course through forest, whether he even knew that it was there at all; what his plans were, or whether he lived from day to day like a man whose days are numbered he never told his men.", "Nor can I get an indication on this point from the talk that I hear from sailors in their cups in a certain tavern I know of.", "His face was expressionless, his mouth shut, and he held his ship to her course.", "That evening they were up to the edge of the tree trunks and the Arabs camped and waited ten knots astern and the wind had sunk a little.", "There Shard anchored a little before sunset and landed at once.", "At first he explored the forest a little on foot.", "Then he sent for Spanish Dick.", "They had slung the cutter on board some days ago when they found she could not keep up.", "Shard could not ride but he sent for Spanish Dick and told him he must take him as a passenger.", "So Spanish Dick slung him in front of the saddle \"before the mast\" as Shard called it, for they still carried a mast on the front of the saddle, and away they galloped together.", "\"Rough weather,\" said Shard, but he surveyed the forest as he went and the long and short of it was he found a place where the forest was less than half a mile thick and the Desperate Lark might get through  but twenty trees must be cut.", "Shard marked the trees himself, sent Spanish Dick right back to watch the Arabs and turned the whole of his crew on to those twenty trees.", "It was a frightful risk, the Desperate Lark was empty, with an enemy no more than ten knots astern, but it was a moment for bold measures and Shard took the chance of being left without his ship in the heart of Africa in the hope of being repaid by escaping altogether.", "The men worked all night on those twenty trees, those that had no axes bored with bradawls and blasted, and then relieved those that had.", "Shard was indefatigable, he went from tree to tree showing exactly what way every one was to fall, and what was to be done with them when they were down.", "Some had to be cut down because their branches would get in the way of the masts, others because their trunks would be in the way of the wheels; in the case of the last the stumps had to be made smooth and low with saws and perhaps a bit of the trunk sawn off and rolled away.", "This was the hardest work they had.", "And they were all large trees, on the other hand had they been small there would have been many more of them and they could not have sailed in and out, sometimes for hundreds of yards, without cutting any at all  and all this Shard calculated on doing if only there was time.", "The light before dawn came and it looked as if they would never do it at all.", "And then dawn came and it was all done but one tree, the hard part of the work had all been done in the night and a sort of final rush cleared everything up except that one huge tree.", "And then the cutter signalled the Arabs were moving.", "At dawn they had prayed, and now they had struck their camp.", "Shard at once ordered all his men to the ship except ten whom he left at the tree, they had some way to go and the Arabs had been moving some ten minutes before they got there.", "Shard took in the cutter which wasted five minutes, hoisted sail short handed and that took five minutes more, and slowly got under way.", "The wind was dropping still and by the time the Desperate Lark had come to the edge of that part of the forest through which Shard had laid his course the Arabs were no more than five knots away.", "He had sailed East half a mile, which he ought to have done overnight so as to be ready, but he could not spare time or thought or men away from those twenty trees.", "Then Shard turned into the forest and the Arabs were dead astern.", "They hurried when they saw the Desperate Lark enter the forest.", "\"Doing ten knots,\" said Shard as he watched them from the deck.", "The Desperate Lark was doing no more than a knot and a half for the wind was weak under the lee of the trees.", "Yet all went well for a while.", "The big tree had just come down some way ahead, and the ten men were sawing bits off the trunk.", "And then Shard saw a branch that he had not marked on the chart, it would just catch the top of the mainmast.", "He anchored at once and sent a hand aloft who sawed it half way through and did the rest with a pistol, and now the Arabs were only three knots astern.", "For a quarter of a mile Shard steered them through the forest till they came to the ten men and that bad big tree, another foot had yet to come off one corner of the stump for the wheels had to pass over it.", "Shard turned all hands on to the stump and it was then that the Arabs came within shot.", "But they had to unpack their gun.", "And before they had it mounted Shard was away.", "If they had charged things might have been different.", "When they saw the Desperate Lark under way again the Arabs came on to within three hundred yards and there they mounted two guns.", "Shard watched them along his stern gun but would not fire.", "They were six hundred yards away before the Arabs could fire and then they fired too soon and both guns missed.", "And Shard and his merry men saw clear water only ten fathoms ahead.", "Then Shard loaded his stern gun with canister instead of shot and at the same moment the Arabs charged on their camels; they came galloping down through the forest waving long lances.", "Shard left the steering to Smerdrak and stood by the stern gun, the Arabs were within fifty yards and still Shard did not fire; he had most of his men in the stern with muskets beside him.", "Those lances carried on camels were altogether different from swords in the hands of horsemen, they could reach the men on deck.", "The men could see the horrible barbs on the lanceheads, they were almost at their faces when Shard fired, and at the same moment the Desperate Lark with her dry and suncracked keel in air on the high bank of the Niger fell forward like a diver.", "The gun went off through the tree tops, a wave came over the bows and swept the stern, the Desperate Lark wriggled and righted herself, she was back in her element.", "The merry men looked at the wet decks and at their dripping clothes.", "\"Water,\" they said almost wonderingly.", "The Arabs followed a little way through the forest but when they saw that they had to face a broadside instead of one stern gun and perceived that a ship afloat is less vulnerable to cavalry even than when on shore, they abandoned ideas of revenge, and comforted themselves with a text out of their sacred book which tells how in other days and other places our enemies shall suffer even as we desire.", "For a thousand miles with the flow of the Niger and the help of occasional winds, the Desperate Lark moved seawards.", "At first he sweeps East a little and then Southwards, till you come to Akassa and the open sea.", "I will not tell you how they caught fish and ducks, raided a village here and there and at last came to Akassa, for I have said much already of Captain Shard.", "Imagine them drawing nearer and nearer the sea, bad men all, and yet with a feeling for something where we feel for our king, our country or our home, a feeling for something that burned in them not less ardently than our feelings in us, and that something the sea.", "Imagine them nearing it till sea birds appeared and they fancied they felt sea breezes and all sang songs again that they had not sung for weeks.", "Imagine them heaving at last on the salt Atlantic again.", "I have said much already of Captain Shard and I fear lest I shall weary you, O my reader, if I tell you any more of so bad a man.", "I too at the top of a tower all alone am weary.", "And yet it is right that such a tale should be told.", "A journey almost due South from near Algiers to Akassa in a ship that we should call no more than a yacht.", "Let it be a stimulus to younger men.", "Guarantee To The Reader  Since writing down for your benefit, O my reader, all this long tale that I heard in the tavern by the sea I have travelled in Algeria and Tunisia as well as in the Desert.", "Much that I saw in those countries seems to throw doubt on the tale that the sailor told me.", "To begin with the Desert does not come within hundreds of miles of the coast and there are more mountains to cross than you would suppose, the Atlas mountains in particular.", "It is just possible Shard might have got through by El Cantara, following the camel road which is many centuries old; or he may have gone by Algiers and Bou Saada and through the mountain pass El Finita Dem, though that is a bad enough way for camels to go (let alone bullocks with a ship) for which reason the Arabs call it Finita Dem  the Path of Blood.", "I should not have ventured to give this story the publicity of print had the sailor been sober when he told it, for fear that he I should have deceived you, O my reader; but this was never the case with him as I took good care to ensure  \"in vino veritas\" is a sound old proverb, and I never had cause to doubt his word unless that proverb lies.", "If it should prove that he has deceived me, let it pass; but if he has been the means of deceiving you there are little things about him that I know, the common gossip of that ancient tavern whose leaded bottle glass windows watch the sea, which I will tell at once to every judge of my acquaintance, and it will be a pretty race to see which of them will hang him.", "Meanwhile, O my reader, believe the story, resting assured that if you are taken in the thing shall be a matter for the hangman.", "A Tale of the Equator  He who is Sultan so remote to the East that his dominions were deemed fabulous in Babylon, whose name is a by word for distance today in the streets of Bagdad, whose capital bearded travellers invoke by name in the gate at evening to gather hearers to their tales when the smoke of tobacco arises, dice rattle and taverns shine; even he in that very city made mandate, and said  \"Let there be brought hither all my learned men that they may come before me and rejoice my heart with learning.\"", "Men ran and clarions sounded, and it was so that there came before the Sultan all of his learned men.", "And many were found wanting.", "But of those that were able to say acceptable things, ever after to be named The Fortunate, one said that to the South of the Earth lay a Land   said Land was crowned with lotus  where it was summer in our winter days and where it was winter in summer.", "And when the Sultan of those most distant lands knew that the Creator of All had contrived a device so vastly to his delight his merriment knew no bounds.", "On a sudden he spake and said, and this was the gist of his saying, that upon that line of boundary or limit that divided the North from the South a palace be made, where in the Northern courts should summer be, while in the South was winter; so should he move from court to court according to his mood, and dally with the summer in the morning and spend the noon with snow.", "So the Sultan's poets were sent for and bade to tell of that city, foreseeing its splendour far away to the South and in the future of time; and some were found fortunate.", "And of those that were found fortunate and were crowned with flowers none earned more easily the Sultan's smile (on which long days depended) than he that foreseeing the city spake of it thus   \"In seven years and seven days, O Prop of Heaven, shall thy builders build it, thy palace that is neither North nor South, where neither summer nor winter is sole lord of the hours.", "White I see it, very vast, as a city, very fair, as a woman, Earth's wonder, with many windows, with thy princesses peering out at twilight; yea, I behold the bliss of the gold balconies, and hear a rustling down long galleries and the doves' coo upon its sculptured eaves.", "O Prop of Heaven, would that so fair a city were built by thine ancient sires, the children of the sun, that so might all men see it even today, and not the poets only, whose vision sees it so far away to the South and in the future of time.", "\"O King of the Years, it shall stand midmost on that line that divideth equally the North from the South and that parteth the seasons asunder as with a screen.", "On the Northern side when summer is in the North thy silken guards shall pace by dazzling walls while thy spearsmen clad in furs go round the South.", "But at the hour of noon in the midmost day of the year thy chamberlain shall go down from his high place and into the midmost court, and men with trumpets shall go down behind him, and he shall utter a great cry at noon, and the men with trumpets shall cause their trumpets to blare, and the spearsmen clad in furs shall march to the North and thy silken guard shall take their place in the South, and summer shall leave the North and go to the South, and all the swallows shall rise and follow after.", "And alone in thine inner courts shall no change be, for they shall lie narrowly along that line that parteth the seasons in sunder and divideth the North from the South, and thy long gardens shall lie under them.", "\"And in thy gardens shall spring always be, for spring lies ever at the marge of summer; and autumn also shall always tint thy gardens, for autumn always flares at winter's edge, and those gardens shall lie apart between winter and summer.", "And there shall be orchards in thy garden, too, with all the burden of autumn on their boughs and all the blossom of spring.", "\"Yea, I behold this palace, for we see future things; I see its white wall shine in the huge glare of midsummer, and the lizards lying along it motionless in the sun, and men asleep in the noonday, and the butterflies floating by, and birds of radiant plumage chasing marvellous moths; far off the forest and great orchids glorying there, and iridescent insects dancing round in the light.", "I see the wall upon the other side; the snow has come upon the battlements, the icicles have fringed them like frozen beards, a wild wind blowing out of lonely places and crying to the cold fields as it blows has sent the snowdrifts higher than the buttresses; they that look out through windows on that side of thy palace see the wild geese flying low and all the birds of the winter, going by swift in packs beat low by the bitter wind, and the clouds above them are black, for it is midwinter there; while in thine other courts the fountains tinkle, falling on marble warmed by the fire of the summer sun.", "\"Such, O King of the Years, shall thy palace be, and its name shall be Erlathdronion, Earth's Wonder; and thy wisdom shall bid thine architects build at once, that all may see what as yet the poets see only, and that prophecy be fulfilled.\"", "And when the poet ceased the Sultan spake, and said, as all men hearkened with bent heads   \"It will be unnecessary for my builders to build this palace, Erlathdronion, Earth's Wonder, for in hearing thee we have drunk already its pleasures.\"", "And the poet went forth from the Presence and dreamed a new thing.", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "A Narrow Escape  It was underground.", "In that dank cavern down below Belgrave Square the walls were dripping.", "But what was that to the magician?", "It was secrecy that he needed, not dryness.", "There he pondered upon the trend of events, shaped destinies and concocted magical brews.", "For the last few years the serenity of his ponderings had been disturbed by the noise of the motor bus; while to his keen ears there came the earthquake rumble, far off, of the train in the tube, going down Sloane Street; and when he heard of the world above his head was not to its credit.", "He decided one evening over his evil pipe, down there in his dank chamber, that London had lived long enough, had abused its opportunities, had gone too far, in fine, with its civilisation.", "And so he decided to wreck it.", "Therefore he beckoned up his acolyte from the weedy end of the cavern, and, \"Bring me,\" he said, \"the heart of the toad that dwelleth in Arabia and by the mountains of Bethany.\"", "The acolyte slipped away by the hidden door, leaving that grim old man with his frightful pipe, and whither he went who knows but the gipsy people, or by what path he returned; but within a year he stood in the cavern again, slipping secretly in by the trap while the old man smoked, and he brought with him a little fleshy thing that rotted in a casket of pure gold.", "\"What is it?\"", "the old man croaked.", "\"It is,\" said the acolyte, \"the heart of the toad that dwelt once in Arabia and by the mountains of Bethany.\"", "The old man's crooked fingers closed on it, and he blessed the acolyte with his rasping voice and claw like hand uplifted; the motor bus rumbled above on its endless journey; far off the train shook Sloane Street.", "\"Come,\" said the old magician, \"it is time.\"", "And there and then they left the weedy cavern, the acolyte carrying cauldron, gold poker and all things needful, and went abroad in the light.", "And very wonderful the old man looked in his silks.", "Their goal was the outskirts of London; the old man strode in front and the acolyte ran behind him, and there was something magical in the old man's stride alone, without his wonderful dress, the cauldron and wand, the hurrying acolyte and the small gold poker.", "Little boys jeered till they caught the old man's eye.", "So there went on through London this strange procession of two, too swift for any to follow.", "Things seemed worse up there than they did in the cavern, and the further they got on their way towards London's outskirts the worse London got.", "\"It is time,\" said the old man, \"surely.\"", "And so they came at last to London's edge and a small hill watching it with a mournful look.", "It was so mean that the acolyte longed for the cavern, dank though it was and full of terrible sayings that the old man said when he slept.", "They climbed the hill and put the cauldron down, and put there in the necessary things, and lit a fire of herbs that no chemist will sell nor decent gardener grow, and stirred the cauldron with the golden poker.", "The magician retired a little apart and muttered, then he strode back to the cauldron and, all being ready, suddenly opened the casket and let the fleshy thing fall in to boil.", "Then he made spells, then he flung up his arms; the fumes from the cauldron entering in at his mind he said raging things that he had not known before and runes that were dreadful (the acolyte screamed); there he cursed London from fog to loam pit, from zenith to the abyss, motor bus, factory, shop, parliament, people.", "\"Let them all perish,\" he said, \"and London pass away, tram lines and bricks and pavement, the usurpers too long of the fields, let them all pass away and the wild hares come back, blackberry and briar rose.\"", "\"Let it pass,\" he said, \"pass now, pass utterly.\"", "In the momentary silence the old man coughed, then waited with eager eyes; and the long long hum of London hummed as it always has since first the reed huts were set up by the river, changing its note at times but always humming, louder now than it was in years gone by, but humming night and day though its voice be cracked with age; so it hummed on.", "And the old man turned him round to his trembling acolyte and terribly said as he sank into the earth  \"YOU HAVE NOT BROUGHT ME THE HEART OF THE TOAD THAT DWELLETH IN ARABIA NOR BY THE MOUNTAINS OF BETHANY!\"", "The Watch tower  I sat one April in Provence on a small hill above an ancient town that Goth and Vandal as yet have forborne to \"bring up to date.\"", "On the hill was an old worn castle with a watch tower, and a well with narrow steps and water in it still.", "The watch tower, staring South with neglected windows, faced a broad valley full of the pleasant twilight and the hum of evening things  it saw the fires of wanderers blink from the hills, beyond them the long forest black with pines, one star appearing, and darkness settling slowly down on Var.", "Sitting there listening to the green frogs croaking, hearing far voices clearly but all transmuted by evening, watching the windows in the little town glimmering one by one, and seeing the gloaming dwindle solemnly into night, a great many things fell from mind that seem important by day, and evening in their place planted strange fancies.", "Little winds had arisen and were whispering to and fro, it grew cold, and I was about to descend the hill, when I heard a voice behind me saying, \"Beware, beware.\"", "So much the voice appeared a part of the evening that I did not turn round at first; it was like voices that one hears in sleep and thinks to be of one's dream.", "And the word was monotonously repeated, in French.", "When I turned round I saw an old man with a horn.", "He had a white beard marvellously long, and still went on saying slowly, \"Beware, beware.\"", "He had clearly just come from the tower by which he stood, though I had heard no footfall.", "Had a man come stealthily upon me at such an hour and in so lonesome a place I had certainly felt surprised; but I saw almost at once that he was a spirit, and he seemed with his uncouth horn and his long white beard and that noiseless step of his to be so native to that time and place that I spoke to him as one does to some fellow traveller who asks you if you mind having the window up.", "I asked him what there was to beware of.", "\"Of what should a town beware,\" he said, \"but the Saracens?\"", "\"Saracens?\"", "I said.", "\"Yes, Saracens, Saracens,\" he answered and brandished his horn.", "\"And who are you?\"", "I said.", "\"I, I am the spirit of the tower,\" he said.", "When I asked him how he came by so human an aspect and was so unlike the material tower beside him he told me that the lives of all the watchers who had ever held the horn in the tower there had gone to make the spirit of the tower.", "\"It takes a hundred lives,\" he said.", "\"None hold the horn of late and men neglect the tower.", "When the walls are in ill repair the Saracens come  it was ever so.\"", "\"The Saracens don't come nowadays,\" I said.", "But he was gazing past me watching, and did not seem to heed me.", "\"They will run down those hills,\" he said, pointing away to the South, \"out of the woods about nightfall, and I shall blow my horn.", "The people will all come up from the town to the tower again; but the loopholes are in very ill repair.\"", "\"We never hear of the Saracens now,\" I said.", "\"Hear of the Saracens!\"", "the old spirit said.", "\"Hear of the Saracens!", "They slip one evening out of that forest, in the long white robes that they wear, and I blow my horn.", "That is the first that anyone ever hears of the Saracens.\"", "\"I mean,\" I said, \"that they never come at all.", "They cannot come and men fear other things.\"", "For I thought the old spirit might rest if he knew that the Saracens can never come again.", "But he said, \"There is nothing in the world to fear but the Saracens.", "Nothing else matters.", "How can men fear other things?\"", "Then I explained, so that he might have rest, and told him how all Europe, and in particular France, had terrible engines of war, both on land and sea; and how the Saracens had not these terrible engines either on sea or land, and so could by no means cross the Mediterranean or escape destruction on shore even though they should come there.", "I alluded to the European railways that could move armies night and day faster than horses could gallop.", "And when as well as I could I had explained all, he answered, \"In time all these things pass away and then there will still be the Saracens.\"", "And then I said, \"There has not been a Saracen either in France or Spain for over four hundred years.\"", "And he said, \"The Saracens!", "You do not know their cunning.", "That was ever the way of the Saracens.", "They do not come for a while, no not they, for a long while, and then one day they come.\"", "And peering southwards, but not seeing clearly because of the rising mist, he silently moved to his tower and up its broken steps.", "How Plash Goo Came to the Land of None's Desire  In a thatched cottage of enormous size, so vast that we might consider it a palace, but only a cottage in the style of its building, its timbers and the nature of its interior, there lived Plash Goo.", "Plash Goo was of the children of the giants, whose sire was Uph.", "And the lineage of Uph had dwindled in bulk for the last five hundred years, till the giants were now no more than fifteen foot high; but Uph ate elephants which he caught with his hands.", "Now on the tops of the mountains above the house of Plash Goo, for Plash Goo lived in the plains, there dwelt the dwarf whose name was Lrippity Kang.", "And the dwarf used to walk at evening on the edge of the tops of the mountains, and would walk up and down along it, and was squat and ugly and hairy, and was plainly seen of Plash Goo.", "And for many weeks the giant had suffered the sight of him, but at length grew irked at the sight (as men are by little things), and could not sleep of a night and lost his taste for pigs.", "And at last there came the day, as anyone might have known, when Plash Goo shouldered his club and went up to look for the dwarf.", "And the dwarf though briefly squat was broader than may be dreamed, beyond all breadth of man, and stronger than men may know; strength in its very essence dwelt in that little frame, as a spark in the heart of a flint  but to Plash Goo he was no more than mis shapen, bearded and squat, a thing that dared to defy all natural laws by being more broad than long.", "When Plash Goo came to the mountain he cast his chimahalk down (for so he named the club of his heart's desire) lest the dwarf should defy him with nimbleness; and stepped towards Lrippity Kang with gripping hands, who stopped in his mountainous walk without a word, and swung round his hideous breadth to confront Plash Goo.", "Already then Plash Goo in the deeps of his mind had seen himself seize the dwarf in one large hand and hurl him with his beard and his hated breadth sheer down the precipice that dropped away from that very place to the land of None's Desire.", "Yet it was otherwise that Fate would have it.", "For the dwarf parried with his little arms the grip of those monstrous hands, and gradually working along the enormous limbs came at length to the giant's body where by dwarfish cunning he obtained a grip; and turning Plash Goo about, as a spider does some great fly, till his little grip was suitable to his purpose, he suddenly lifted the giant over his head.", "Slowly at first, by the edge of that precipice whose base sheer distance hid, he swung his giant victim round his head, but soon faster and faster; and at last when Plash Goo was streaming round the hated breadth of the dwarf and the no less hated beard was flapping in the wind, Lrippity Kang let go.", "Plash Goo shot over the edge and for some way further, out towards Space, like a stone; then he began to fall.", "It was long before he believed and truly knew that this was really he that fell from this mountain, for we do not associate such dooms with ourselves; but when he had fallen for some while through the evening and saw below him, where there had been nothing to see, or began to see, the glimmer of tiny fields, then his optimism departed; till later on when the fields were greener and larger he saw that this was indeed (and growing now terribly nearer) that very land to which he had destined the dwarf.", "At last he saw it unmistakable, close, with its grim houses and its dreadful ways, and its green fields shining in the light of the evening.", "His cloak was streaming from him in whistling shreds.", "So Plash Goo came to the Land of None's Desire.", "The Three Sailors' Gambit  Sitting some years ago in the ancient tavern at Over, one afternoon in Spring, I was waiting, as was my custom, for something strange to happen.", "In this I was not always disappointed for the very curious leaded panes of that tavern, facing the sea, let a light into the low ceilinged room so mysterious, particularly at evening, that it somehow seemed to affect the events within.", "Be that as it may, I have seen strange things in that tavern and heard stranger things told.", "And as I sat there three sailors entered the tavern, just back, as they said, from sea, and come with sunburned skins from a very long voyage to the South; and one of them had a board and chessmen under his arm, and they were complaining that they could find no one who knew how to play chess.", "This was the year that the Tournament was in England.", "And a little dark man at a table in a corner of the room, drinking sugar and water, asked them why they wished to play chess; and they said they would play any man for a pound.", "They opened their box of chessmen then, a cheap and nasty set, and the man refused to play with such uncouth pieces, and the sailors suggested that perhaps he could find better ones; and in the end he went round to his lodgings near by and brought his own, and then they sat down to play for a pound a side.", "It was a consultation game on the part of the sailors, they said that all three must play.", "Well, the little dark man turned out to be Stavlokratz.", "Of course he was fabulously poor, and the sovereign meant more to him than it did to the sailors, but he didn't seem keen to play, it was the sailors that insisted; he had made the badness of the sailors' chessmen an excuse for not playing at all, but the sailors had overruled that, and then he told them straight out who he was, and the sailors had never heard of Stavlokratz.", "Well, no more was said after that.", "Stavlokratz said no more, either because he did not wish to boast or because he was huffed that they did not know who he was.", "And I saw no reason to enlighten the sailors about him; if he took their pound they had brought it upon themselves, and my boundless admiration for his genius made me feel that he deserved whatever might come his way.", "He had not asked to play, they had named the stakes, he had warned them, and gave them the first move; there was nothing unfair about Stavlokratz.", "I had never seen Stavlokratz before, but I had played over nearly every one of his games in the World Championship for the last three or four years; he was always of course the model chosen by students.", "Only young chess players can appreciate my delight at seeing him play first hand.", "Well, the sailors used to lower their heads almost as low as the table and mutter together before every move, but they muttered so low that you could not hear what they planned.", "They lost three pawns almost straight off, then a knight, and shortly after a bishop; they were playing in fact the famous Three Sailors' Gambit.", "Stavlokratz was playing with the easy confidence that they say was usual with him, when suddenly at about the thirteenth move I saw him look surprised; he leaned forward and looked at the board and then at the sailors, but he learned nothing from their vacant faces; he looked back at the board again.", "He moved more deliberately after that; the sailors lost two more pawns, Stavlokratz had lost nothing as yet.", "He looked at me I thought almost irritably, as though something would happen that he wished I was not there to see.", "I believed at first that he had qualms about taking the sailors' pound, until it dawned on me that he might lose the game; I saw that possibility in his face, not on the board, for the game had become almost incomprehensible to me.", "I cannot describe my astonishment.", "And a few moves later Stavlokratz resigned.", "The sailors showed no more elation than if they had won some game with greasy cards, playing amongst themselves.", "Stavlokratz asked them where they got their opening.", "\"We kind of thought of it,\" said one.", "\"It just come into our heads like,\" said another.", "He asked them questions about the ports they had touched at.", "He evidently thought as I did myself that they had learned their extraordinary gambit, perhaps in some old dependancy of Spain, from some young master of chess whose fame had not reached Europe.", "He was very eager to find out who this man could be, for neither of us imagined that those sailors had invented it, nor would anyone who had seen them.", "But he got no information from the sailors.", "Stavlokratz could very ill afford the loss of a pound.", "He offered to play them again for the same stakes.", "The sailors began to set up the white pieces.", "Stavlokratz pointed out that it was his turn for the first move.", "The sailors agreed but continued to set up the white pieces and sat with the white before them waiting for him to move.", "It was a trivial incident, but it revealed to Stavlokratz and myself that none of these sailors was aware that white always moves first.", "Stavlokratz played them on his own opening, reasoning of course that as they had never heard of Stavlokratz they would not know of his opening; and with probably a very good hope of getting back his pound he played the fifth variation with its tricky seventh move, at least so he intended, but it turned to a variation unknown to the students of Stavlokratz.", "Throughout this game I watched the sailors closely, and I became sure, as only an attentive watcher can be, that the one on their left, Jim Bunion, did not even know the moves.", "When I had made up my mind about this I watched only the other two, Adam Bailey and Bill Sloggs, trying to make out which was the master mind; and for a long while I could not.", "And then I heard Adam Bailey mutter six words, the only words I heard throughout the game, of all their consultations, \"No, him with the horse's head.\"", "And I decided that Adam Bailey did not know what a knight was, though of course he might have been explaining things to Bill Sloggs, but it did not sound like that; so that left Bill Sloggs.", "I watched Bill Sloggs after that with a certain wonder; he was no more intellectual than the others to look at, though rather more forceful perhaps.", "Poor old Stavlokratz was beaten again.", "Well, in the end I paid for Stavlokratz, and tried to get a game with Bill Sloggs alone, but this he would not agree to, it must be all three or none  and then I went back with Stavlokratz to his lodgings.", "He very kindly gave me a game  of course it did not last long but I am prouder of having been beaten by Stavlokratz than of any game that I have ever won.", "And then we talked for an hour about the sailors, and neither of us could make head or tail of them.", "I told him what I had noticed about Jim Bunion and Adam Bailey, and he agreed with me that Bill Sloggs was the man, though as to how he had come by that gambit or that variation of Stavlokratz's own opening he had no theory.", "I had the sailors' address which was that tavern as much as anywhere, and they were to be there all evening.", "As evening drew in I went back to the tavern, and found there still the three sailors.", "And I offered Bill Sloggs two pounds for a game with him alone and he refused, but in the end he played me for a drink.", "And then I found that he had not heard of the \"en passant\" rule, and believed that the fact of checking the king prevented him from castling, and did not know that a player can have two or more queens on the board at the same time if he queens his pawns, or that a pawn could ever become a knight; and he made as many of the stock mistakes as he had time for in a short game, which I won.", "I thought that I should have got at the secret then, but his mates who had sat scowling all the while in the corner came up and interfered.", "It was a breach of their compact apparently for one to play by himself, at any rate they seemed angry.", "So I left the tavern then and came back again next day, and the next day and the day after, and often saw the sailors, but none were in a communicative mood.", "I had got Stavlokratz to keep away, and they could get no one to play chess with at a pound a side, and I would not play with them unless they told me the secret.", "And then one evening I found Jim Bunion drunk, yet not so drunk as he wished, for the two pounds were spent; and I gave him very nearly a tumbler of whiskey, or what passed for whiskey in that tavern at Over, and he told me the secret at once.", "I had given the others some whiskey to keep them quiet, and later on in the evening they must have gone out, but Jim Bunion stayed with me by a little table leaning across it and talking low, right into my face, his breath smelling all the while of what passed for whiskey.", "The wind was blowing outside as it does on bad nights in November, coming up with moans from the South, towards which the tavern faced with all its leaded panes, so that none but I was able to hear his voice as Jim Bunion gave up his secret.", "They had sailed for years, he told me, with Bill Snyth; and on their last voyage home Bill Snyth had died.", "And he was buried at sea.", "Just the other side of the line they buried him, and his pals divided his kit, and these three got his crystal that only they knew he had, which Bill got one night in Cuba.", "They played chess with the crystal.", "And he was going on to tell me about that night in Cuba when Bill had bought the crystal from the stranger, how some folks might think they had seen thunderstorms, but let them go and listen to that one that thundered in Cuba when Bill was buying his crystal and they'd find that they didn't know what thunder was.", "But then I interrupted him, unfortunately perhaps, for it broke the thread of his tale and set him rambling a while, and cursing other people and talking of other lands, China, Port Said and Spain  but I brought him back to Cuba again in the end.", "I asked him how they could play chess with a crystal; and he said that you looked at the board and looked at the crystal, and there was the game in the crystal the same as it was on the board, with all the odd little pieces looking just the same though smaller, horses' heads and whatnots; and as soon as the other man moved the move came out in the crystal, and then your move appeared after it, and all you had to do was to make it on the board.", "If you didn't make the move that you saw in the crystal things got very bad in it, everything horribly mixed and moving about rapidly, and scowling and making the same move over and over again, and the crystal getting cloudier and cloudier; it was best to take one's eyes away from it then, or one dreamt about it afterwards, and the foul little pieces came and cursed you in your sleep and moved about all night with their crooked moves.", "I thought then that, drunk though he was, he was not telling the truth, and I promised to show him to people who played chess all their lives so that he and his mates could get a pound whenever they liked, and I promised not to reveal his secret even to Stavlokratz, if only he would tell me all the truth; and this promise I have kept till long after the three sailors have lost their secret.", "I told him straight out that I did not believe in the crystal.", "Well, Jim Bunion leaned forward then, even further across the table, and swore he had seen the man from whom Bill had bought the crystal and that he was one to whom anything was possible.", "To begin with his hair was villainously dark, and his features were unmistakable even down there in the South, and he could play chess with his eyes shut, and even then he could beat anyone in Cuba.", "But there was more than this, there was the bargain he made with Bill that told one who he was.", "He sold that crystal for Bill Snyth's soul.", "Jim Bunion leaning over the table with his breath in my face nodded his head several times and was silent.", "I began to question him then.", "Did they play chess as far away as Cuba?", "He said they all did.", "Was it conceivable that any man would make such a bargain as Snyth made?", "Wasn't the trick well known?", "Wasn't it in hundreds of books?", "And if he couldn't read books mustn't he have heard from sailors that it is the Devil's commonest dodge to get souls from silly people?", "Jim Bunion had leant back in his own chair quietly smiling at my questions but when I mentioned silly people he leaned forward again, and thrust his face close to mine and asked me several times if I called Bill Snyth silly.", "It seemed that these three sailors thought a great deal of Bill Snyth and it made Jim Bunion angry to hear anything said against him.", "I hastened to say that the bargain seemed silly though not of course the man who made it; for the sailor was almost threatening, and no wonder for the whiskey in that dim tavern would madden a nun.", "When I said that the bargain seemed silly he smiled again, and then he thundered his fist down on the table and said that no one had ever yet got the best of Bill Snyth and that that was the worst bargain for himself that the Devil ever made, and that from all he had read or heard of the Devil he had never been so badly had before as the night when he met Bill Snyth at the inn in the thunderstorm in Cuba, for Bill Snyth already had the damndest soul at sea; Bill was a good fellow, but his soul was damned right enough, so he got the crystal for nothing.", "Yes, he was there and saw it all himself, Bill Snyth in the Spanish inn and the candles flaring, and the Devil walking in and out of the rain, and then the bargain between those two old hands, and the Devil going out into the lightning, and the thunderstorm raging on, and Bill Snyth sitting chuckling to himself between the bursts of the thunder.", "But I had more questions to ask and interrupted this reminiscence.", "Why did they all three always play together?", "And a look of something like fear came over Jim Bunion's face; and at first he would not speak.", "And then he said to me that it was like this; they had not paid for that crystal, but got it as their share of Bill Snyth's kit.", "If they had paid for it or given something in exchange to Bill Snyth that would have been all right, but they couldn't do that now because Bill was dead, and they were not sure if the old bargain might not hold good.", "And Hell must be a large and lonely place, and to go there alone must be bad, and so the three agreed that they would all stick together, and use the crystal all three or not at all, unless one died, and then the two would use it and the one that was gone would wait for them.", "And the last of the three to go would take the crystal with him, or maybe the crystal would bring him.", "They didn't think, they said, they were the kind of men for Heaven, and he hoped they knew their place better than that, but they didn't fancy the notion of Hell alone, if Hell it had to be.", "It was all right for Bill Snyth, he was afraid of nothing.", "He had known perhaps five men that were not afraid of death, but Bill Snyth was not afraid of Hell.", "He died with a smile on his face like a child in its sleep; it was drink killed poor Bill Snyth.", "This was why I had beaten Bill Sloggs; Sloggs had the crystal on him while we played, but would not use it; these sailors seemed to fear loneliness as some people fear being hurt; he was the only one of the three who could play chess at all, he had learnt it in order to be able to answer questions and keep up their pretence, but he had learnt it badly, as I found.", "I never saw the crystal, they never showed it to anyone; but Jim Bunion told me that night that it was about the size that the thick end of a hen's egg would be if it were round.", "And then he fell asleep.", "There were many more questions that I would have asked him but I could not wake him up.", "I even pulled the table away so that he fell to the floor, but he slept on, and all the tavern was dark but for one candle burning; and it was then that I noticed for the first time that the other two sailors had gone, no one remained at all but Jim Bunion and I and the sinister barman of that curious inn, and he too was asleep.", "When I saw that it was impossible to wake the sailor I went out into the night.", "Next day Jim Bunion would talk of it no more; and when I went back to Stavlokratz I found him already putting on paper his theory about the sailors, which became accepted by chess players, that one of them had been taught their curious gambit and that the other two between them had learnt all the defensive openings as well as general play.", "Though who taught them no one could say, in spite of enquiries made afterwards all along the Southern Pacific.", "I never learnt any more details from any of the three sailors, they were always too drunk to speak or else not drunk enough to be communicative.", "I seem just to have taken Jim Bunion at the flood.", "But I kept my promise, it was I that introduced them to the Tournament, and a pretty mess they made of established reputations.", "And so they kept on for months, never losing a game and always playing for their pound a side.", "I used to follow them wherever they went merely to watch their play.", "They were more marvellous than Stavlokratz even in his youth.", "But then they took to liberties such as giving their queen when playing first class players.", "And in the end one day when all three were drunk they played the best player in England with only a row of pawns.", "They won the game all right.", "But the ball broke to pieces.", "I never smelt such a stench in all my life.", "The three sailors took it stoically enough, they signed on to different ships and went back again to the sea, and the world of chess lost sight, for ever I trust, of the most remarkable players it ever knew, who would have altogether spoiled the game.", "The Exiles Club  It was an evening party; and something someone had said to me had started me talking about a subject that to me is full of fascination, the subject of old religions, forsaken gods.", "The truth (for all religions have some of it), the wisdom, the beauty, of the religions of countries to which I travel have not the same appeal for me; for one only notices in them their tyranny and intolerance and the abject servitude that they claim from thought; but when a dynasty has been dethroned in heaven and goes forgotten and outcast even among men, one's eyes no longer dazzled by its power find something very wistful in the faces of fallen gods suppliant to be remembered, something almost tearfully beautiful, like a long warm summer twilight fading gently away after some day memorable in the story of earthly wars.", "Between what Zeus, for instance, has been once and the half remembered tale he is today there lies a space so great that there is no change of fortune known to man whereby we may measure the height down which he has fallen.", "And it is the same with many another god at whom once the ages trembled and the twentieth century treats as an old wives' tale.", "The fortitude that such a fall demands is surely more than human.", "Some such things as these I was saying, and being upon a subject that much attracts me I possibly spoke too loudly, certainly I was not aware that standing close behind me was no less a person than the ex King of Eritivaria, the thirty islands of the East, or I would have moderated my voice and moved away a little to give him more room.", "I was not aware of his presence until his satellite, one who had fallen with him into exile but still revolved about him, told me that his master desired to know me; and so to my surprise I was presented though neither of them even knew my name.", "And that was how I came to be invited by the ex King to dine at his club.", "At the time I could only account for his wishing to know me by supposing that he found in his own exiled condition some likeness to the fallen fortunes of the gods of whom I talked unwitting of his presence; but now I know that it was not of himself he was thinking when he asked me to dine at that club.", "The club would have been the most imposing building in any street in London, but in that obscure mean quarter of London in which they had built it it appeared unduly enormous.", "Lifting right up above those grotesque houses and built in that Greek style that we call Georgian, there was something Olympian about it.", "To my host an unfashionable street could have meant nothing, through all his youth wherever he had gone had become fashionable the moment he went there; words like the East End could have had no meaning to him.", "Whoever built that house had enormous wealth and cared nothing for fashion, perhaps despised it.", "As I stood gazing at the magnificent upper windows draped with great curtains, indistinct in the evening, on which huge shadows flickered my host attracted my attention from the doorway, and so I went in and met for the second time the ex King of Eritivaria.", "In front of us a stairway of rare marble led upwards, he took me through a side door and downstairs and we came to a banqueting hall of great magnificence.", "A long table ran up the middle of it, laid for quite twenty people, and I noticed the peculiarity that instead of chairs there were thrones for everyone except me, who was the only guest and for whom there was an ordinary chair.", "My host explained to me when we all sat down that everyone who belonged to that club was by rights a king.", "In fact none was permitted, he told me, to belong to the club until his claim to a kingdom made out in writing had been examined and allowed by those whose duty it was.", "The whim of a populace or the candidate's own misrule were never considered by the investigators, nothing counted with them but heredity and lawful descent from kings, all else was ignored.", "At that table there were those who had once reigned themselves, others lawfully claimed descent from kings that the world had forgotten, the kingdoms claimed by some had even changed their names.", "Hatzgurh, the mountain kingdom, is almost regarded as mythical.", "I have seldom seen greater splendour than that long hall provided below the level of the street.", "No doubt by day it was a little sombre, as all basements are, but at night with its great crystal chandeliers, and the glitter of heirlooms that had gone into exile, it surpassed the splendour of palaces that have only one king.", "They had come to London suddenly most of those kings, or their fathers before them, or forefathers; some had come away from their kingdoms by night, in a light sleigh, flogging the horses, or had galloped clear with morning over the border, some had trudged roads for days from their capital in disguise, yet many had had time just as they left to snatch up some small thing without price in markets, for the sake of old times as they said, but quite as much, I thought, with an eye to the future.", "And there these treasures glittered on that long table in the banqueting hall of the basement of that strange club.", "Merely to see them was much, but to hear their story that their owners told was to go back in fancy to epic times on the romantic border of fable and fact, where the heroes of history fought with the gods of myth.", "The famous silver horses of Gilgianza were there climbing their sheer mountain, which they did by miraculous means before the time of the Goths.", "It was not a large piece of silver but its workmanship outrivalled the skill of the bees.", "A yellow Emperor had brought out of the East a piece of that incomparable porcelain that had made his dynasty famous though all their deeds are forgotten, it had the exact shade of the right purple.", "And there was a little golden statuette of a dragon stealing a diamond from a lady, the dragon had the diamond in his claws, large and of the first water.", "There had been a kingdom whose whole constitution and history were founded on the legend, from which alone its kings had claimed their right to the scepter, that a dragon stole a diamond from a lady.", "When its last king left that country, because his favorite general used a peculiar formation under the fire of artillery, he brought with him the little ancient image that no longer proved him a king outside that singular club.", "There was the pair of amethyst cups of the turbaned King of Foo, the one that he drank from himself, and the one that he gave to his enemies, eye could not tell which was which.", "All these things the ex King of Eritivaria showed me, telling me a marvelous tale of each; of his own he had brought nothing, except the mascot that used once to sit on the top of the water tube of his favorite motor.", "I have not outlined a tenth of the splendour of that table, I had meant to come again and examine each piece of plate and make notes of its history; had I known that this was the last time I should wish to enter that club I should have looked at its treasures more attentively, but now as the wine went round and the exiles began to talk I took my eyes from the table and listened to strange tales of their former state.", "He that has seen better times has usually a poor tale to tell, some mean and trivial thing has been his undoing, but they that dined in that basement had mostly fallen like oaks on nights of abnormal tempest, had fallen mightily and shaken a nation.", "Those who had not been kings themselves, but claimed through an exiled ancestor, had stories to tell of even grander disaster, history seeming to have mellowed their dynasty's fate as moss grows over an oak a great while fallen.", "There were no jealousies there as so often there are among kings, rivalry must have ceased with the loss of their navies and armies, and they showed no bitterness against those that had turned them out, one speaking of the error of his Prime Minister by which he had lost his throne as \"poor old Friedrich's Heaven sent gift of tactlessness.\"", "They gossiped pleasantly of many things, the tittle tattle we all had to know when we were learning history, and many a wonderful story I might have heard, many a side light on mysterious wars had I not made use of one unfortunate word.", "That word was \"upstairs.\"", "The ex King of Eritivaria having pointed out to me those unparalleled heirlooms to which I have alluded, and many more besides, hospitably asked me if there was anything else that I would care to see, he meant the pieces of plate that they had in the cupboards, the curiously graven swords of other princes, historic jewels, legendary seals, but I who had had a glimpse of their marvelous staircase, whose balustrade I believed to be solid gold and wondering why in such a stately house they chose to dine in the basement, mentioned the word \"upstairs.\"", "A profound hush came down on the whole assembly, the hush that might greet levity in a cathedral.", "\"Upstairs!\"", "he gasped.", "\"We cannot go upstairs.\"", "I perceived that what I had said was an ill chosen thing.", "I tried to excuse myself but knew not how.", "\"Of course,\" I muttered, \"members may not take guests upstairs.\"", "\"Members!\"", "he said to me.", "\"We are not the members!\"", "There was such reproof in his voice that I said no more, I looked at him questioningly, perhaps my lips moved, I may have said \"What are you?\"", "A great surprise had come on me at their attitude.", "\"We are the waiters,\" he said.", "That I could not have known, here at last was honest ignorance that I had no need to be ashamed of, the very opulence of their table denied it.", "\"Then who are the members?\"", "I asked.", "Such a hush fell at that question, such a hush of genuine awe, that all of a sudden a wild thought entered my head, a thought strange and fantastic and terrible.", "I gripped my host by the wrist and hushed my voice.", "\"Are they too exiles?\"", "I asked.", "Twice as he looked in my face he gravely nodded his head.", "I left that club very swiftly indeed, never to see it again, scarcely pausing to say farewell to those menial kings, and as I left the door a great window opened far up at the top of the house and a flash of lightning streamed from it and killed a dog.", "The Three Infernal Jokes  This is the story that the desolate man told to me on the lonely Highland road one autumn evening with winter coming on and the stags roaring.", "The saddening twilight, the mountain already black, the dreadful melancholy of the stags' voices, his friendless mournful face, all seemed to be of some most sorrowful play staged in that valley by an outcast god, a lonely play of which the hills were part and he the only actor.", "For long we watched each other drawing out of the solitudes of those forsaken spaces.", "Then when we met he spoke.", "\"I will tell you a thing that will make you die of laughter.", "I will keep it to myself no longer.", "But first I must tell you how I came by it.\"", "I do not give the story in his words with all his woeful interjections and the misery of his frantic self reproaches for I would not convey unnecessarily to my readers that atmosphere of sadness that was about all he said and that seemed to go with him where ever he moved.", "It seems that he had been a member of a club, a West end club he called it, a respectable but quite inferior affair, probably in the City  agents belonged to it, fire insurance mostly, but life insurance and motor agents too, it was in fact a touts' club.", "It seems that a few of them one evening, forgetting for a moment their encyclopedias and non stop tyres, were talking loudly over a card table when the game had ended about their personal virtues, and a very little man with waxed moustaches who disliked the taste of wine was boasting heartily of his temperance.", "It was then that he who told this mournful story, drawn on by the boasts of others, leaned forward a little over the green baize into the light of the two guttering candles and revealed, no doubt a little shyly, his own extraordinary virtue.", "One woman was to him as ugly as another.", "And the silenced boasters rose and went home to bed leaving him all alone, as he supposed, with his unequalled virtue.", "And yet he was not alone, for when the rest had gone there arose a member out of a deep arm chair at the dark end of the room and walked across to him, a man whose occupation he did not know and only now suspects.", "\"You have,\" said the stranger, \"a surpassing virtue.\"", "\"I have no possible use for it,\" my poor friend replied.", "\"Then doubtless you would sell it cheap,\" said the stranger.", "Something in the man's manner or appearance made the desolate teller of this mournful tale feel his own inferiority, which probably made him feel acutely shy, so that his mind abased itself as an Oriental does his body in the presence of a superior, or perhaps he was sleepy, or merely a little drunk.", "Whatever it was he only mumbled, \"O yes,\" instead of contradicting so mad a remark.", "And the stranger led the way to the room where the telephone was.", "\"I think you will find my firm will give a good price for it,\" he said  and without more ado he began with a pair of pincers to cut the wire of the telephone and the receiver.", "The old waiter who looked after the club they had left shuffling round the other room putting things away for the night.", "\"Whatever are you doing of?\"", "said my friend.", "\"This way,\" said the stranger.", "Along a passage they went and away to the back of the club and there the stranger leaned out of a window and fastened the severed wires to the lightning conductor.", "My friend has no doubt of that, a broad ribbon of copper, half an inch wide, perhaps wider, running down from the roof to the earth.", "\"Hell,\" said the stranger with his mouth to the telephone; then silence for a while with his ear to the receiver, leaning out of the window.", "And then my friend heard his poor virtue being several times repeated, and then words like Yes and No.", "\"They offer you three jokes,\" said the stranger, \"which shall make all who hear them simply die of laughter.\"", "I think my friend was reluctant then to have anything more to do with it, he wanted to go home; he said he didn't want jokes.", "\"They think very highly of your virtue,\" I said the stranger.", "And at that, odd as it seems, my friend wavered, for logically if they thought highly of the goods they should have paid a higher price.", "\"O all right,\" he said.", "The extraordinary document that the agent drew from his pocket ran something like this   \"I .", ".", ".", ".", ".", "in consideration of three new jokes received from Mr.", "Montagu Montague, hereinafter to be called the agent, and warranted to be as by him stated and described, do assign to him, yield, abrogate and give up all recognitions, emoluments, perquisites or rewards due to me Here or Elsewhere on account of the following virtue, to wit and that is to say .", ".", ".", ".", ".", "that all women are to me equally ugly.\"", "The last eight words being filled in in ink by Mr.", "Montagu Montague.", "My poor friend duly signed it.", "\"These are the jokes,\" said the agent.", "They were boldly written on three slips of paper.", "\"They don't seem very funny,\" said the other when he had read them.", "\"You are immune,\" said Mr.", "Montagu Montague, \"but anyone else who hears them will simply die of laughter  that we guarantee.\"", "An American firm had bought at the price of waste paper a hundred thousand copies of The Dictionary of Electricity written when electricity was new,  and it had turned out that even at the time its author had not rightly grasped his subject,  the firm had paid £10,000 to a respectable English paper (no other in fact than the Briton) for the use of its name, and to obtain orders for The Briton Dictionary of Electricity was the occupation of my unfortunate friend.", "He seems to have had a way with him.", "Apparently he knew by a glance at a man, or a look round at his garden, whether to recommend the book as \"an absolutely up to date achievement, the finest thing of its kind in the world of modern science\" or as \"at once quaint and imperfect, a thing to buy and to keep as a tribute to those dear old times that are gone.\"", "So he went on with this quaint though usual business, putting aside the memory of that night as an occasion on which he had \"somewhat exceeded\" as they say in circles where a spade is called neither a spade nor an agricultural implement but is never mentioned at all, being altogether too vulgar.", "And then one night he put on his suit of dress clothes and found the three jokes in the pocket.", "That was perhaps a shock.", "He seems to have thought it over carefully then, and the end of it was he gave a dinner at the club to twenty of the members.", "The dinner would do no harm he thought  might even help the business, and if the joke came off he would be a witty fellow, and two jokes still up his sleeve.", "Whom he invited or how the dinner went I do not know for he began to speak rapidly and came straight to the point, as a stick that nears a cataract suddenly goes faster and faster.", "The dinner was duly served, the port went round, the twenty men were smoking, two waiters loitered, when he after carefully reading the best of the jokes told it down the table.", "They laughed.", "One man accidentally inhaled his cigar smoke and spluttered, the two waiters overheard and tittered behind their hands, one man, a bit of a raconteur himself, quite clearly wished not to laugh, but his veins swelled dangerously in trying to keep it back, and in the end he laughed too.", "The joke had succeeded; my friend smiled at the thought; he wished to say little deprecating things to the man on his right; but the laughter did not stop and the waiters would not be silent.", "He waited, and waited wondering; the laughter went roaring on, distinctly louder now, and the waiters as loud as any.", "It had gone on for three or four minutes when this frightful thought leaped up all at once in his mind  _it was forced laughter!_ However could anything have induced him to tell so foolish a joke?", "He saw its absurdity as in revelation; and the more he thought of it as these people laughed at him, even the waiters too, the more he felt that he could never lift up his head with his brother touts again.", "And still the laughter went roaring and choking on.", "He was very angry.", "There was not much use in having a friend, he thought, if one silly joke could not be overlooked; he had fed them too.", "And then he felt that he had no friends at all, and his anger faded away, and a great unhappiness came down on him, and he got quietly up and slunk from the room and slipped away from the club.", "Poor man, he scarcely had the heart next morning even to glance at the papers, but you did not need to glance at them, big type was bandied about that day as though it were common type, the words of the headlines stared at you; and the headlines said   Twenty Two Dead Men at a Club.", "Yes, he saw it then  the laughter had not stopped, some had probably burst blood vessels, some must have choked, some succumbed to nausea, heart failure must have mercifully taken some, and they were his friends after all, and none had escaped, not I even the waiters.", "It was that infernal joke.", "He thought out swiftly, and remembers clear as a nightmare, the drive to Victoria Station, the boat train to Dover and going disguised to the boat  and on the boat pleasantly smiling, almost obsequious, two constables that wished to speak for a moment with Mr.", "Watkyn Jones.", "That was his name.", "In a third class carriage with handcuffs on his wrists, with forced conversation when any, he returned between his captors to Victoria to be tried for murder at the High Court of Bow.", "At the trial he was defended by a young barrister of considerable ability who had gone into the Cabinet in order to enhance his forensic reputation.", "And he was ably defended.", "It is no exaggeration to say that the speech for the defence showed it to be usual, even natural and right, to give a dinner to twenty men and to slip away without ever saying a word, leaving all, with the waiters, dead.", "That was the impression left in the minds of the jury.", "And Mr.", "Watkyn Jones felt himself practically free, with all the advantages of his awful experience, and his two jokes intact.", "But lawyers are still experimenting with the new act which allows a prisoner to give evidence.", "They do not like to make no use of it for fear they may be thought not to know of the act, and a lawyer who is not in touch with the very latest laws is soon regarded as not being up to date and he may drop as much as £50,000 a year in fees.", "And therefore though it always hangs their clients they hardly like to neglect it.", "Mr.", "Watkyn Jones was put in the witness box.", "There he told the simple truth, and a very poor affair it seemed after the impassioned and beautiful things that were uttered by the counsel for the defence.", "Men and women had wept when they heard that.", "They did not weep when they heard Watkyn Jones.", "Some tittered.", "It no longer seemed a right and natural thing to leave one's guests all dead and to fly the country.", "Where was Justice, they asked, if anyone could do that?", "And when his story was told the judge rather happily asked if he could make him die of laughter too.", "And what was the joke?", "For in so grave a place as a Court of Justice no fatal effects need be feared.", "And hesitatingly the prisoner pulled from his pocket the three slips of paper  and perceived for the first time that the one on which the first and best joke had been written had become quite blank.", "Yet he could remember it, and only too clearly.", "And he told it from memory to the Court.", "\"An Irishman once on being asked by his master to buy a morning paper said in his usual witty way, 'Arrah and begorrah and I will be after wishing you the top of the morning.'\"", "No joke sounds quite so good the second time it is told, it seems to lose something of its essence, but Watkyn Jones was not prepared for the awful stillness with which this one was received; nobody smiled; and it had killed twenty two men.", "The joke was bad, devilish bad; counsel for the defence was frowning, and an usher was looking in a little bag for something the judge wanted.", "And at this moment, as though from far away, without his wishing it, there entered the prisoner's head, and shone there and would not go, this old bad proverb  \"As well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb.\"", "The jury seemed to be just about to retire.", "\"I have another joke,\" said Watkyn Jones, and then and there he read from the second slip of paper.", "He watched the paper curiously to see if it would go blank, occupying his mind with so slight a thing as men in dire distress very often do, and the words were almost immediately expunged, swept swiftly as if by a hand, and he saw the paper before him as blank as the first.", "And they were laughing this time, judge, jury, counsel for the prosecution, audience and all, and the grim men that watched him upon either side.", "There was no mistake about this joke.", "He did not stay to see the end, and walked out with his eyes fixed on the ground, unable to bear a glance to the right or left.", "And since then he has wandered, avoiding ports and roaming lonely places.", "Two years have known him on the Highland roads, often hungry, always friendless, always changing his district, wandering lonely on with his deadly joke.", "Sometimes for a moment he will enter inns, driven by cold and hunger, and hear men in the evening telling jokes and even challenging him; but he sits desolate and silent, lest his only weapon should escape from him and his last joke spread mourning in a hundred cots.", "His beard has grown and turned grey and is mixed with moss and weeds, so that no one, I think, not even the police, would recognise him now for that dapper tout that sold The Briton Dictionary of Electricity in such a different land.", "He paused, his story told, and then his lip quivered as though he would say more, and I believe he intended then and there to yield up his deadly joke on that Highland road and to go forth then with his three blank slips of paper, perhaps to a felon's cell, with one more murder added to his crimes, but harmless at last to man.", "I therefore hurried on, and only heard him mumbling sadly behind me, standing bowed and broken, all alone in the twilight, perhaps telling over and over even then the last infernal joke.", "PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 1781   Human reason, in one sphere of its cognition, is called upon to consider questions, which it cannot decline, as they are presented by its own nature, but which it cannot answer, as they transcend every faculty of the mind.", "It falls into this difficulty without any fault of its own.", "It begins with principles, which cannot be dispensed with in the field of experience, and the truth and sufficiency of which are, at the same time, insured by experience.", "With these principles it rises, in obedience to the laws of its own nature, to ever higher and more remote conditions.", "But it quickly discovers that, in this way, its labours must remain ever incomplete, because new questions never cease to present themselves; and thus it finds itself compelled to have recourse to principles which transcend the region of experience, while they are regarded by common sense without distrust.", "It thus falls into confusion and contradictions, from which it conjectures the presence of latent errors, which, however, it is unable to discover, because the principles it employs, transcending the limits of experience, cannot be tested by that criterion.", "The arena of these endless contests is called _Metaphysic_.", "Time was, when she was the _queen_ of all the sciences; and, if we take the will for the deed, she certainly deserves, so far as regards the high importance of her object matter, this title of honour.", "Now, it is the fashion of the time to heap contempt and scorn upon her; and the matron mourns, forlorn and forsaken, like Hecuba   Modo maxima rerum, Tot generis, natisque potens... Nunc trahor exul, inops.", "â€Ovid, Metamorphoses.", "xiii   At first, her government, under the administration of the _dogmatists_, was an absolute _despotism_.", "But, as the legislative continued to show traces of the ancient barbaric rule, her empire gradually broke up, and intestine wars introduced the reign of _anarchy;_ while the _sceptics_, like nomadic tribes, who hate a permanent habitation and settled mode of living, attacked from time to time those who had organized themselves into civil communities.", "But their number was, very happily, small; and thus they could not entirely put a stop to the exertions of those who persisted in raising new edifices, although on no settled or uniform plan.", "In recent times the hope dawned upon us of seeing those disputes settled, and the legitimacy of her claims established by a kind of _physiology_ of the human understandingâ€that of the celebrated Locke.", "But it was found thatâ€although it was affirmed that this so called queen could not refer her descent to any higher source than that of common experience, a circumstance which necessarily brought suspicion on her claimsâ€as this _genealogy_ was incorrect, she persisted in the advancement of her claims to sovereignty.", "Thus metaphysics necessarily fell back into the antiquated and rotten constitution of _dogmatism_, and again became obnoxious to the contempt from which efforts had been made to save it.", "At present, as all methods, according to the general persuasion, have been tried in vain, there reigns nought but weariness and complete _indifferentism_â€the mother of chaos and night in the scientific world, but at the same time the source of, or at least the prelude to, the re creation and reinstallation of a science, when it has fallen into confusion, obscurity, and disuse from ill directed effort.", "For it is in reality vain to profess _indifference_ in regard to such inquiries, the object of which cannot be indifferent to humanity.", "Besides, these pretended _indifferentists_, however much they may try to disguise themselves by the assumption of a popular style and by changes on the language of the schools, unavoidably fall into metaphysical declarations and propositions, which they profess to regard with so much contempt.", "At the same time, this indifference, which has arisen in the world of science, and which relates to that kind of knowledge which we should wish to see destroyed the last, is a phenomenon that well deserves our attention and reflection.", "It is plainly not the effect of the levity, but of the matured _judgement_[1] of the age, which refuses to be any longer entertained with illusory knowledge, It is, in fact, a call to reason, again to undertake the most laborious of all tasksâ€that of self examination, and to establish a tribunal, which may secure it in its well grounded claims, while it pronounces against all baseless assumptions and pretensions, not in an arbitrary manner, but according to its own eternal and unchangeable laws.", "This tribunal is nothing less than the _Critical Investigation of Pure Reason_.", "[1] We very often hear complaints of the shallowness of the present  age, and of the decay of profound science.", "But I do not think that  those which rest upon a secure foundation, such as mathematics,  physical science, etc., in the least deserve this reproach, but that  they rather maintain their ancient fame, and in the latter case,  indeed, far surpass it.", "The same would be the case with the other  kinds of cognition, if their principles were but firmly established.", "In the absence of this security, indifference, doubt, and finally,  severe criticism are rather signs of a profound habit of thought.", "Our  age is the age of criticism, to which everything must be subjected.", "The sacredness of religion, and the authority of legislation, are by  many regarded as grounds of exemption from the examination of this  tribunal.", "But, if they are exempted, they become the subjects of just  suspicion, and cannot lay claim to sincere respect, which reason  accords only to that which has stood the test of a free and public  examination.", "I do not mean by this a criticism of books and systems, but a critical inquiry into the faculty of reason, with reference to the cognitions to which it strives to attain _without the aid of experience;_ in other words, the solution of the question regarding the possibility or impossibility of metaphysics, and the determination of the origin, as well as of the extent and limits of this science.", "All this must be done on the basis of principles.", "This pathâ€the only one now remainingâ€has been entered upon by me; and I flatter myself that I have, in this way, discovered the cause ofâ€and consequently the mode of removingâ€all the errors which have hitherto set reason at variance with itself, in the sphere of non empirical thought.", "I have not returned an evasive answer to the questions of reason, by alleging the inability and limitation of the faculties of the mind; I have, on the contrary, examined them completely in the light of principles, and, after having discovered the cause of the doubts and contradictions into which reason fell, have solved them to its perfect satisfaction.", "It is true, these questions have not been solved as dogmatism, in its vain fancies and desires, had expected; for it can only be satisfied by the exercise of magical arts, and of these I have no knowledge.", "But neither do these come within the compass of our mental powers; and it was the duty of philosophy to destroy the illusions which had their origin in misconceptions, whatever darling hopes and valued expectations may be ruined by its explanations.", "My chief aim in this work has been thoroughness; and I make bold to say that there is not a single metaphysical problem that does not find its solution, or at least the key to its solution, here.", "Pure reason is a perfect unity; and therefore, if the principle presented by it prove to be insufficient for the solution of even a single one of those questions to which the very nature of reason gives birth, we must reject it, as we could not be perfectly certain of its sufficiency in the case of the others.", "While I say this, I think I see upon the countenance of the reader signs of dissatisfaction mingled with contempt, when he hears declarations which sound so boastful and extravagant; and yet they are beyond comparison more moderate than those advanced by the commonest author of the commonest philosophical programme, in which the dogmatist professes to demonstrate the simple nature of the soul, or the necessity of a primal being.", "Such a dogmatist promises to extend human knowledge beyond the limits of possible experience; while I humbly confess that this is completely beyond my power.", "Instead of any such attempt, I confine myself to the examination of reason alone and its pure thought; and I do not need to seek far for the sum total of its cognition, because it has its seat in my own mind.", "Besides, common logic presents me with a complete and systematic catalogue of all the simple operations of reason;

_or_ secondly, I may assume that the objects, or, which is the same thing, that _experience_, in which alone as given objects they are cognized, conform to my conceptionsâ€and then I am at no loss how to proceed.", "For experience itself is a mode of cognition which requires understanding.", "Before objects, are given to me, that is, _Ã  priori_, I must presuppose in myself laws of the understanding which are expressed in conceptions _Ã  priori_.", "To these conceptions, then, all the objects of experience must necessarily conform.", "Now there are objects which reason _thinks_, and that necessarily, but which cannot be given in experience, or, at least, cannot be given _so_ as reason thinks them.", "The attempt to think these objects will hereafter furnish an excellent test of the new method of thought which we have adopted, and which is based on the principle that we only cognize in things _Ã  priori_ that which we ourselves place in them.", "[4]   [4] This method, accordingly, which we have borrowed from the natural  philosopher, consists in seeking for the elements of pure reason in  that _which admits of confirmation or refutation by experiment_.", "Now  the propositions of pure reason, especially when they transcend the  limits of possible experience, do not admit of our making any  experiment with their _objects_, as in natural science.", "Hence, with  regard to those _conceptions_ and _principles_ which we assume _Ã   priori_, our only course will be to view them from two different  sides.", "We must regard one and the same conception, _on the one hand_,  in relation to experience as an object of the senses and of the  understanding, _on the other hand_, in relation to reason, isolated  and transcending the limits of experience, as an object of mere  thought.", "Now if we find that, when we regard things from this double  point of view, the result is in harmony with the principle of pure  reason, but that, when we regard them from a single point of view,  reason is involved in self contradiction, then the experiment will  establish the correctness of this distinction.", "This attempt succeeds as well as we could desire, and promises to metaphysics, in its first partâ€that is, where it is occupied with conceptions _Ã  priori_, of which the corresponding objects may be given in experienceâ€the certain course of science.", "For by this new method we are enabled perfectly to explain the possibility of _Ã  priori_ cognition, and, what is more, to demonstrate satisfactorily the laws which lie _Ã  priori_ at the foundation of nature, as the sum of the objects of experienceâ€neither of which was possible according to the procedure hitherto followed.", "But from this deduction of the faculty of _Ã  priori_ cognition in the first part of metaphysics, we derive a surprising result, and one which, to all appearance, militates against the great end of metaphysics, as treated in the second part.", "For we come to the conclusion that our faculty of cognition is unable to transcend the limits of possible experience; and yet this is precisely the most essential object of this science.", "The estimate of our rational cognition _Ã  priori_ at which we arrive is that it has only to do with phenomena, and that things in themselves, while possessing a real existence, lie beyond its sphere.", "Here we are enabled to put the justice of this estimate to the test.", "For that which of necessity impels us to transcend the limits of experience and of all phenomena is the _unconditioned_, which reason absolutely requires in things as they are in themselves, in order to complete the series of conditions.", "Now, if it appears that when, on the one hand, we assume that our cognition conforms to its objects as things in themselves, _the unconditioned cannot be thought without contradiction_, and that when, on the other hand, we assume that our representation of things as they are given to us, does not conform to these things as they are in themselves, but that these objects, as phenomena, conform to our mode of representation, _the contradiction disappears _ we shall then be convinced of the truth of that which we began by assuming for the sake of experiment; we may look upon it as established that the unconditioned does not lie in things as we know them, or as they are given to us, but in things as they are in themselves, beyond the range of our cognition.", "[5]   [5] This experiment of pure reason has a great similarity to that of  the _Chemists_, which they term the experiment of _reduction_, or,  more usually, the _synthetic_ process.", "The _analysis_ of the  metaphysician separates pure cognition _Ã  priori_ into two  heterogeneous elements, viz., the cognition of things as phenomena,  and of things in themselves.", "_Dialectic_ combines these again into  harmony with the necessary rational idea of the unconditioned, and  finds that this harmony never results except through the above  distinction, which is, therefore, concluded to be just.", "But, after we have thus denied the power of speculative reason to make any progress in the sphere of the supersensible, it still remains for our consideration whether data do not exist in _practical_ cognition which may enable us to determine the transcendent conception of the unconditioned, to rise beyond the limits of all possible experience from a _practical_ point of view, and thus to satisfy the great ends of metaphysics.", "Speculative reason has thus, at least, made room for such an extension of our knowledge  and, if it must leave this space vacant, still it does not rob us of the liberty to fill it up, if we can, by means of practical dataâ€nay, it even challenges us to make the attempt.", "[6]   [6] So the central laws of the movements of the heavenly bodies  established the truth of that which Copernicus, first, assumed only as  a hypothesis, and, at the same time, brought to light that invisible  force (Newtonian attraction) which holds the universe together.", "The  latter would have remained forever undiscovered, if Copernicus had not  ventured on the experimentâ€contrary to the senses but still justâ€of  looking for the observed movements not in the heavenly bodies, but in  the spectator.", "In this Preface I treat the new metaphysical method as  a hypothesis with the view of rendering apparent the first attempts at  such a change of method, which are always hypothetical.", "But in the  Critique itself it will be demonstrated, not hypothetically, but  apodeictically, from the nature of our representations of space and  time, and from the elementary conceptions of the understanding.", "This attempt to introduce a complete revolution in the procedure of metaphysics, after the _example_ of the geometricians and natural philosophers, constitutes the aim of the Critique of Pure Speculative Reason.", "It is a treatise on the method to be followed, not a system of the science itself.", "But, at the same time, it marks out and defines both the external boundaries and the internal structure of this science.", "For pure speculative reason has this peculiarity, that, in choosing the various objects of thought, it is able to define the limits of its own faculties, and even to give a complete enumeration of the possible modes of proposing problems to itself, and thus to sketch out the entire system of metaphysics.", "For, on the one hand, in cognition _Ã  priori_, nothing must be attributed to the objects but what the thinking subject derives from itself; and, on the other hand, reason is, in regard to the principles of cognition, a perfectly distinct, independent unity, in which, as in an organized body, every member exists for the sake of the others, and all for the sake of each, so that no principle can be viewed, with safety, in one relationship, unless it is, at the same time, viewed in relation to the total use of pure reason.", "Hence, too, metaphysics has this singular advantageâ€an advantage which falls to the lot of no other science which has to do with _objects_â€that, if once it is conducted into the sure path of science, by means of this criticism, it can then take in the whole sphere of its cognitions, and can thus complete its work, and leave it for the use of posterity, as a capital which can never receive fresh accessions.", "For metaphysics has to deal only with principles and with the limitations of its own employment as determined by these principles.", "To this perfection it is, therefore, bound, as the fundamental science, to attain, and to it the maxim may justly be applied    Nil actum reputans, si quid superesset agendum.", "But, it will be asked, what kind of a treasure is this that we propose to bequeath to posterity?", "What is the real value of this system of metaphysics, purified by criticism, and thereby reduced to a permanent condition?", "A cursory view of the present work will lead to the supposition that its use is merely _negative_, that it only serves to warn us against venturing, with speculative reason, beyond the limits of experience.", "This is, in fact, its primary use.", "But this, at once, assumes a _positive_ value, when we observe that the principles with which speculative reason endeavours to transcend its limits lead inevitably, not to the _extension_, but to the _contraction_ of the use of reason, inasmuch as they threaten to extend the limits of sensibility, which is their proper sphere, over the entire realm of thought and, thus, to supplant the pure (practical) use of reason.", "So far, then, as this criticism is occupied in confining speculative reason within its proper bounds, it is only negative; but, inasmuch as it thereby, at the same time, removes an obstacle which impedes and even threatens to destroy the use of practical reason, it possesses a positive and very important value.", "In order to admit this, we have only to be convinced that there is an absolutely necessary use of pure reasonâ€the moral useâ€in which it inevitably transcends the limits of sensibility, without the aid of speculation, requiring only to be insured against the effects of a speculation which would involve it in contradiction with itself.", "To deny the positive advantage of the service which this criticism renders us would be as absurd as to maintain that the system of police is productive of no positive benefit, since its main business is to prevent the violence which citizen has to apprehend from citizen, that so each may pursue his vocation in peace and security.", "That space and time are only forms of sensible intuition, and hence are only conditions of the existence of things as phenomena; that, moreover, we have no conceptions of the understanding, and, consequently, no elements for the cognition of things, except in so far as a corresponding intuition can be given to these conceptions; that, accordingly, we can have no cognition of an object, as a thing in itself, but only as an object of sensible intuition, that is, as phenomenonâ€all this is proved in the analytical part of the Critique; and from this the limitation of all possible speculative cognition to the mere objects of _experience_, follows as a necessary result.", "At the same time, it must be carefully borne in mind that, while we surrender the power of _cognizing_, we still reserve the power of _thinking_ objects, as things in themselves.", "[7] For, otherwise, we should require to affirm the existence of an appearance, without something that appearsâ€which would be absurd.", "Now let us suppose, for a moment, that we had not undertaken this criticism and, accordingly, had not drawn the necessary distinction between things as objects of experience and things as they are in themselves.", "The principle of causality, and, by consequence, the mechanism of nature as determined by causality, would then have absolute validity in relation to all things as efficient causes.", "I should then be unable to assert, with regard to one and the same being, e.g., the human soul, that its will is _free_, and yet, at the same time, subject to natural necessity, that is, _not free_, without falling into a palpable contradiction, for in both propositions I should take the soul in _the same signification_, as a thing in general, as a thing in itselfâ€as, without previous criticism, I could not but take it.", "Suppose now, on the other hand, that we _have_ undertaken this criticism, and have learnt that an object may be taken in _two senses_, first, as a phenomenon, secondly, as a thing in itself; and that, according to the deduction of the conceptions of the understanding, the principle of causality has reference only to things in the first sense.", "We then see how it does not involve any contradiction to assert, on the one hand, that the will, in the phenomenal sphereâ€in visible actionâ€is necessarily obedient to the law of nature, and, in so far, _not free;_ and, on the other hand, that, as belonging to a thing in itself, it is not subject to that law, and, accordingly, is _free_.", "Now, it is true that I cannot, by means of speculative reason, and still less by empirical observation, _cognize_ my soul as a thing in itself and consequently, cannot cognize liberty as the property of a being to which I ascribe effects in the world of sense.", "For, to do so, I must cognize this being as existing, and yet not in time, whichâ€since I cannot support my conception by any intuitionâ€is impossible.", "At the same time, while I cannot _cognize_, I can quite well _think_ freedom, that is to say, my representation of it involves at least no contradiction, if we bear in mind the critical distinction of the two modes of representation (the sensible and the intellectual) and the consequent limitation of the conceptions of the pure understanding and of the principles which flow from them.", "Suppose now that morality necessarily presupposed liberty, in the strictest sense, as a property of our will; suppose that reason contained certain practical, original principles _Ã  priori_, which were absolutely impossible without this presupposition; and suppose, at the same time, that speculative reason had proved that liberty was incapable of being thought at all.", "It would then follow that the moral presupposition must give way to the speculative affirmation, the opposite of which involves an obvious contradiction, and that _liberty_ and, with it, morality must yield to the _mechanism of nature;_ for the negation of morality involves no contradiction, except on the presupposition of liberty.", "Now morality does not require the speculative cognition of liberty; it is enough that I can think it, that its conception involves no contradiction, that it does not interfere with the mechanism of nature.", "But even this requirement we could not satisfy, if we had not learnt the twofold sense in which things may be taken;

that is, provided my conception is a  possible thought, though I may be unable to answer for the existence  of a corresponding object in the sum of possibilities.", "But something  more is required before I can attribute to such a conception objective  validity, that is real possibilityâ€the other possibility being merely  logical.", "We are not, however, confined to theoretical sources of  cognition for the means of satisfying this additional requirement, but  may derive them from practical sources.", "The positive value of the critical principles of pure reason in relation to the conception of _God_ and of the _simple nature_ of the _soul_, admits of a similar exemplification; but on this point I shall not dwell.", "I cannot even make the assumptionâ€as the practical interests of morality requireâ€of God, freedom, and immortality, if I do not deprive speculative reason of its pretensions to transcendent insight.", "For to arrive at these, it must make use of principles which, in fact, extend only to the objects of possible experience, and which cannot be applied to objects beyond this sphere without converting them into phenomena, and thus rendering the _practical extension_ of pure reason impossible.", "I must, therefore, abolish _knowledge_, to make room for _belief_.", "The dogmatism of metaphysics, that is, the presumption that it is possible to advance in metaphysics without previous criticism, is the true source of the unbelief (always dogmatic) which militates against morality.", "Thus, while it may be no very difficult task to bequeath a legacy to posterity, in the shape of a system of metaphysics constructed in accordance with the Critique of Pure Reason, still the value of such a bequest is not to be depreciated.", "It will render an important service to reason, by substituting the certainty of scientific method for that random groping after results without the guidance of principles, which has hitherto characterized the pursuit of metaphysical studies.", "It will render an important service to the inquiring mind of youth, by leading the student to apply his powers to the cultivation of genuine science, instead of wasting them, as at present, on speculations which can never lead to any result, or on the idle attempt to invent new ideas and opinions.", "But, above all, it will confer an inestimable benefit on morality and religion, by showing that all the objections urged against them may be silenced for ever by the _Socratic_ method, that is to say, by proving the ignorance of the objector.", "For, as the world has never been, and, no doubt, never will be without a system of metaphysics of one kind or another, it is the highest and weightiest concern of philosophy to render it powerless for harm, by closing up the sources of error.", "This important change in the field of the sciences, this loss of its fancied possessions, to which speculative reason must submit, does not prove in any way detrimental to the general interests of humanity.", "The advantages which the world has derived from the teachings of pure reason are not at all impaired.", "The loss falls, in its whole extent, on the _monopoly of the schools_, but does not in the slightest degree touch the _interests of mankind_.", "I appeal to the most obstinate dogmatist, whether the proof of the continued existence of the soul after death, derived from the simplicity of its substance; of the freedom of the will in opposition to the general mechanism of nature, drawn from the subtle but impotent distinction of subjective and objective practical necessity; or of the existence of God, deduced from the conception of an _ens realissimum_â€the contingency of the changeable, and the necessity of a prime mover, has ever been able to pass beyond the limits of the schools, to penetrate the public mind, or to exercise the slightest influence on its convictions.", "It must be admitted that this has not been the case and that, owing to the unfitness of the common understanding for such subtle speculations, it can never be expected to take place.", "On the contrary, it is plain that _the hope of a future life_ arises from the feeling, which exists in the breast of every man, that the temporal is inadequate to meet and satisfy the demands of his nature.", "In like manner, it cannot be doubted that the clear exhibition of duties in opposition to all the claims of inclination, gives rise to the consciousness of _freedom_, and that the glorious order, beauty, and providential care, everywhere displayed in nature, give rise to the belief in a wise and great Author of the Universe.", "Such is the genesis of these general convictions of mankind, so far as they depend on rational grounds; and this public property not only remains undisturbed, but is even raised to greater importance, by the doctrine that the schools have no right to arrogate to themselves a more profound insight into a matter of general human concernment than that to which the great mass of men, ever held by us in the highest estimation, can without difficulty attain, and that the schools should, therefore, confine themselves to the elaboration of these universally comprehensible and, from a moral point of view, amply satisfactory proofs.", "The change, therefore, affects only the arrogant pretensions of the schools, which would gladly retain, in their own exclusive possession, the key to the truths which they impart to the public.", "Quod mecum nescit, solus vult scire videri.", "At the same time it does not deprive the speculative philosopher of his just title to be the sole depositor of a science which benefits the public without its knowledgeâ€I mean, the Critique of Pure Reason.", "This can never become popular and, indeed, has no occasion to be so; for finespun arguments in favour of useful truths make just as little impression on the public mind as the equally subtle objections brought against these truths.", "On the other hand, since both inevitably force themselves on every man who rises to the height of speculation, it becomes the manifest duty of the schools to enter upon a thorough investigation of the rights of speculative reason and, thus, to prevent the scandal which metaphysical controversies are sure, sooner or later, to cause even to the masses.", "It is only by criticism that metaphysicians (and, as such, theologians too) can be saved from these controversies and from the consequent perversion of their doctrines.", "Criticism alone can strike a blow at the root of materialism, fatalism, atheism, free thinking, fanaticism, and superstition, which are universally injuriousâ€as well as of idealism and scepticism, which are dangerous to the schools, but can scarcely pass over to the public.", "If governments think proper to interfere with the affairs of the learned, it would be more consistent with a wise regard for the interests of science, as well as for those of society, to favour a criticism of this kind, by which alone the labours of reason can be established on a firm basis, than to support the ridiculous despotism of the schools, which raise a loud cry of danger to the public over the destruction of cobwebs, of which the public has never taken any notice, and the loss of which, therefore, it can never feel.", "This critical science is not opposed to the _dogmatic procedure_ of reason in pure cognition;

and the reality of this  something, as opposed to the mere imagination of it, rests solely on  its inseparable connection with internal experience as the condition  of its possibility.", "If with the _intellectual consciousness_ of my  existence, in the representation  _I am_, which accompanies all my  judgements, and all the operations of my understanding, I could, at  the same time, connect a determination of my existence by  _intellectual intuition_, then the consciousness of a relation to  something external to me would not be necessary.", "But the internal  intuition in which alone my existence can be determined, though  preceded by that purely intellectual consciousness, is itself sensible  and attached to the condition of time.", "Hence this determination of my  existence, and consequently my internal experience itself, must depend  on something permanent which is not in me, which can be, therefore,  only in something external to me, to which I must look upon myself as  being related.", "Thus the reality of the external sense is necessarily  connected with that of the internal, in order to the possibility of  experience in general; that is, I am just as certainly conscious that  there are things external to me related to my sense as I am that I  myself exist as determined in time.", "But in order to ascertain to what  given intuitions objects, external me, really correspond, in other  words, what intuitions belong to the external sense and not to  imagination, I must have recourse, in every particular case, to those  rules according to which experience in general (even internal  experience) is distinguished from imagination, and which are always  based on the proposition that there really is an external  experience.â€We may add the remark that the representation of something  _permanent_ in existence, is not the same thing as the _permanent  representation;_ for a representation may be very variable and  changingâ€as all our representations, even that of matter, areâ€and yet  refer to something permanent, which must, therefore, be distinct from  all my representations and external to me, the existence of which is  necessarily included in the determination of my own existence, and  with it constitutes _one_ experienceâ€an experience which would not  even be possible internally, if it were not also at the same time, in  part, external.", "To the question _How?_ we are no more able to reply,  than we are, in general, to think the stationary in time, the  coexistence of which with the variable, produces the conception of  change.", "In attempting to render the exposition of my views as intelligible as possible, I have been compelled to leave out or abridge various passages which were not essential to the completeness of the work, but which many readers might consider useful in other respects, and might be unwilling to miss.", "This trifling loss, which could not be avoided without swelling the book beyond due limits, may be supplied, at the pleasure of the reader, by a comparison with the first edition, and will, I hope, be more than compensated for by the greater clearness of the exposition as it now stands.", "I have observed, with pleasure and thankfulness, in the pages of various reviews and treatises, that the spirit of profound and thorough investigation is not extinct in Germany, though it may have been overborne and silenced for a time by the fashionable tone of a licence in thinking, which gives itself the airs of genius, and that the difficulties which beset the paths of criticism have not prevented energetic and acute thinkers from making themselves masters of the science of pure reason to which these paths conductâ€a science which is not popular, but scholastic in its character, and which alone can hope for a lasting existence or possess an abiding value.", "To these deserving men, who so happily combine profundity of view with a talent for lucid expositionâ€a talent which I myself am not conscious of possessingâ€I leave the task of removing any obscurity which may still adhere to the statement of my doctrines.", "For, in this case, the danger is not that of being refuted, but of being misunderstood.", "For my own part, I must henceforward abstain from controversy, although I shall carefully attend to all suggestions, whether from friends or adversaries, which may be of use in the future elaboration of the system of this PropÃ¦deutic.", "As, during these labours, I have advanced pretty far in years this month I reach my sixty fourth yearâ€it will be necessary for me to economize time, if I am to carry out my plan of elaborating the metaphysics of nature as well as of morals, in confirmation of the correctness of the principles established in this Critique of Pure Reason, both speculative and practical;

Of the difference between Pure and Empirical Knowledge   That all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt.", "For how is it possible that the faculty of cognition should be awakened into exercise otherwise than by means of objects which affect our senses, and partly of themselves produce representations, partly rouse our powers of understanding into activity, to compare to connect, or to separate these, and so to convert the raw material of our sensuous impressions into a knowledge of objects, which is called experience?", "In respect of time, therefore, no knowledge of ours is antecedent to experience, but begins with it.", "But, though all our knowledge begins with experience, it by no means follows that all arises out of experience.", "For, on the contrary, it is quite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we receive through impressions, and that which the faculty of cognition supplies from itself (sensuous impressions giving merely the occasion), an addition which we cannot distinguish from the original element given by sense, till long practice has made us attentive to, and skilful in separating it.", "It is, therefore, a question which requires close investigation, and not to be answered at first sight, whether there exists a knowledge altogether independent of experience, and even of all sensuous impressions?", "Knowledge of this kind is called Ã  priori, in contradistinction to empirical knowledge, which has its sources Ã  posteriori, that is, in experience.", "But the expression, â€œÃ  priori,â€ is not as yet definite enough adequately to indicate the whole meaning of the question above started.", "For, in speaking of knowledge which has its sources in experience, we are wont to say, that this or that may be known Ã  priori, because we do not derive this knowledge immediately from experience, but from a general rule, which, however, we have itself borrowed from experience.", "Thus, if a man undermined his house, we say, â€œhe might know Ã  priori that it would have fallen;â€ that is, he needed not to have waited for the experience that it did actually fall.", "But still, Ã  priori, he could not know even this much.", "For, that bodies are heavy, and, consequently, that they fall when their supports are taken away, must have been known to him previously, by means of experience.", "By the term â€œknowledge Ã  priori,â€ therefore, we shall in the sequel understand, not such as is independent of this or that kind of experience, but such as is absolutely so of all experience.", "Opposed to this is empirical knowledge, or that which is possible only Ã  posteriori, that is, through experience.", "Knowledge Ã  priori is either pure or impure.", "Pure knowledge Ã  priori is that with which no empirical element is mixed up.", "For example, the proposition, â€œEvery change has a cause,â€ is a proposition Ã  priori, but impure, because change is a conception which can only be derived from experience.", "II.", "The Human Intellect, even in an Unphilosophical State, is in Possession of Certain Cognitions â€œÃ  prioriâ€.", "The question now is as to a criterion, by which we may securely distinguish a pure from an empirical cognition.", "Experience no doubt teaches us that this or that object is constituted in such and such a manner, but not that it could not possibly exist otherwise.", "Now, in the first place, if we have a proposition which contains the idea of necessity in its very conception, it is priori.", "If, moreover, it is not derived from any other proposition, unless from one equally involving the idea of necessity, it is absolutely priori.", "Secondly, an empirical judgement never exhibits strict and absolute, but only assumed and comparative universality (by induction); therefore, the most we can say isâ€so far as we have hitherto observed, there is no exception to this or that rule.", "If, on the other hand, a judgement carries with it strict and absolute universality, that is, admits of no possible exception, it is not derived from experience, but is valid absolutely Ã  priori.", "Empirical universality is, therefore, only an arbitrary extension of validity, from that which may be predicated of a proposition valid in most cases, to that which is asserted of a proposition which holds good in all; as, for example, in the affirmation, â€œAll bodies are heavy.â€ When, on the contrary, strict universality characterizes a judgement, it necessarily indicates another peculiar source of knowledge, namely, a faculty of cognition Ã  priori.", "Necessity and strict universality, therefore, are infallible tests for distinguishing pure from empirical knowledge, and are inseparably connected with each other.", "But as in the use of these criteria the empirical limitation is sometimes more easily detected than the contingency of the judgement, or the unlimited universality which we attach to a judgement is often a more convincing proof than its necessity, it may be advisable to use the criteria separately, each being by itself infallible.", "Now, that in the sphere of human cognition we have judgements which are necessary, and in the strictest sense universal, consequently pure Ã  priori, it will be an easy matter to show.", "If we desire an example from the sciences, we need only take any proposition in mathematics.", "If we cast our eyes upon the commonest operations of the understanding, the proposition, â€œEvery change must have a cause,â€ will amply serve our purpose.", "In the latter case, indeed, the conception of a cause so plainly involves the conception of a necessity of connection with an effect, and of a strict universality of the law, that the very notion of a cause would entirely disappear, were we to derive it, like Hume, from a frequent association of what happens with that which precedes; and the habit thence originating of connecting representationsâ€the necessity inherent in the judgement being therefore merely subjective.", "Besides, without seeking for such examples of principles existing Ã  priori in cognition, we might easily show that such principles are the indispensable basis of the possibility of experience itself, and consequently prove their existence Ã  priori.", "For whence could our experience itself acquire certainty, if all the rules on which it depends were themselves empirical, and consequently fortuitous?", "No one, therefore, can admit the validity of the use of such rules as first principles.", "But, for the present, we may content ourselves with having established the fact, that we do possess and exercise a faculty of pure Ã  priori cognition; and, secondly, with having pointed out the proper tests of such cognition, namely, universality and necessity.", "Not only in judgements, however, but even in conceptions, is an Ã  priori origin manifest.", "For example, if we take away by degrees from our conceptions of a body all that can be referred to mere sensuous experienceâ€colour, hardness or softness, weight, even impenetrabilityâ€the body will then vanish; but the space which it occupied still remains, and this it is utterly impossible to annihilate in thought.", "Again, if we take away, in like manner, from our empirical conception of any object, corporeal or incorporeal, all properties which mere experience has taught us to connect with it, still we cannot think away those through which we cogitate it as substance, or adhering to substance, although our conception of substance is more determined than that of an object.", "Compelled, therefore, by that necessity with which the conception of substance forces itself upon us, we must confess that it has its seat in our faculty of cognition Ã  priori.", "III.", "Philosophy stands in need of a Science which shall Determine the Possibility, Principles, and Extent of Human Knowledge â€œÃ  prioriâ€  Of far more importance than all that has been above said, is the consideration that certain of our cognitions rise completely above the sphere of all possible experience, and by means of conceptions, to which there exists in the whole extent of experience no corresponding object, seem to extend the range of our judgements beyond its bounds.", "And just in this transcendental or supersensible sphere, where experience affords us neither instruction nor guidance, lie the investigations of reason, which, on account of their importance, we consider far preferable to, and as having a far more elevated aim than, all that the understanding can achieve within the sphere of sensuous phenomena.", "So high a value do we set upon these investigations, that even at the risk of error, we persist in following them out, and permit neither doubt nor disregard nor indifference to restrain us from the pursuit.", "These unavoidable problems of mere pure reason are God, freedom (of will), and immortality.", "The science which, with all its preliminaries, has for its especial object the solution of these problems is named metaphysicsâ€a science which is at the very outset dogmatical, that is, it confidently takes upon itself the execution of this task without any previous investigation of the ability or inability of reason for such an undertaking.", "Now the safe ground of experience being thus abandoned, it seems nevertheless natural that we should hesitate to erect a building with the cognitions we possess, without knowing whence they come, and on the strength of principles, the origin of which is undiscovered.", "Instead of thus trying to build without a foundation, it is rather to be expected that we should long ago have put the question, how the understanding can arrive at these Ã  priori cognitions, and what is the extent, validity, and worth which they may possess?", "We say, â€œThis is natural enough,â€ meaning by the word natural, that which is consistent with a just and reasonable way of thinking; but if we understand by the term, that which usually happens, nothing indeed could be more natural and more comprehensible than that this investigation should be left long unattempted.", "For one part of our pure knowledge, the science of mathematics, has been long firmly established, and thus leads us to form flattering expectations with regard to others, though these may be of quite a different nature.", "Besides, when we get beyond the bounds of experience, we are of course safe from opposition in that quarter; and the charm of widening the range of our knowledge is so great that, unless we are brought to a standstill by some evident contradiction, we hurry on undoubtingly in our course.", "This, however, may be avoided, if we are sufficiently cautious in the construction of our fictions, which are not the less fictions on that account.", "Mathematical science affords us a brilliant example, how far, independently of all experience, we may carry our Ã  priori knowledge.", "It is true that the mathematician occupies himself with objects and cognitions only in so far as they can be represented by means of intuition.", "But this circumstance is easily overlooked, because the said intuition can itself be given Ã  priori, and therefore is hardly to be distinguished from a mere pure conception.", "Deceived by such a proof of the power of reason, we can perceive no limits to the extension of our knowledge.", "The light dove cleaving in free flight the thin air, whose resistance it feels, might imagine that her movements would be far more free and rapid in airless space.", "Just in the same way did Plato, abandoning the world of sense because of the narrow limits it sets to the understanding, venture upon the wings of ideas beyond it, into the void space of pure intellect.", "He did not reflect that he made no real progress by all his efforts; for he met with no resistance which might serve him for a support, as it were, whereon to rest, and on which he might apply his powers, in order to let the intellect acquire momentum for its progress.", "It is, indeed, the common fate of human reason in speculation, to finish the imposing edifice of thought as rapidly as possible, and then for the first time to begin to examine whether the foundation is a solid one or no.", "Arrived at this point, all sorts of excuses are sought after, in order to console us for its want of stability, or rather, indeed, to enable Us to dispense altogether with so late and dangerous an investigation.", "But what frees us during the process of building from all apprehension or suspicion, and flatters us into the belief of its solidity, is this.", "A great part, perhaps the greatest part, of the business of our reason consists in the analysation of the conceptions which we already possess of objects.", "By this means we gain a multitude of cognitions, which although really nothing more than elucidations or explanations of that which (though in a confused manner) was already thought in our conceptions, are, at least in respect of their form, prized as new introspections; whilst, so far as regards their matter or content, we have really made no addition to our conceptions, but only disinvolved them.", "But as this process does furnish a real priori knowledge, which has a sure progress and useful results, reason, deceived by this, slips in, without being itself aware of it, assertions of a quite different kind; in which, to given conceptions it adds others, Ã  priori indeed, but entirely foreign to them, without our knowing how it arrives at these, and, indeed, without such a question ever suggesting itself.", "I shall therefore at once proceed to examine the difference between these two modes of knowledge.", "IV.", "Of the Difference Between Analytical and Synthetical Judgements.", "In all judgements wherein the relation of a subject to the predicate is cogitated (I mention affirmative judgements only here;

or the predicate B lies completely out of the conception A, although it stands in connection with it.", "In the first instance, I term the judgement analytical, in the second, synthetical.", "Analytical judgements (affirmative) are therefore those in which the connection of the predicate with the subject is cogitated through identity;

and the manner in which these representations are given in the mind without spontaneity, must, on account of this difference (the want of spontaneity), be called sensibility.", "If the faculty of self consciousness is to apprehend what lies in the mind, it must all act that and can in this way alone produce an intuition of self.", "But the form of this intuition, which lies in the original constitution of the mind, determines, in the representation of time, the manner in which the manifold representations are to combine themselves in the mind; since the subject intuites itself, not as it would represent itself immediately and spontaneously, but according to the manner in which the mind is internally affected, consequently, as it appears, and not as it is.", "III.", "When we say that the intuition of external objects, and also the self intuition of the subject, represent both, objects and subject, in space and time, as they affect our senses, that is, as they appearâ€this is by no means equivalent to asserting that these objects are mere illusory appearances.", "For when we speak of things as phenomena, the objects, nay, even the properties which we ascribe to them, are looked upon as really given; only that, in so far as this or that property depends upon the mode of intuition of the subject, in the relation of the given object to the subject, the object as phenomenon is to be distinguished from the object as a thing in itself.", "Thus I do not say that bodies seem or appear to be external to me, or that my soul seems merely to be given in my self consciousness, although I maintain that the properties of space and time, in conformity to which I set both, as the condition of their existence, abide in my mode of intuition, and not in the objects in themselves.", "It would be my own fault, if out of that which I should reckon as phenomenon, I made mere illusory appearance.", "[12] But this will not happen, because of our principle of the ideality of all sensuous intuitions.", "On the contrary, if we ascribe objective reality to these forms of representation, it becomes impossible to avoid changing everything into mere appearance.", "For if we regard space and time as properties, which must be found in objects as things in themselves, as sine quibus non of the possibility of their existence, and reflect on the absurdities in which we then find ourselves involved, inasmuch as we are compelled to admit the existence of two infinite things, which are nevertheless not substances, nor anything really inhering in substances, nay, to admit that they are the necessary conditions of the existence of all things, and moreover, that they must continue to exist, although all existing things were annihilatedâ€we cannot blame the good Berkeley for degrading bodies to mere illusory appearances.", "Nay, even our own existence, which would in this case depend upon the self existent reality of such a mere nonentity as time, would necessarily be changed with it into mere appearanceâ€an absurdity which no one has as yet been guilty of.", "[12] The predicates of the phenomenon can be affixed to the object  itself in relation to our sensuous faculty; for example, the red  colour or the perfume to the rose.", "But (illusory) appearance never can  be attributed as a predicate to an object, for this very reason, that  it attributes to this object in itself that which belongs to it only  in relation to our sensuous faculty, or to the subject in general,  e.g., the two handles which were formerly ascribed to Saturn.", "That  which is never to be found in the object itself, but always in the  relation of the object to the subject, and which moreover is  inseparable from our representation of the object, we denominate  phenomenon.", "Thus the predicates of space and time are rightly  attributed to objects of the senses as such, and in this there is no  illusion.", "On the contrary, if I ascribe redness of the rose as a thing  in itself, or to Saturn his handles, or extension to all external  objects, considered as things in themselves, without regarding the  determinate relation of these objects to the subject, and without  limiting my judgement to that relationâ€then, and then only, arises  illusion.", "IV.", "In natural theology, where we think of an objectâ€Godâ€which never can be an object of intuition to us, and even to himself can never be an object of sensuous intuition, we carefully avoid attributing to his intuition the conditions of space and timeâ€and intuition all his cognition must be, and not thought, which always includes limitation.", "But with what right can we do this if we make them forms of objects as things in themselves, and such, moreover, as would continue to exist as Ã  priori conditions of the existence of things, even though the things themselves were annihilated?", "For as conditions of all existence in general, space and time must be conditions of the existence of the Supreme Being also.", "But if we do not thus make them objective forms of all things, there is no other way left than to make them subjective forms of our mode of intuitionâ€external and internal;

through the second, it is, in relation to the representation (which is a mere determination of the mind), thought.", "Intuition and conceptions constitute, therefore, the elements of all our knowledge, so that neither conceptions without an intuition in some way corresponding to them, nor intuition without conceptions, can afford us a cognition.", "Both are either pure or empirical.", "They are empirical, when sensation (which presupposes the actual presence of the object) is contained in them; and pure, when no sensation is mixed with the representation.", "Sensations we may call the matter of sensuous cognition.", "Pure intuition consequently contains merely the form under which something is intuited, and pure conception only the form of the thought of an object.", "Only pure intuitions and pure conceptions are possible Ã  priori; the empirical only Ã  posteriori.", "We apply the term sensibility to the receptivity of the mind for impressions, in so far as it is in some way affected; and, on the other hand, we call the faculty of spontaneously producing representations, or the spontaneity of cognition, understanding.", "Our nature is so constituted that intuition with us never can be other than sensuous, that is, it contains only the mode in which we are affected by objects.", "On the other hand, the faculty of thinking the object of sensuous intuition is the understanding.", "Neither of these faculties has a preference over the other.", "Without the sensuous faculty no object would be given to us, and without the understanding no object would be thought.", "Thoughts without content are void; intuitions without conceptions, blind.", "Hence it is as necessary for the mind to make its conceptions sensuous (that is, to join to them the object in intuition), as to make its intuitions intelligible (that is, to bring them under conceptions).", "Neither of these faculties can exchange its proper function.", "Understanding cannot intuite, and the sensuous faculty cannot think.", "In no other way than from the united operation of both, can knowledge arise.", "But no one ought, on this account, to overlook the difference of the elements contributed by each; we have rather great reason carefully to separate and distinguish them.", "We therefore distinguish the science of the laws of sensibility, that is, Ã¦sthetic, from the science of the laws of the understanding, that is, logic.", "Now, logic in its turn may be considered as twofoldâ€namely, as logic of the general, or of the particular use of the understanding.", "The first contains the absolutely necessary laws of thought, without which no use whatsoever of the understanding is possible, and gives laws therefore to the understanding, without regard to the difference of objects on which it may be employed.", "The logic of the particular use of the understanding contains the laws of correct thinking upon a particular class of objects.", "The former may be called elemental logicâ€the latter, the organon of this or that particular science.", "The latter is for the most part employed in the schools, as a propÃ¦deutic to the sciences, although, indeed, according to the course of human reason, it is the last thing we arrive at, when the science has been already matured, and needs only the finishing touches towards its correction and completion; for our knowledge of the objects of our attempted science must be tolerably extensive and complete before we can indicate the laws by which a science of these objects can be established.", "General logic is again either pure or applied.", "In the former, we abstract all the empirical conditions under which the understanding is exercised; for example, the influence of the senses, the play of the fantasy or imagination, the laws of the memory, the force of habit, of inclination, etc., consequently also, the sources of prejudiceâ€in a word, we abstract all causes from which particular cognitions arise, because these causes regard the understanding under certain circumstances of its application, and, to the knowledge of them experience is required.", "Pure general logic has to do, therefore, merely with pure Ã  priori principles, and is a canon of understanding and reason, but only in respect of the formal part of their use, be the content what it may, empirical or transcendental.", "General logic is called applied, when it is directed to the laws of the use of the understanding, under the subjective empirical conditions which psychology teaches us.", "It has therefore empirical principles, although, at the same time, it is in so far general, that it applies to the exercise of the understanding, without regard to the difference of objects.", "On this account, moreover, it is neither a canon of the understanding in general, nor an organon of a particular science, but merely a cathartic of the human understanding.", "In general logic, therefore, that part which constitutes pure logic must be carefully distinguished from that which constitutes applied (though still general) logic.", "The former alone is properly science, although short and dry, as the methodical exposition of an elemental doctrine of the understanding ought to be.", "In this, therefore, logicians must always bear in mind two rules   1.", "As general logic, it makes abstraction of all content of the cognition of the understanding, and of the difference of objects, and has to do with nothing but the mere form of thought.", "2.", "As pure logic, it has no empirical principles, and consequently draws nothing (contrary to the common persuasion) from psychology, which therefore has no influence on the canon of the understanding.", "It is a demonstrated doctrine, and everything in it must be certain completely Ã  priori.", "What I called applied logic (contrary to the common acceptation of this term, according to which it should contain certain exercises for the scholar, for which pure logic gives the rules), is a representation of the understanding, and of the rules of its necessary employment in concreto, that is to say, under the accidental conditions of the subject, which may either hinder or promote this employment, and which are all given only empirically.", "Thus applied logic treats of attention, its impediments and consequences, of the origin of error, of the state of doubt, hesitation, conviction, etc., and to it is related pure general logic in the same way that pure morality, which contains only the necessary moral laws of a free will, is related to practical ethics, which considers these laws under all the impediments of feelings, inclinations, and passions to which men are more or less subjected, and which never can furnish us with a true and demonstrated science, because it, as well as applied logic, requires empirical and psychological principles.", "II.", "Of Transcendental Logic.", "General logic, as we have seen, makes abstraction of all content of cognition, that is, of all relation of cognition to its object, and regards only the logical form in the relation of cognitions to each other, that is, the form of thought in general.", "But as we have both pure and empirical intuitions (as transcendental Ã¦sthetic proves), in like manner a distinction might be drawn between pure and empirical thought (of objects).", "In this case, there would exist a kind of logic, in which we should not make abstraction of all content of cognition; for or logic which should comprise merely the laws of pure thought (of an object), would of course exclude all those cognitions which were of empirical content.", "This kind of logic would also examine the origin of our cognitions of objects, so far as that origin cannot be ascribed to the objects themselves; while, on the contrary, general logic has nothing to do with the origin of our cognitions, but contemplates our representations, be they given primitively Ã  priori in ourselves, or be they only of empirical origin, solely according to the laws which the understanding observes in employing them in the process of thought, in relation to each other.", "Consequently, general logic treats of the form of the understanding only, which can be applied to representations, from whatever source they may have arisen.", "And here I shall make a remark, which the reader must bear well in mind in the course of the following considerations, to wit, that not every cognition Ã  priori, but only those through which we cognize that and how certain representations (intuitions or conceptions) are applied or are possible only Ã  priori; that is to say, the Ã  priori possibility of cognition and the Ã  priori use of it are transcendental.", "Therefore neither is space, nor any Ã  priori geometrical determination of space, a transcendental Representation, but only the knowledge that such a representation is not of empirical origin, and the possibility of its relating to objects of experience, although itself Ã  priori, can be called transcendental.", "So also, the application of space to objects in general would be transcendental; but if it be limited to objects of sense it is empirical.", "Thus, the distinction of the transcendental and empirical belongs only to the critique of cognitions, and does not concern the relation of these to their object.", "Accordingly, in the expectation that there may perhaps be conceptions which relate Ã  priori to objects, not as pure or sensuous intuitions, but merely as acts of pure thought (which are therefore conceptions, but neither of empirical nor Ã¦sthetical origin)â€in this expectation, I say, we form to ourselves, by anticipation, the idea of a science of pure understanding and rational cognition, by means of which we may cogitate objects entirely Ã  priori.", "A science of this kind, which should determine the origin, the extent, and the objective validity of such cognitions, must be called transcendental logic, because it has not, like general logic, to do with the laws of understanding and reason in relation to empirical as well as pure rational cognitions without distinction, but concerns itself with these only in an Ã  priori relation to objects.", "III.", "Of the Division of General Logic into Analytic and Dialectic.", "The old question with which people sought to push logicians into a corner, so that they must either have recourse to pitiful sophisms or confess their ignorance, and consequently the vanity of their whole art, is this  â€œWhat is truth?â€ The definition of the word truth, to wit, â€œthe accordance of the cognition with its object,â€ is presupposed in the question; but we desire to be told, in the answer to it, what is the universal and secure criterion of the truth of every cognition.", "To know what questions we may reasonably propose is in itself a strong evidence of sagacity and intelligence.", "For if a question be in itself absurd and unsusceptible of a rational answer, it is attended with the dangerâ€not to mention the shame that falls upon the person who proposes itâ€of seducing the unguarded listener into making absurd answers, and we are presented with the ridiculous spectacle of one (as the ancients said) â€œmilking the he goat, and the other holding a sieve.â€  If truth consists in the accordance of a cognition with its object, this object must be, ipso facto, distinguished from all others; for a cognition is false if it does not accord with the object to which it relates, although it contains something which may be affirmed of other objects.", "Now an universal criterion of truth would be that which is valid for all cognitions, without distinction of their objects.", "But it is evident that since, in the case of such a criterion, we make abstraction of all the content of a cognition (that is, of all relation to its object), and truth relates precisely to this content, it must be utterly absurd to ask for a mark of the truth of this content of cognition; and that, accordingly, a sufficient, and at the same time universal, test of truth cannot possibly be found.", "As we have already termed the content of a cognition its matter, we shall say  â€œOf the truth of our cognitions in respect of their matter, no universal test can be demanded, because such a demand is self contradictory.â€  On the other hand, with regard to our cognition in respect of its mere form (excluding all content), it is equally manifest that logic, in so far as it exhibits the universal and necessary laws of the understanding, must in these very laws present us with criteria of truth.", "Whatever contradicts these rules is false, because thereby the understanding is made to contradict its own universal laws of thought; that is, to contradict itself.", "These criteria, however, apply solely to the form of truth, that is, of thought in general, and in so far they are perfectly accurate, yet not sufficient.", "For although a cognition may be perfectly accurate as to logical form, that is, not self contradictory, it is notwithstanding quite possible that it may not stand in agreement with its object.", "Consequently, the merely logical criterion of truth, namely, the accordance of a cognition with the universal and formal laws of understanding and reason, is nothing more than the conditio sine qua non, or negative condition of all truth.", "Farther than this logic cannot go, and the error which depends not on the form, but on the content of the cognition, it has no test to discover.", "General logic, then, resolves the whole formal business of understanding and reason into its elements, and exhibits them as principles of all logical judging of our cognitions.", "This part of logic may, therefore, be called analytic, and is at least the negative test of truth, because all cognitions must first of an be estimated and tried according to these laws before we proceed to investigate them in respect of their content, in order to discover whether they contain positive truth in regard to their object.", "Because, however, the mere form of a cognition, accurately as it may accord with logical laws, is insufficient to supply us with material (objective) truth, no one, by means of logic alone, can venture to predicate anything of or decide concerning objects, unless he has obtained, independently of logic, well grounded information about them, in order afterwards to examine, according to logical laws, into the use and connection, in a cohering whole, of that information, or, what is still better, merely to test it by them.", "Notwithstanding, there lies so seductive a charm in the possession of a specious art like thisâ€an art which gives to all our cognitions the form of the understanding, although with respect to the content thereof we may be sadly deficientâ€that general logic, which is merely a canon of judgement, has been employed as an organon for the actual production, or rather for the semblance of production, of objective assertions, and has thus been grossly misapplied.", "Now general logic, in its assumed character of organon, is called dialectic.", "Different as are the significations in which the ancients used this term for a science or an art, we may safely infer, from their actual employment of it, that with them it was nothing else than a logic of illusionâ€a sophistical art for giving ignorance, nay, even intentional sophistries, the colouring of truth, in which the thoroughness of procedure which logic requires was imitated, and their topic employed to cloak the empty pretensions.", "Now it may be taken as a safe and useful warning, that general logic, considered as an organon, must always be a logic of illusion, that is, be dialectical, for, as it teaches us nothing whatever respecting the content of our cognitions, but merely the formal conditions of their accordance with the understanding, which do not relate to and are quite indifferent in respect of objects, any attempt to employ it as an instrument (organon) in order to extend and enlarge the range of our knowledge must end in mere prating; any one being able to maintain or oppose, with some appearance of truth, any single assertion whatever.", "Such instruction is quite unbecoming the dignity of philosophy.", "For these reasons we have chosen to denominate this part of logic dialectic, in the sense of a critique of dialectical illusion, and we wish the term to be so understood in this place.", "IV.", "Of the Division of Transcendental Logic into Transcendental Analytic and Dialectic.", "In transcendental logic we isolate the understanding (as in transcendental Ã¦sthetic the sensibility) and select from our cognition merely that part of thought which has its origin in the understanding alone.", "The exercise of this pure cognition, however, depends upon this as its condition, that objects to which it may be applied be given to us in intuition, for without intuition the whole of our cognition is without objects, and is therefore quite void.", "That part of transcendental logic, then, which treats of the elements of pure cognition of the understanding, and of the principles without which no object at all can be thought, is transcendental analytic, and at the same time a logic of truth.", "For no cognition can contradict it, without losing at the same time all content, that is, losing all reference to an object, and therefore all truth.", "But because we are very easily seduced into employing these pure cognitions and principles of the understanding by themselves, and that even beyond the boundaries of experience, which yet is the only source whence we can obtain matter (objects) on which those pure conceptions may be employedâ€understanding runs the risk of making, by means of empty sophisms, a material and objective use of the mere formal principles of the pure understanding, and of passing judgements on objects without distinctionâ€objects which are not given to us, nay, perhaps cannot be given to us in any way.", "Now, as it ought properly to be only a canon for judging of the empirical use of the understanding, this kind of logic is misused when we seek to employ it as an organon of the universal and unlimited exercise of the understanding, and attempt with the pure understanding alone to judge synthetically, affirm, and determine respecting objects in general.", "In this case the exercise of the pure understanding becomes dialectical.", "The second part of our transcendental logic must therefore be a critique of dialectical illusion, and this critique we shall term transcendental dialecticâ€not meaning it as an art of producing dogmatically such illusion (an art which is unfortunately too current among the practitioners of metaphysical juggling), but as a critique of understanding and reason in regard to their hyperphysical use.", "This critique will expose the groundless nature of the pretensions of these two faculties, and invalidate their claims to the discovery and enlargement of our cognitions merely by means of transcendental principles, and show that the proper employment of these faculties is to test the judgements made by the pure understanding, and to guard it from sophistical delusion.", "FIRST DIVISION.", "TRANSCENDENTAL LOGIC.", "TRANSCENDENTAL ANALYTIC.", "Â§ 1  Transcendental analytic is the dissection of the whole of our Ã  priori knowledge into the elements of the pure cognition of the understanding.", "In order to effect our purpose, it is necessary  (1) That the conceptions be pure and not empirical;

limitation is merely reality conjoined with negation; community is the causality of a substance, reciprocally determining, and determined by other substances; and finally, necessity is nothing but existence, which is given through the possibility itself.", "Let it not be supposed, however, that the third category is merely a deduced, and not a primitive conception of the pure understanding.", "For the conjunction of the first and second, in order to produce the third conception, requires a particular function of the understanding, which is by no means identical with those which are exercised in the first and second.", "Thus, the conception of a number (which belongs to the category of totality) is not always possible, where the conceptions of multitude and unity exist (for example, in the representation of the infinite).", "Or, if I conjoin the conception of a cause with that of a substance, it does not follow that the conception of influence, that is, how one substance can be the cause of something in another substance, will be understood from that.", "Thus it is evident that a particular act of the understanding is here necessary; and so in the other instances.", "III.", "With respect to one category, namely, that of community, which is found in the third class, it is not so easy as with the others to detect its accordance with the form of the disjunctive judgement which corresponds to it in the table of the logical functions.", "In order to assure ourselves of this accordance, we must observe that in every disjunctive judgement, the sphere of the judgement (that is, the complex of all that is contained in it) is represented as a whole divided into parts; and, since one part cannot be contained in the other, they are cogitated as co ordinated with, not subordinated to each other, so that they do not determine each other unilaterally, as in a linear series, but reciprocally, as in an aggregateâ€(if one member of the division is posited, all the rest are excluded; and conversely).", "Now a like connection is cogitated in a whole of things; for one thing is not subordinated, as effect, to another as cause of its existence, but, on the contrary, is co ordinated contemporaneously and reciprocally, as a cause in relation to the determination of the others (for example, in a bodyâ€the parts of which mutually attract and repel each other).", "And this is an entirely different kind of connection from that which we find in the mere relation of the cause to the effect (the principle to the consequence), for in such a connection the consequence does not in its turn determine the principle, and therefore does not constitute, with the latter, a wholeâ€just as the Creator does not with the world make up a whole.", "The process of understanding by which it represents to itself the sphere of a divided conception, is employed also when we think of a thing as divisible; and in the same manner as the members of the division in the former exclude one another, and yet are connected in one sphere, so the understanding represents to itself the parts of the latter, as havingâ€each of themâ€an existence (as substances), independently of the others, and yet as united in one whole.", "Â§ 8   In the transcendental philosophy of the ancients there exists one more leading division, which contains pure conceptions of the understanding, and which, although not numbered among the categories, ought, according to them, as conceptions Ã  priori, to be valid of objects.", "But in this case they would augment the number of the categories; which cannot be.", "These are set forth in the proposition, so renowned among the schoolmenâ€â€˜_Quodlibet ens est UNUM, VERUM, BONUM_.â€™ Now, though the inferences from this principle were mere tautological propositions, and though it is allowed only by courtesy to retain a place in modern metaphysics, yet a thought which maintained itself for such a length of time, however empty it seems to be, deserves an investigation of its origin, and justifies the conjecture that it must be grounded in some law of the understanding, which, as is often the case, has only been erroneously interpreted.", "These pretended transcendental predicates are, in fact, nothing but logical requisites and criteria of all cognition of objects, and they employ, as the basis for this cognition, the categories of quantity, namely, unity, plurality, and totality.", "But these, which must be taken as material conditions, that is, as belonging to the possibility of things themselves, they employed merely in a formal signification, as belonging to the logical requisites of all cognition, and yet most unguardedly changed these criteria of thought into properties of objects, as things in themselves.", "Now, in every cognition of an object, there is unity of conception, which may be called qualitative unity, so far as by this term we understand only the unity in our connection of the manifold; for example, unity of the theme in a play, an oration, or a story.", "Secondly, there is truth in respect of the deductions from it.", "The more true deductions we have from a given conception, the more criteria of its objective reality.", "This we might call the qualitative plurality of characteristic marks, which belong to a conception as to a common foundation, but are not cogitated as a quantity in it.", "Thirdly, there is perfectionâ€which consists in this, that the plurality falls back upon the unity of the conception, and accords completely with that conception and with no other.", "This we may denominate qualitative completeness.", "Hence it is evident that these logical criteria of the possibility of cognition are merely the three categories of quantity modified and transformed to suit an unauthorized manner of applying them.", "That is to say, the three categories, in which the unity in the production of the quantum must be homogeneous throughout, are transformed solely with a view to the connection of heterogeneous parts of cognition in one act of consciousness, by means of the quality of the cognition, which is the principle of that connection.", "Thus the criterion of the possibility of a conception (not of its object) is the definition of it, in which the unity of the conception, the truth of all that may be immediately deduced from it, and finally, the completeness of what has been thus deduced, constitute the requisites for the reproduction of the whole conception.", "Thus also, the criterion or test of an hypothesis is the intelligibility of the received principle of explanation, or its unity (without help from any subsidiary hypothesis)â€the truth of our deductions from it (consistency with each other and with experience)â€and lastly, the completeness of the principle of the explanation of these deductions, which refer to neither more nor less than what was admitted in the hypothesis, restoring analytically and Ã  posteriori, what was cogitated synthetically and Ã  priori.", "By the conceptions, therefore, of unity, truth, and perfection, we have made no addition to the transcendental table of the categories, which is complete without them.", "We have, on the contrary, merely employed the three categories of quantity, setting aside their application to objects of experience, as general logical laws of the consistency of cognition with itself.", "Chapter II.", "Of the Deduction of the Pure Conceptions of the Understanding  Section I.

and consider ourselves, even without any attempt at deduction, justified in attaching to them a sense, and a supposititious signification, because we have always experience at hand to demonstrate their objective reality.", "There exist also, however, usurped conceptions, such as fortune, fate, which circulate with almost universal indulgence, and yet are occasionally challenged by the question, â€œquid juris?â€ In such cases, we have great difficulty in discovering any deduction for these terms, inasmuch as we cannot produce any manifest ground of right, either from experience or from reason, on which the claim to employ them can be founded.", "Among the many conceptions, which make up the very variegated web of human cognition, some are destined for pure use Ã  priori, independent of all experience; and their title to be so employed always requires a deduction, inasmuch as, to justify such use of them, proofs from experience are not sufficient; but it is necessary to know how these conceptions can apply to objects without being derived from experience.", "I term, therefore, an examination of the manner in which conceptions can apply Ã  priori to objects, the transcendental deduction of conceptions, and I distinguish it from the empirical deduction, which indicates the mode in which conception is obtained through experience and reflection thereon; consequently, does not concern itself with the right, but only with the fact of our obtaining conceptions in such and such a manner.", "We have already seen that we are in possession of two perfectly different kinds of conceptions, which nevertheless agree with each other in this, that they both apply to objects completely Ã  priori.", "These are the conceptions of space and time as forms of sensibility, and the categories as pure conceptions of the understanding.", "To attempt an empirical deduction of either of these classes would be labour in vain, because the distinguishing characteristic of their nature consists in this, that they apply to their objects, without having borrowed anything from experience towards the representation of them.", "Consequently, if a deduction of these conceptions is necessary, it must always be transcendental.", "Meanwhile, with respect to these conceptions, as with respect to all our cognition, we certainly may discover in experience, if not the principle of their possibility, yet the occasioning causes of their production.", "It will be found that the impressions of sense give the first occasion for bringing into action the whole faculty of cognition, and for the production of experience, which contains two very dissimilar elements, namely, a matter for cognition, given by the senses, and a certain form for the arrangement of this matter, arising out of the inner fountain of pure intuition and thought; and these, on occasion given by sensuous impressions, are called into exercise and produce conceptions.", "Such an investigation into the first efforts of our faculty of cognition to mount from particular perceptions to general conceptions is undoubtedly of great utility; and we have to thank the celebrated Locke for having first opened the way for this inquiry.", "But a deduction of the pure Ã  priori conceptions of course never can be made in this way, seeing that, in regard to their future employment, which must be entirely independent of experience, they must have a far different certificate of birth to show from that of a descent from experience.", "This attempted physiological derivation, which cannot properly be called deduction, because it relates merely to a quaestio facti, I shall entitle an explanation of the possession of a pure cognition.", "It is therefore manifest that there can only be a transcendental deduction of these conceptions and by no means an empirical one; also, that all attempts at an empirical deduction, in regard to pure Ã  priori conceptions, are vain, and can only be made by one who does not understand the altogether peculiar nature of these cognitions.", "But although it is admitted that the only possible deduction of pure Ã  priori cognition is a transcendental deduction, it is not, for that reason, perfectly manifest that such a deduction is absolutely necessary.", "We have already traced to their sources the conceptions of space and time, by means of a transcendental deduction, and we have explained and determined their objective validity Ã  priori.", "Geometry, nevertheless, advances steadily and securely in the province of pure Ã  priori cognitions, without needing to ask from philosophy any certificate as to the pure and legitimate origin of its fundamental conception of space.", "But the use of the conception in this science extends only to the external world of sense, the pure form of the intuition of which is space; and in this world, therefore, all geometrical cognition, because it is founded upon Ã  priori intuition, possesses immediate evidence, and the objects of this cognition are given Ã  priori (as regards their form) in intuition by and through the cognition itself.", "With the pure conceptions of understanding, on the contrary, commences the absolute necessity of seeking a transcendental deduction, not only of these conceptions themselves, but likewise of space, because, inasmuch as they make affirmations concerning objects not by means of the predicates of intuition and sensibility, but of pure thought Ã  priori, they apply to objects without any of the conditions of sensibility.", "Besides, not being founded on experience, they are not presented with any object in Ã  priori intuition upon which, antecedently to experience, they might base their synthesis.", "Hence results, not only doubt as to the objective validity and proper limits of their use, but that even our conception of space is rendered equivocal; inasmuch as we are very ready with the aid of the categories, to carry the use of this conception beyond the conditions of sensuous intuitionâ€and, for this reason, we have already found a transcendental deduction of it needful.", "The reader, then, must be quite convinced of the absolute necessity of a transcendental deduction, before taking a single step in the field of pure reason; because otherwise he goes to work blindly, and after he has wondered about in all directions, returns to the state of utter ignorance from which he started.", "He ought, moreover, clearly to recognize beforehand the unavoidable difficulties in his undertaking, so that he may not afterwards complain of the obscurity in which the subject itself is deeply involved, or become too soon impatient of the obstacles in his path; because we have a choice of only two thingsâ€either at once to give up all pretensions to knowledge beyond the limits of possible experience, or to bring this critical investigation to completion.", "We have been able, with very little trouble, to make it comprehensible how the conceptions of space and time, although Ã  priori cognitions, must necessarily apply to external objects, and render a synthetical cognition of these possible, independently of all experience.", "For inasmuch as only by means of such pure form of sensibility an object can appear to us, that is, be an object of empirical intuition, space and time are pure intuitions, which contain Ã  priori the condition of the possibility of objects as phenomena, and an Ã  priori synthesis in these intuitions possesses objective validity.", "On the other hand, the categories of the understanding do not represent the conditions under which objects are given to us in intuition; objects can consequently appear to us without necessarily connecting themselves with these, and consequently without any necessity binding on the understanding to contain Ã  priori the conditions of these objects.", "Thus we find ourselves involved in a difficulty which did not present itself in the sphere of sensibility, that is to say, we cannot discover how the subjective conditions of thought can have objective validity, in other words, can become conditions of the possibility of all cognition of objects; for phenomena may certainly be given to us in intuition without any help from the functions of the understanding.", "Let us take, for example, the conception of cause, which indicates a peculiar kind of synthesis, namely, that with something, A, something entirely different, B, is connected according to a law.", "It is not Ã  priori manifest why phenomena should contain anything of this kind (we are of course debarred from appealing for proof to experience, for the objective validity of this conception must be demonstrated Ã  priori), and it hence remains doubtful Ã  priori, whether such a conception be not quite void and without any corresponding object among phenomena.", "For that objects of sensuous intuition must correspond to the formal conditions of sensibility existing Ã  priori in the mind is quite evident, from the fact that without these they could not be objects for us; but that they must also correspond to the conditions which understanding requires for the synthetical unity of thought is an assertion, the grounds for which are not so easily to be discovered.", "For phenomena might be so constituted as not to correspond to the conditions of the unity of thought; and all things might lie in such confusion that, for example, nothing could be met with in the sphere of phenomena to suggest a law of synthesis, and so correspond to the conception of cause and effect; so that this conception would be quite void, null, and without significance.", "Phenomena would nevertheless continue to present objects to our intuition; for mere intuition does not in any respect stand in need of the functions of thought.", "If we thought to free ourselves from the labour of these investigations by saying  â€œExperience is constantly offering us examples of the relation of cause and effect in phenomena, and presents us with abundant opportunity of abstracting the conception of cause, and so at the same time of corroborating the objective validity of this conceptionâ€; we should in this case be overlooking the fact, that the conception of cause cannot arise in this way at all; that, on the contrary, it must either have an Ã  priori basis in the understanding, or be rejected as a mere chimera.", "For this conception demands that something, A, should be of such a nature that something else, B, should follow from it necessarily, and according to an absolutely universal law.", "We may certainly collect from phenomena a law, according to which this or that usually happens, but the element of necessity is not to be found in it.", "Hence it is evident that to the synthesis of cause and effect belongs a dignity, which is utterly wanting in any empirical synthesis; for it is no mere mechanical synthesis, by means of addition, but a dynamical one; that is to say, the effect is not to be cogitated as merely annexed to the cause, but as posited by and through the cause, and resulting from it.", "The strict universality of this law never can be a characteristic of empirical laws, which obtain through induction only a comparative universality, that is, an extended range of practical application.", "But the pure conceptions of the understanding would entirely lose all their peculiar character, if we treated them merely as the productions of experience.", "Transition to the Transcendental Deduction of the Categories Â§ 10  There are only two possible ways in which synthetical representation and its objects can coincide with and relate necessarily to each other, and, as it were, meet together.", "Either the object alone makes the representation possible, or the representation alone makes the object possible.", "In the former case, the relation between them is only empirical, and an Ã  priori representation is impossible.", "And this is the case with phenomena, as regards that in them which is referable to mere sensation.", "In the latter caseâ€although representation alone (for of its causality, by means of the will, we do not here speak) does not produce the object as to its existence, it must nevertheless be Ã  priori determinative in regard to the object, if it is only by means of the representation that we can cognize anything as an object.", "Now there are only two conditions of the possibility of a cognition of objects; firstly, intuition, by means of which the object, though only as phenomenon, is given; secondly, conception, by means of which the object which corresponds to this intuition is thought.", "But it is evident from what has been said on Ã¦sthetic that the first condition, under which alone objects can be intuited, must in fact exist, as a formal basis for them, Ã  priori in the mind.", "With this formal condition of sensibility, therefore, all phenomena necessarily correspond, because it is only through it that they can be phenomena at all; that is, can be empirically intuited and given.", "Now the question is whether there do not exist, Ã  priori in the mind, conceptions of understanding also, as conditions under which alone something, if not intuited, is yet thought as object.", "If this question be answered in the affirmative, it follows that all empirical cognition of objects is necessarily conformable to such conceptions, since, if they are not presupposed, it is impossible that anything can be an object of experience.", "Now all experience contains, besides the intuition of the senses through which an object is given, a conception also of an object that is given in intuition.", "Accordingly, conceptions of objects in general must lie as Ã  priori conditions at the foundation of all empirical cognition; and consequently, the objective validity of the categories, as Ã  priori conceptions, will rest upon this, that experience (as far as regards the form of thought) is possible only by their means.", "For in that case they apply necessarily and Ã  priori to objects of experience, because only through them can an object of experience be thought.", "The whole aim of the transcendental deduction of all Ã  priori conceptions is to show that these conceptions are Ã  priori conditions of the possibility of all experience.", "Conceptions which afford us the objective foundation of the possibility of experience are for that very reason necessary.", "But the analysis of the experiences in which they are met with is not deduction, but only an illustration of them, because from experience they could never derive the attribute of necessity.", "Without their original applicability and relation to all possible experience, in which all objects of cognition present themselves, the relation of the categories to objects, of whatever nature, would be quite incomprehensible.", "The celebrated Locke, for want of due reflection on these points, and because he met with pure conceptions of the understanding in experience, sought also to deduce them from experience, and yet proceeded so inconsequently as to attempt, with their aid, to arrive it cognitions which lie far beyond the limits of all experience.", "David Hume perceived that, to render this possible, it was necessary that the conceptions should have an Ã  priori origin.", "But as he could not explain how it was possible that conceptions which are not connected with each other in the understanding must nevertheless be thought as necessarily connected in the objectâ€and it never occurred to him that the understanding itself might, perhaps, by means of these conceptions, be the author of the experience in which its objects were presented to itâ€he was forced to drive these conceptions from experience, that is, from a subjective necessity arising from repeated association of experiences erroneously considered to be objectiveâ€in one word, from habit.", "But he proceeded with perfect consequence and declared it to be impossible, with such conceptions and the principles arising from them, to overstep the limits of experience.", "The empirical derivation, however, which both of these philosophers attributed to these conceptions, cannot possibly be reconciled with the fact that we do possess scientific Ã  priori cognitions, namely, those of pure mathematics and general physics.", "The former of these two celebrated men opened a wide door to extravaganceâ€(for if reason has once undoubted right on its side, it will not allow itself to be confined to set limits, by vague recommendations of moderation); the latter gave himself up entirely to scepticismâ€a natural consequence, after having discovered, as he thought, that the faculty of cognition was not trustworthy.", "We now intend to make a trial whether it be not possible safely to conduct reason between these two rocks, to assign her determinate limits, and yet leave open for her the entire sphere of her legitimate activity.", "I shall merely premise an explanation of what the categories are.", "They are conceptions of an object in general, by means of which its intuition is contemplated as determined in relation to one of the logical functions of judgement.", "The following will make this plain.", "The function of the categorical judgement is that of the relation of subject to predicate;

for example, that it is not extended, or in space; that its duration is not time; that in it no change (the effect of the determinations in time) is to be met with, and so on.", "But it is no proper knowledge if I merely indicate what the intuition of the object is not, without being able to say what is contained in it, for I have not shown the possibility of an object to which my pure conception of understanding could be applicable, because I have not been able to furnish any intuition corresponding to it, but am only able to say that our intuition is not valid for it.", "But the most important point is this, that to a something of this kind not one category can be found applicable.", "Take, for example, the conception of substance, that is, something that can exist as subject, but never as mere predicate; in regard to this conception I am quite ignorant whether there can really be anything to correspond to such a determination of thought, if empirical intuition did not afford me the occasion for its application.", "But of this more in the sequel.", "Of the Application of the Categories to Objects of the Senses in general Â§ 20  The pure conceptions of the understanding apply to objects of intuition in general, through the understanding alone, whether the intuition be our own or some other, provided only it be sensuous, but are, for this very reason, mere forms of thought, by means of which alone no determined object can be cognized.", "The synthesis or conjunction of the manifold in these conceptions relates, we have said, only to the unity of apperception, and is for this reason the ground of the possibility of Ã  priori cognition, in so far as this cognition is dependent on the understanding.", "This synthesis is, therefore, not merely transcendental, but also purely intellectual.", "But because a certain form of sensuous intuition exists in the mind Ã  priori which rests on the receptivity of the representative faculty (sensibility), the understanding, as a spontaneity, is able to determine the internal sense by means of the diversity of given representations, conformably to the synthetical unity of apperception, and thus to cogitate the synthetical unity of the apperception of the manifold of sensuous intuition Ã  priori, as the condition to which must necessarily be submitted all objects of human intuition.", "And in this manner the categories as mere forms of thought receive objective reality, that is, application to objects which are given to us in intuition, but that only as phenomena, for it is only of phenomena that we are capable of Ã  priori intuition.", "This synthesis of the manifold of sensuous intuition, which is possible and necessary Ã  priori, may be called figurative (synthesis speciosa), in contradistinction to that which is cogitated in the mere category in regard to the manifold of an intuition in general, and is called connection or conjunction of the understanding (synthesis intellectualis).", "Both are transcendental, not merely because they themselves precede Ã  priori all experience, but also because they form the basis for the possibility of other cognition Ã  priori.", "But the figurative synthesis, when it has relation only to the originally synthetical unity of apperception, that is to the transcendental unity cogitated in the categories, must, to be distinguished from the purely intellectual conjunction, be entitled the transcendental synthesis of imagination.", "Imagination is the faculty of representing an object even without its presence in intuition.", "Now, as all our intuition is sensuous, imagination, by reason of the subjective condition under which alone it can give a corresponding intuition to the conceptions of the understanding, belongs to sensibility.", "But in so far as the synthesis of the imagination is an act of spontaneity, which is determinative, and not, like sense, merely determinable, and which is consequently able to determine sense Ã  priori, according to its form, conformably to the unity of apperception, in so far is the imagination a faculty of determining sensibility Ã  priori, and its synthesis of intuitions according to the categories must be the transcendental synthesis of the imagination.", "It is an operation of the understanding on sensibility, and the first application of the understanding to objects of possible intuition, and at the same time the basis for the exercise of the other functions of that faculty.", "As figurative, it is distinguished from the merely intellectual synthesis, which is produced by the understanding alone, without the aid of imagination.", "Now, in so far as imagination is spontaneity, I sometimes call it also the productive imagination, and distinguish it from the reproductive, the synthesis of which is subject entirely to empirical laws, those of association, namely, and which, therefore, contributes nothing to the explanation of the possibility of Ã  priori cognition, and for this reason belongs not to transcendental philosophy, but to psychology.", "We have now arrived at the proper place for explaining the paradox which must have struck every one in our exposition of the internal sense (Â§ 6), namelyâ€how this sense represents us to our own consciousness, only as we appear to ourselves, not as we are in ourselves, because, to wit, we intuite ourselves only as we are inwardly affected.", "Now this appears to be contradictory, inasmuch as we thus stand in a passive relation to ourselves; and therefore in the systems of psychology, the internal sense is commonly held to be one with the faculty of apperception, while we, on the contrary, carefully distinguish them.", "That which determines the internal sense is the understanding, and its original power of conjoining the manifold of intuition, that is, of bringing this under an apperception (upon which rests the possibility of the understanding itself).", "Now, as the human understanding is not in itself a faculty of intuition, and is unable to exercise such a power, in order to conjoin, as it were, the manifold of its own intuition, the synthesis of understanding is, considered per se, nothing but the unity of action, of which, as such, it is self conscious, even apart from sensibility, by which, moreover, it is able to determine our internal sense in respect of the manifold which may be presented to it according to the form of sensuous intuition.", "Thus, under the name of a transcendental synthesis of imagination, the understanding exercises an activity upon the passive subject, whose faculty it is; and so we are right in saying that the internal sense is affected thereby.", "Apperception and its synthetical unity are by no means one and the same with the internal sense.", "The former, as the source of all our synthetical conjunction, applies, under the name of the categories, to the manifold of intuition in general, prior to all sensuous intuition of objects.", "The internal sense, on the contrary, contains merely the form of intuition, but without any synthetical conjunction of the manifold therein, and consequently does not contain any determined intuition, which is possible only through consciousness of the determination of the manifold by the transcendental act of the imagination (synthetical influence of the understanding on the internal sense), which I have named figurative synthesis.", "This we can indeed always perceive in ourselves.", "We cannot cogitate a geometrical line without drawing it in thought, nor a circle without describing it, nor represent the three dimensions of space without drawing three lines from the same point perpendicular to one another.", "We cannot even cogitate time, unless, in drawing a straight line (which is to serve as the external figurative representation of time), we fix our attention on the act of the synthesis of the manifold, whereby we determine successively the internal sense, and thus attend also to the succession of this determination.", "Motion as an act of the subject (not as a determination of an object),[20] consequently the synthesis of the manifold in space, if we make abstraction of space and attend merely to the act by which we determine the internal sense according to its form, is that which produces the conception of succession.", "The understanding, therefore, does by no means find in the internal sense any such synthesis of the manifold, but produces it, in that it affects this sense.", "At the same time, how â€œI who thinkâ€ is distinct from the â€œiâ€ which intuites itself (other modes of intuition being cogitable as at least possible), and yet one and the same with this latter as the same subject;

Of the Schematism at of the Pure Conceptions of the Understanding  In all subsumptions of an object under a conception, the representation of the object must be homogeneous with the conception; in other words, the conception must contain that which is represented in the object to be subsumed under it.", "For this is the meaning of the expression  â€œAn object is contained under a conception.â€ Thus the empirical conception of a plate is homogeneous with the pure geometrical conception of a circle, inasmuch as the roundness which is cogitated in the former is intuited in the latter.", "But pure conceptions of the understanding, when compared with empirical intuitions, or even with sensuous intuitions in general, are quite heterogeneous, and never can be discovered in any intuition.", "How then is the subsumption of the latter under the former, and consequently the application of the categories to phenomena, possible?â€For it is impossible to say, for example  â€œCausality can be intuited through the senses and is contained in the phenomenon.â€â€This natural and important question forms the real cause of the necessity of a transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgement, with the purpose, to wit, of showing how pure conceptions of the understanding can be applied to phenomena.", "In all other sciences, where the conceptions by which the object is thought in the general are not so different and heterogeneous from those which represent the object in concretoâ€as it is given, it is quite unnecessary to institute any special inquiries concerning the application of the former to the latter.", "Now it is quite clear that there must be some third thing, which on the one side is homogeneous with the category, and with the phenomenon on the other, and so makes the application of the former to the latter possible.", "This mediating representation must be pure (without any empirical content), and yet must on the one side be intellectual, on the other sensuous.", "Such a representation is the transcendental schema.", "The conception of the understanding contains pure synthetical unity of the manifold in general.", "Time, as the formal condition of the manifold of the internal sense, consequently of the conjunction of all representations, contains Ã  priori a manifold in the pure intuition.", "Now a transcendental determination of time is so far homogeneous with the category, which constitutes the unity thereof, that it is universal and rests upon a rule Ã  priori.", "On the other hand, it is so far homogeneous with the phenomenon, inasmuch as time is contained in every empirical representation of the manifold.", "Thus an application of the category to phenomena becomes possible, by means of the transcendental determination of time, which, as the schema of the conceptions of the understanding, mediates the subsumption of the latter under the former.", "After what has been proved in our deduction of the categories, no one, it is to be hoped, can hesitate as to the proper decision of the question, whether the employment of these pure conceptions of the understanding ought to be merely empirical or also transcendental; in other words, whether the categories, as conditions of a possible experience, relate Ã  priori solely to phenomena, or whether, as conditions of the possibility of things in general, their application can be extended to objects as things in themselves.", "For we have there seen that conceptions are quite impossible, and utterly without signification, unless either to them, or at least to the elements of which they consist, an object be given; and that, consequently, they cannot possibly apply to objects as things in themselves without regard to the question whether and how these may be given to us; and, further, that the only manner in which objects can be given to us is by means of the modification of our sensibility; and, finally, that pure Ã  priori conceptions, in addition to the function of the understanding in the category, must contain Ã  priori formal conditions of sensibility (of the internal sense, namely), which again contain the general condition under which alone the category can be applied to any object.", "This formal and pure condition of sensibility, to which the conception of the understanding is restricted in its employment, we shall name the schema of the conception of the understanding, and the procedure of the understanding with these schemata we shall call the schematism of the pure understanding.", "The schema is, in itself, always a mere product of the imagination.", "But, as the synthesis of imagination has for its aim no single intuition, but merely unity in the determination of sensibility, the schema is clearly distinguishable from the image.", "Thus, if I place five points one after another.... this is an image of the number five.", "On the other hand, if I only think a number in general, which may be either five or a hundred, this thought is rather the representation of a method of representing in an image a sum (e.g., a thousand) in conformity with a conception, than the image itself, an image which I should find some little difficulty in reviewing, and comparing with the conception.", "Now this representation of a general procedure of the imagination to present its image to a conception, I call the schema of this conception.", "In truth, it is not images of objects, but schemata, which lie at the foundation of our pure sensuous conceptions.", "No image could ever be adequate to our conception of a triangle in general.", "For the generalness of the conception it never could attain to, as this includes under itself all triangles, whether right angled, acute angled, etc., whilst the image would always be limited to a single part of this sphere.", "The schema of the triangle can exist nowhere else than in thought, and it indicates a rule of the synthesis of the imagination in regard to pure figures in space.", "Still less is an object of experience, or an image of the object, ever to the empirical conception.", "On the contrary, the conception always relates immediately to the schema of the imagination, as a rule for the determination of our intuition, in conformity with a certain general conception.", "The conception of a dog indicates a rule, according to which my imagination can delineate the figure of a four footed animal in general, without being limited to any particular individual form which experience presents to me, or indeed to any possible image that I can represent to myself in concreto.", "This schematism of our understanding in regard to phenomena and their mere form, is an art, hidden in the depths of the human soul, whose true modes of action we shall only with difficulty discover and unveil.", "Thus much only can we say  â€œThe image is a product of the empirical faculty of the productive imaginationâ€the schema of sensuous conceptions (of figures in space, for example) is a product, and, as it were, a monogram of the pure imagination Ã  priori, whereby and according to which images first become possible, which, however, can be connected with the conception only mediately by means of the schema which they indicate, and are in themselves never fully adequate to it.â€ On the other hand, the schema of a pure conception of the understanding is something that cannot be reduced into any imageâ€it is nothing else than the pure synthesis expressed by the category, conformably, to a rule of unity according to conceptions.", "It is a transcendental product of the imagination, a product which concerns the determination of the internal sense, according to conditions of its form (time) in respect to all representations, in so far as these representations must be conjoined Ã  priori in one conception, conformably to the unity of apperception.", "Without entering upon a dry and tedious analysis of the essential requisites of transcendental schemata of the pure conceptions of the understanding, we shall rather proceed at once to give an explanation of them according to the order of the categories, and in connection therewith.", "For the external sense the pure image of all quantities (quantorum) is space; the pure image of all objects of sense in general, is time.", "But the pure schema of quantity (quantitatis) as a conception of the understanding, is number, a representation which comprehends the successive addition of one to one (homogeneous quantities).", "Thus, number is nothing else than the unity of the synthesis of the manifold in a homogeneous intuition, by means of my generating time itself in my apprehension of the intuition.", "Reality, in the pure conception of the understanding, is that which corresponds to a sensation in general; that, consequently, the conception of which indicates a being (in time).", "Negation is that the conception of which represents a not being (in time).", "The opposition of these two consists therefore in the difference of one and the same time, as a time filled or a time empty.", "Now as time is only the form of intuition, consequently of objects as phenomena, that which in objects corresponds to sensation is the transcendental matter of all objects as things in themselves (Sachheit, reality).", "Now every sensation has a degree or quantity by which it can fill time, that is to say, the internal sense in respect of the representation of an object, more or less, until it vanishes into nothing (= 0 = negatio).", "Thus there is a relation and connection between reality and negation, or rather a transition from the former to the latter, which makes every reality representable to us as a quantum; and the schema of a reality as the quantity of something in so far as it fills time, is exactly this continuous and uniform generation of the reality in time, as we descend in time from the sensation which has a certain degree, down to the vanishing thereof, or gradually ascend from negation to the quantity thereof.", "The schema of substance is the permanence of the real in time; that is, the representation of it as a substratum of the empirical determination of time; a substratum which therefore remains, whilst all else changes.", "(Time passes not, but in it passes the existence of the changeable.", "To time, therefore, which is itself unchangeable and permanent, corresponds that which in the phenomenon is unchangeable in existence, that is, substance, and it is only by it that the succession and coexistence of phenomena can be determined in regard to time.)", "The schema of cause and of the causality of a thing is the real which, when posited, is always followed by something else.", "It consists, therefore, in the succession of the manifold, in so far as that succession is subjected to a rule.", "The schema of community (reciprocity of action and reaction), or the reciprocal causality of substances in respect of their accidents, is the coexistence of the determinations of the one with those of the other, according to a general rule.", "The schema of possibility is the accordance of the synthesis of different representations with the conditions of time in general (as, for example, opposites cannot exist together at the same time in the same thing, but only after each other), and is therefore the determination of the representation of a thing at any time.", "The schema of reality is existence in a determined time.", "The schema of necessity is the existence of an object in all time.", "It is clear, from all this, that the schema of the category of quantity contains and represents the generation (synthesis) of time itself, in the successive apprehension of an object; the schema of quality the synthesis of sensation with the representation of time, or the filling up of time; the schema of relation the relation of perceptions to each other in all time (that is, according to a rule of the determination of time)  and finally, the schema of modality and its categories, time itself, as the correlative of the determination of an objectâ€whether it does belong to time, and how.", "The schemata, therefore, are nothing but Ã  priori determinations of time according to rules, and these, in regard to all possible objects, following the arrangement of the categories, relate to the series in time, the content in time, the order in time, and finally, to the complex or totality in time.", "Hence it is apparent that the schematism of the understanding, by means of the transcendental synthesis of the imagination, amounts to nothing else than the unity of the manifold of intuition in the internal sense, and thus indirectly to the unity of apperception, as a function corresponding to the internal sense (a receptivity).", "Thus, the schemata of the pure conceptions of the understanding are the true and only conditions whereby our understanding receives an application to objects, and consequently significance.", "Finally, therefore, the categories are only capable of empirical use, inasmuch as they serve merely to subject phenomena to the universal rules of synthesis, by means of an Ã  priori necessary unity (on account of the necessary union of all consciousness in one original apperception); and so to render them susceptible of a complete connection in one experience.", "But within this whole of possible experience lie all our cognitions, and in the universal relation to this experience consists transcendental truth, which antecedes all empirical truth, and renders the latter possible.", "It is, however, evident at first sight, that although the schemata of sensibility are the sole agents in realizing the categories, they do, nevertheless, also restrict them, that is, they limit the categories by conditions which lie beyond the sphere of understandingâ€namely, in sensibility.", "Hence the schema is properly only the phenomenon, or the sensuous conception of an object in harmony with the category.", "(Numerus est quantitas phaenomenonâ€sensatio realitas phaenomenon; constans et perdurabile rerum substantia phaenomenonâ€aeternitas, necessitas, phaenomena, etc.)", "Now, if we remove a restrictive condition, we thereby amplify, it appears, the formerly limited conception.", "In this way, the categories in their pure signification, free from all conditions of sensibility, ought to be valid of things as they are, and not, as the schemata represent them, merely as they appear; and consequently the categories must have a significance far more extended, and wholly independent of all schemata.", "In truth, there does always remain to the pure conceptions of the understanding, after abstracting every sensuous condition, a value and significance, which is, however, merely logical.", "But in this case, no object is given them, and therefore they have no meaning sufficient to afford us a conception of an object.", "The notion of substance, for example, if we leave out the sensuous determination of permanence, would mean nothing more than a something which can be cogitated as subject, without the possibility of becoming a predicate to anything else.", "Of this representation I can make nothing, inasmuch as it does not indicate to me what determinations the thing possesses which must thus be valid as premier subject.", "Consequently, the categories, without schemata are merely functions of the understanding for the production of conceptions, but do not represent any object.", "This significance they derive from sensibility, which at the same time realizes the understanding and restricts it.", "Chapter II.", "System of all Principles of the Pure Understanding  In the foregoing chapter we have merely considered the general conditions under which alone the transcendental faculty of judgement is justified in using the pure conceptions of the understanding for synthetical judgements.", "Our duty at present is to exhibit in systematic connection those judgements which the understanding really produces Ã  priori.", "For this purpose, our table of the categories will certainly afford us the natural and safe guidance.", "For it is precisely the categories whose application to possible experience must constitute all pure Ã  priori cognition of the understanding; and the relation of which to sensibility will, on that very account, present us with a complete and systematic catalogue of all the transcendental principles of the use of the understanding.", "Principles Ã  priori are so called, not merely because they contain in themselves the grounds of other judgements, but also because they themselves are not grounded in higher and more general cognitions.", "This peculiarity, however, does not raise them altogether above the need of a proof.", "For although there could be found no higher cognition, and therefore no objective proof, and although such a principle rather serves as the foundation for all cognition of the object, this by no means hinders us from drawing a proof from the subjective sources of the possibility of the cognition of an object.", "Such a proof is necessary, moreover, because without it the principle might be liable to the imputation of being a mere gratuitous assertion.", "In the second place, we shall limit our investigations to those principles which relate to the categories.", "For as to the principles of transcendental Ã¦sthetic, according to which space and time are the conditions of the possibility of things as phenomena, as also the restriction of these principles, namely, that they cannot be applied to objects as things in themselvesâ€these, of course, do not fall within the scope of our present inquiry.", "In like manner, the principles of mathematical science form no part of this system, because they are all drawn from intuition, and not from the pure conception of the understanding.", "The possibility of these principles, however, will necessarily be considered here, inasmuch as they are synthetical judgements Ã  priori, not indeed for the purpose of proving their accuracy and apodeictic certainty, which is unnecessary, but merely to render conceivable and deduce the possibility of such evident Ã  priori cognitions.", "But we shall have also to speak of the principle of analytical judgements, in opposition to synthetical judgements, which is the proper subject of our inquiries, because this very opposition will free the theory of the latter from all ambiguity, and place it clearly before our eyes in its true nature.", "SYSTEM OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING  Section I. Of the Supreme Principle of all Analytical Judgements  Whatever may be the content of our cognition, and in whatever manner our cognition may be related to its object, the universal, although only negative conditions of all our judgements is that they do not contradict themselves; otherwise these judgements are in themselves (even without respect to the object) nothing.", "But although there may exist no contradiction in our judgement, it may nevertheless connect conceptions in such a manner that they do not correspond to the object, or without any grounds either Ã  priori or Ã  posteriori for arriving at such a judgement, and thus, without being self contradictory, a judgement may nevertheless be either false or groundless.", "Now, the proposition  â€œNo subject can have a predicate that contradicts it,â€ is called the principle of contradiction, and is a universal but purely negative criterion of all truth.", "But it belongs to logic alone, because it is valid of cognitions, merely as cognitions and without respect to their content, and declares that the contradiction entirely nullifies them.", "We can also, however, make a positive use of this principle, that is, not merely to banish falsehood and error (in so far as it rests upon contradiction), but also for the cognition of truth.", "For if the judgement is analytical, be it affirmative or negative, its truth must always be recognizable by means of the principle of contradiction.", "For the contrary of that which lies and is cogitated as conception in the cognition of the object will be always properly negatived, but the conception itself must always be affirmed of the object, inasmuch as the contrary thereof would be in contradiction to the object.", "We must therefore hold the principle of contradiction to be the universal and fully sufficient Principle of all analytical cognition.", "But as a sufficient criterion of truth, it has no further utility or authority.", "For the fact that no cognition can be at variance with this principle without nullifying itself, constitutes this principle the sine qua non, but not the determining ground of the truth of our cognition.", "As our business at present is properly with the synthetical part of our knowledge only, we shall always be on our guard not to transgress this inviolable principle; but at the same time not to expect from it any direct assistance in the establishment of the truth of any synthetical proposition.", "There exists, however, a formula of this celebrated principleâ€a principle merely formal and entirely without contentâ€which contains a synthesis that has been inadvertently and quite unnecessarily mixed up with it.", "It is this  â€œIt is impossible for a thing to be and not to be at the same time.â€ Not to mention the superfluousness of the addition of the word impossible to indicate the apodeictic certainty, which ought to be self evident from the proposition itself, the proposition is affected by the condition of time, and as it were says  â€œA thing = A, which is something = B, cannot at the same time be non B.â€ But both, B as well as non B, may quite well exist in succession.", "For example, a man who is young cannot at the same time be old; but the same man can very well be at one time young, and at another not young, that is, old.", "Now the principle of contradiction as a merely logical proposition must not by any means limit its application merely to relations of time, and consequently a formula like the preceding is quite foreign to its true purpose.", "The misunderstanding arises in this way.", "We first of all separate a predicate of a thing from the conception of the thing, and afterwards connect with this predicate its opposite, and hence do not establish any contradiction with the subject, but only with its predicate, which has been conjoined with the subject syntheticallyâ€a contradiction, moreover, which obtains only when the first and second predicate are affirmed in the same time.", "If I say  â€œA man who is ignorant is not learned,â€ the condition â€œat the same timeâ€ must be added, for he who is at one time ignorant, may at another be learned.", "But if I say  â€œNo ignorant man is a learned man,â€ the proposition is analytical, because the characteristic ignorance is now a constituent part of the conception of the subject; and in this case the negative proposition is evident immediately from the proposition of contradiction, without the necessity of adding the condition â€œthe same time.â€ This is the reason why I have altered the formula of this principleâ€an alteration which shows very clearly the nature of an analytical proposition.", "Section II.", "Of the Supreme Principle of all Synthetical Judgements  The explanation of the possibility of synthetical judgements is a task with which general logic has nothing to do; indeed she needs not even be acquainted with its name.", "But in transcendental logic it is the most important matter to be dealt withâ€indeed the only one, if the question is of the possibility of synthetical judgements Ã  priori, the conditions and extent of their validity.", "For when this question is fully decided, it can reach its aim with perfect ease, the determination, to wit, of the extent and limits of the pure understanding.", "In an analytical judgement I do not go beyond the given conception, in order to arrive at some decision respecting it.", "If the judgement is affirmative, I predicate of the conception only that which was already cogitated in it; if negative, I merely exclude from the conception its contrary.", "But in synthetical judgements, I must go beyond the given conception, in order to cogitate, in relation with it, something quite different from that which was cogitated in it, a relation which is consequently never one either of identity or contradiction, and by means of which the truth or error of the judgement cannot be discerned merely from the judgement itself.", "Granted, then, that we must go out beyond a given conception, in order to compare it synthetically with another, a third thing is necessary, in which alone the synthesis of two conceptions can originate.", "Now what is this tertium quid that is to be the medium of all synthetical judgements?", "It is only a complex in which all our representations are contained, the internal sense to wit, and its form Ã  priori, time.", "The synthesis of our representations rests upon the imagination; their synthetical unity (which is requisite to a judgement), upon the unity of apperception.", "In this, therefore, is to be sought the possibility of synthetical judgements, and as all three contain the sources of Ã  priori representations, the possibility of pure synthetical judgements also; nay, they are necessary upon these grounds, if we are to possess a knowledge of objects, which rests solely upon the synthesis of representations.", "If a cognition is to have objective reality, that is, to relate to an object, and possess sense and meaning in respect to it, it is necessary that the object be given in some way or another.", "Without this, our conceptions are empty, and we may indeed have thought by means of them, but by such thinking we have not, in fact, cognized anything, we have merely played with representation.", "To give an object, if this expression be understood in the sense of â€œto presentâ€ the object, not mediately but immediately in intuition, means nothing else than to apply the representation of it to experience, be that experience real or only possible.", "Space and time themselves, pure as these conceptions are from all that is empirical, and certain as it is that they are represented fully Ã  priori in the mind, would be completely without objective validity, and without sense and significance, if their necessary use in the objects of experience were not shown.", "Nay, the representation of them is a mere schema, that always relates to the reproductive imagination, which calls up the objects of experience, without which they have no meaning.", "And so it is with all conceptions without distinction.", "The possibility of experience is, then, that which gives objective reality to all our Ã  priori cognitions.", "Now experience depends upon the synthetical unity of phenomena, that is, upon a synthesis according to conceptions of the object of phenomena in general, a synthesis without which experience never could become knowledge, but would be merely a rhapsody of perceptions, never fitting together into any connected text, according to rules of a thoroughly united (possible) consciousness, and therefore never subjected to the transcendental and necessary unity of apperception.", "Experience has therefore for a foundation, Ã  priori principles of its form, that is to say, general rules of unity in the synthesis of phenomena, the objective reality of which rules, as necessary conditions even of the possibility of experience can which rules, as necessary conditionsâ€even of the possibility of experienceâ€can always be shown in experience.", "But apart from this relation, Ã  priori synthetical propositions are absolutely impossible, because they have no third term, that is, no pure object, in which the synthetical unity can exhibit the objective reality of its conceptions.", "Although, then, respecting space, or the forms which productive imagination describes therein, we do cognize much Ã  priori in synthetical judgements, and are really in no need of experience for this purpose, such knowledge would nevertheless amount to nothing but a busy trifling with a mere chimera, were not space to be considered as the condition of the phenomena which constitute the material of external experience.", "Hence those pure synthetical judgements do relate, though but mediately, to possible experience, or rather to the possibility of experience, and upon that alone is founded the objective validity of their synthesis.", "While then, on the one hand, experience, as empirical synthesis, is the only possible mode of cognition which gives reality to all other synthesis; on the other hand, this latter synthesis, as cognition Ã  priori, possesses truth, that is, accordance with its object, only in so far as it contains nothing more than what is necessary to the synthetical unity of experience.", "Accordingly, the supreme principle of all synthetical judgements is  â€œEvery object is subject to the necessary conditions of the synthetical unity of the manifold of intuition in a possible experience.â€  Ã€ priori synthetical judgements are possible when we apply the formal conditions of the Ã  priori intuition, the synthesis of the imagination, and the necessary unity of that synthesis in a transcendental apperception, to a possible cognition of experience, and say  â€œThe conditions of the possibility of experience in general are at the same time conditions of the possibility of the objects of experience, and have, for that reason, objective validity in an Ã  priori synthetical judgement.â€  Section III.", "Systematic Representation of all Synthetical Principles of the Pure Understanding  That principles exist at all is to be ascribed solely to the pure understanding, which is not only the faculty of rules in regard to that which happens, but is even the source of principles according to which everything that can be presented to us as an object is necessarily subject to rules, because without such rules we never could attain to cognition of an object.", "Even the laws of nature, if they are contemplated as principles of the empirical use of the understanding, possess also a characteristic of necessity, and we may therefore at least expect them to be determined upon grounds which are valid Ã  priori and antecedent to all experience.", "But all laws of nature, without distinction, are subject to higher principles of the understanding, inasmuch as the former are merely applications of the latter to particular cases of experience.", "These higher principles alone therefore give the conception, which contains the necessary condition, and, as it were, the exponent of a rule; experience, on the other hand, gives the case which comes under the rule.", "There is no danger of our mistaking merely empirical principles for principles of the pure understanding, or conversely; for the character of necessity, according to conceptions which distinguish the latter, and the absence of this in every empirical proposition, how extensively valid soever it may be, is a perfect safeguard against confounding them.", "There are, however, pure principles Ã  priori, which nevertheless I should not ascribe to the pure understandingâ€for this reason, that they are not derived from pure conceptions, but (although by the mediation of the understanding) from pure intuitions.", "But understanding is the faculty of conceptions.", "Such principles mathematical science possesses, but their application to experience, consequently their objective validity, nay the possibility of such Ã  priori synthetical cognitions (the deduction thereof) rests entirely upon the pure understanding.", "On this account, I shall not reckon among my principles those of mathematics; though I shall include those upon the possibility and objective validity Ã  priori, of principles of the mathematical science, which, consequently, are to be looked upon as the principle of these, and which proceed from conceptions to intuition, and not from intuition to conceptions.", "In the application of the pure conceptions of the understanding to possible experience, the employment of their synthesis is either mathematical or dynamical, for it is directed partly on the intuition alone, partly on the existence of a phenomenon.", "But the Ã  priori conditions of intuition are in relation to a possible experience absolutely necessary, those of the existence of objects of a possible empirical intuition are in themselves contingent.", "Hence the principles of the mathematical use of the categories will possess a character of absolute necessity, that is, will be apodeictic; those, on the other hand, of the dynamical use, the character of an Ã  priori necessity indeed, but only under the condition of empirical thought in an experience, therefore only mediately and indirectly.", "Consequently they will not possess that immediate evidence which is peculiar to the former, although their application to experience does not, for that reason, lose its truth and certitude.", "But of this point we shall be better able to judge at the conclusion of this system of principles.", "The table of the categories is naturally our guide to the table of principles, because these are nothing else than rules for the objective employment of the former.", "Accordingly, all principles of the pure understanding are                                   1                               Axioms                            of Intuition                 2                                    3

employment of these principles.", "It will, however, soon appear thatâ€a fact which concerns both the evidence of these principles, and the Ã  priori determination of phenomenaâ€according to the categories of quantity and quality (if we attend merely to the form of these), the principles of these categories are distinguishable from those of the two others, in as much as the former are possessed of an intuitive, but the latter of a merely discursive, though in both instances a complete, certitude.", "I shall therefore call the former mathematical, and the latter dynamical principles.", "[27] It must be observed, however, that by these terms I mean just as little in the one case the principles of mathematics as those of general (physical) dynamics in the other.", "I have here in view merely the principles of the pure understanding, in their application to the internal sense (without distinction of the representations given therein), by means of which the sciences of mathematics and dynamics become possible.", "Accordingly, I have named these principles rather with reference to their application than their content; and I shall now proceed to consider them in the order in which they stand in the table.", "[27] All combination (conjunctio) is either composition (compositio)  or connection (nexus).", "The former is the synthesis of a manifold, the  parts of which do not necessarily belong to each other.", "For example,  the two triangles into which a square is divided by a diagonal, do not  necessarily belong to each other, and of this kind is the synthesis of  the homogeneous in everything that can be mathematically considered.", "This synthesis can be divided into those of aggregation and coalition,  the former of which is applied to extensive, the latter to intensive  quantities.", "The second sort of combination (nexus) is the synthesis of  a manifold, in so far as its parts do belong necessarily to each  other; for example, the accident to a substance, or the effect to the  cause.", "Consequently it is a synthesis of that which though  heterogeneous, is represented as connected Ã  priori.", "This  combinationâ€not an

Extensive Quantities.", "PROOF.", "All phenomena contain, as regards their form, an intuition in space and time, which lies Ã  priori at the foundation of all without exception.", "Phenomena, therefore, cannot be apprehended, that is, received into empirical consciousness otherwise than through the synthesis of a manifold, through which the representations of a determinate space or time are generated; that is to say, through the composition of the homogeneous and the consciousness of the synthetical unity of this manifold (homogeneous).", "Now the consciousness of a homogeneous manifold in intuition, in so far as thereby the representation of an object is rendered possible, is the conception of a quantity (quanti).", "Consequently, even the perception of an object as phenomenon is possible only through the same synthetical unity of the manifold of the given sensuous intuition, through which the unity of the composition of the homogeneous manifold in the conception of a quantity is cogitated; that is to say, all phenomena are quantities, and extensive quantities, because as intuitions in space or time they must be represented by means of the same synthesis through which space and time themselves are determined.", "An extensive quantity I call that wherein the representation of the parts renders possible (and therefore necessarily antecedes) the representation of the whole.", "I cannot represent to myself any line, however small, without drawing it in thought, that is, without generating from a point all its parts one after another, and in this way alone producing this intuition.", "Precisely the same is the case with every, even the smallest, portion of time.", "I cogitate therein only the successive progress from one moment to another, and hence, by means of the different portions of time and the addition of them, a determinate quantity of time is produced.", "As the pure intuition in all phenomena is either time or space, so is every phenomenon in its character of intuition an extensive quantity, inasmuch as it can only be cognized in our apprehension by successive synthesis (from part to part).", "All phenomena are, accordingly, to be considered as aggregates, that is, as a collection of previously given parts; which is not the case with every sort of quantities, but only with those which are represented and apprehended by us as extensive.", "On this successive synthesis of the productive imagination, in the generation of figures, is founded the mathematics of extension, or geometry, with its axioms, which express the conditions of sensuous intuition Ã  priori, under which alone the schema of a pure conception of external intuition can exist; for example, â€œbe tween two points only one straight line is possible,â€ â€œtwo straight lines cannot enclose a space,â€ etc.", "These are the axioms which properly relate only to quantities (quanta) as such.", "But, as regards the quantity of a thing (quantitas), that is to say, the answer to the question  â€œHow large is this or that object?â€ although, in respect to this question, we have various propositions synthetical and immediately certain (indemonstrabilia); we have, in the proper sense of the term, no axioms.", "For example, the propositions  â€œIf equals be added to equals, the wholes are equalâ€; â€œIf equals be taken from equals, the remainders are equalâ€; are analytical, because I am immediately conscious of the identity of the production of the one quantity with the production of the other; whereas axioms must be Ã  priori synthetical propositions.", "On the other hand, the self evident propositions as to the relation of numbers, are certainly synthetical but not universal, like those of geometry, and for this reason cannot be called axioms, but numerical formulae.", "That 7 + 5 = 12 is not an analytical proposition.", "For neither in the representation of seven, nor of five, nor of the composition of the two numbers, do I cogitate the number twelve.", "(Whether I cogitate the number in the addition of both, is not at present the question; for in the case of an analytical proposition, the only point is whether I really cogitate the predicate in the representation of the subject.)", "But although the proposition is synthetical, it is nevertheless only a singular proposition.", "In so far as regard is here had merely to the synthesis of the homogeneous (the units), it cannot take place except in one manner, although our use of these numbers is afterwards general.", "If I say  â€œA triangle can be constructed with three lines, any two of which taken together are greater than the third,â€ I exercise merely the pure function of the productive imagination, which may draw the lines longer or shorter and construct the angles at its pleasure.", "On the contrary, the number seven is possible only in one manner, and so is likewise the number twelve, which results from the synthesis of seven and five.", "Such propositions, then, cannot be termed axioms (for in that case we should have an infinity of these), but numerical formulae.", "This transcendental principle of the mathematics of phenomena greatly enlarges our Ã  priori cognition.", "For it is by this principle alone that pure mathematics is rendered applicable in all its precision to objects of experience, and without it the validity of this application would not be so self evident; on the contrary, contradictions and confusions have often arisen on this very point.", "Phenomena are not things in themselves.", "Empirical intuition is possible only through pure intuition (of space and time); consequently, what geometry affirms of the latter, is indisputably valid of the former.", "All evasions, such as the statement that objects of sense do not conform to the rules of construction in space (for example, to the rule of the infinite divisibility of lines or angles), must fall to the ground.", "For, if these objections hold good, we deny to space, and with it to all mathematics, objective validity, and no longer know wherefore, and how far, mathematics can be applied to phenomena.", "The synthesis of spaces and times as the essential form of all intuition, is that which renders possible the apprehension of a phenomenon, and therefore every external experience, consequently all cognition of the objects of experience; and whatever mathematics in its pure use proves of the former, must necessarily hold good of the latter.", "All objections are but the chicaneries of an ill instructed reason, which erroneously thinks to liberate the objects of sense from the formal conditions of our sensibility, and represents these, although mere phenomena, as things in themselves, presented as such to our understanding.", "But in this case, no Ã  priori synthetical cognition of them could be possible, consequently not through pure conceptions of space and the science which determines these conceptions, that is to say, geometry, would itself be impossible.", "2.", "ANTICIPATIONS OF PERCEPTION.", "The principle of these is  In all phenomena the Real, that which is an object of sensation, has Intensive Quantity, that is, has a Degree.", "PROOF.", "Perception is empirical consciousness, that is to say, a consciousness which contains an element of sensation.", "Phenomena as objects of perception are not pure, that is, merely formal intuitions, like space and time, for they cannot be perceived in themselves.", "[28] They contain, then, over and above the intuition, the materials for an object (through which is represented something existing in space or time), that is to say, they contain the real of sensation, as a representation merely subjective, which gives us merely the consciousness that the subject is affected, and which we refer to some external object.", "Now, a gradual transition from empirical consciousness to pure consciousness is possible, inasmuch as the real in this consciousness entirely vanishes, and there remains a merely formal consciousness (Ã  priori) of the manifold in time and space; consequently there is possible a synthesis also of the production of the quantity of a sensation from its commencement, that is, from the pure intuition = 0 onwards up to a certain quantity of the sensation.", "Now as sensation in itself is not an objective representation, and in it is to be found neither the intuition of space nor of time, it cannot possess any extensive quantity, and yet there does belong to it a quantity (and that by means of its apprehension, in which empirical consciousness can within a certain time rise from nothing = 0 up to its given amount), consequently an intensive quantity.", "And thus we must ascribe intensive quantity, that is, a degree of influence on sense to all objects of perception, in so far as this perception contains sensation.", "[28] They can be perceived only as phenomena, and some part of them  must always belong to the non ego; whereas pure intuitions are  entirely the products of the mind itself, and as such are cognized _in  themselves.â€Tr_   All cognition, by means of which I am enabled to cognize and determine Ã  priori what belongs to empirical cognition, may be called an anticipation; and without doubt this is the sense in which Epicurus employed his expression prholepsis.", "But as there is in phenomena something which is never cognized Ã  priori, which on this account constitutes the proper difference between pure and empirical cognition, that is to say, sensation (as the matter of perception), it follows, that sensation is just that element in cognition which cannot be at all anticipated.", "On the other hand, we might very well term the pure determinations in space and time, as well in regard to figure as to quantity, anticipations of phenomena, because they represent Ã  priori that which may always be given Ã  posteriori in experience.", "But suppose that in every sensation, as sensation in general, without any particular sensation being thought of, there existed something which could be cognized Ã  priori, this would deserve to be called anticipation in a special senseâ€special, because it may seem surprising to forestall experience, in that which concerns the matter of experience, and which we can only derive from itself.", "Yet such really is the case here.", "Apprehension[29], by means of sensation alone, fills only one moment, that is, if I do not take into consideration a succession of many sensations.", "As that in the phenomenon, the apprehension of which is not a successive synthesis advancing from parts to an entire representation, sensation has therefore no extensive quantity; the want of sensation in a moment of time would represent it as empty, consequently = 0.", "That which in the empirical intuition corresponds to sensation is reality (realitas phaenomenon); that which corresponds to the absence of it, negation = 0.", "Now every sensation is capable of a diminution, so that it can decrease, and thus gradually disappear.", "Therefore, between reality in a phenomenon and negation, there exists a continuous concatenation of many possible intermediate sensations, the difference of which from each other is always smaller than that between the given sensation and zero, or complete negation.", "That is to say, the real in a phenomenon has always a quantity, which however is not discoverable in apprehension, inasmuch as apprehension take place by means of mere sensation in one instant, and not by the successive synthesis of many sensations, and therefore does not progress from parts to the whole.", "Consequently, it has a quantity, but not an extensive quantity.", "[29] Apprehension is the Kantian word for preception, in the largest  sense in which we employ that term.", "It is the genus which includes  under i, as species, perception proper and sensation properâ€Tr   Now that quantity which is apprehended only as unity, and in which plurality can be represented only by approximation to negation = O, I term intensive quantity.", "Consequently, reality in a phenomenon has intensive quantity, that is, a degree.", "If we consider this reality as cause (be it of sensation or of another reality in the phenomenon, for example, a change), we call the degree of reality in its character of cause a momentum, for example, the momentum of weight; and for this reason, that the degree only indicates that quantity the apprehension of which is not successive, but instantaneous.", "This, however, I touch upon only in passing, for with causality I have at present nothing to do.", "Accordingly, every sensation, consequently every reality in phenomena, however small it may be, has a degree, that is, an intensive quantity, which may always be lessened, and between reality and negation there exists a continuous connection of possible realities, and possible smaller perceptions.", "Every colourâ€for example, redâ€has a degree, which, be it ever so small, is never the smallest, and so is it always with heat, the momentum of weight, etc.", "This property of quantities, according to which no part of them is the smallest possible (no part simple), is called their continuity.", "Space and time are quanta continua, because no part of them can be given, without enclosing it within boundaries (points and moments), consequently, this given part is itself a space or a time.", "Space, therefore, consists only of spaces, and time of times.", "Points and moments are only boundaries, that is, the mere places or positions of their limitation.", "But places always presuppose intuitions which are to limit or determine them; and we cannot conceive either space or time composed of constituent parts which are given before space or time.", "Such quantities may also be called flowing, because synthesis (of the productive imagination) in the production of these quantities is a progression in time, the continuity of which we are accustomed to indicate by the expression flowing.", "All phenomena, then, are continuous quantities, in respect both to intuition and mere perception (sensation, and with it reality).", "In the former case they are extensive quantities; in the latter, intensive.", "When the synthesis of the manifold of a phenomenon is interrupted, there results merely an aggregate of several phenomena, and not properly a phenomenon as a quantity, which is not produced by the mere continuation of the productive synthesis of a certain kind, but by the repetition of a synthesis always ceasing.", "For example, if I call thirteen dollars a sum or quantity of money, I employ the term quite correctly, inasmuch as I understand by thirteen dollars the value of a mark in standard silver, which is, to be sure, a continuous quantity, in which no part is the smallest, but every part might constitute a piece of money, which would contain material for still smaller pieces.", "If, however, by the words thirteen dollars I understand so many coins (be their value in silver what it may), it would be quite erroneous to use the expression a quantity of dollars; on the contrary, I must call them aggregate, that is, a number of coins.", "And as in every number we must have unity as the foundation, so a phenomenon taken as unity is a quantity, and as such always a continuous quantity (quantum continuum).", "Now, seeing all phenomena, whether considered as extensive or intensive, are continuous quantities, the proposition  â€œAll change (transition of a thing from one state into another) is continuous,â€ might be proved here easily, and with mathematical evidence, were it not that the causality of a change lies, entirely beyond the bounds of a transcendental philosophy, and presupposes empirical principles.", "For of the possibility of a cause which changes the condition of things, that is, which determines them to the contrary to a certain given state, the understanding gives us Ã  priori no knowledge; not merely because it has no insight into the possibility of it (for such insight is absent in several Ã  priori cognitions), but because the notion of change concerns only certain determinations of phenomena, which experience alone can acquaint us with, while their cause lies in the unchangeable.", "But seeing that we have nothing which we could here employ but the pure fundamental conceptions of all possible experience, among which of course nothing empirical can be admitted, we dare not, without injuring the unity of our system, anticipate general physical science, which is built upon certain fundamental experiences.", "Nevertheless, we are in no want of proofs of the great influence which the principle above developed exercises in the anticipation of perceptions, and even in supplying the want of them, so far as to shield us against the false conclusions which otherwise we might rashly draw.", "If all reality in perception has a degree, between which and negation there is an endless sequence of ever smaller degrees, and if, nevertheless, every sense must have a determinate degree of receptivity for sensations; no perception, and consequently no experience is possible, which can prove, either immediately or mediately, an entire absence of all reality in a phenomenon; in other words, it is impossible ever to draw from experience a proof of the existence of empty space or of empty time.", "For in the first place, an entire absence of reality in a sensuous intuition cannot of course be an object of perception; secondly, such absence cannot be deduced from the contemplation of any single phenomenon, and the difference of the degrees in its reality; nor ought it ever to be admitted in explanation of any phenomenon.", "For if even the complete intuition of a determinate space or time is thoroughly real, that is, if no part thereof is empty, yet because every reality has its degree, which, with the extensive quantity of the phenomenon unchanged, can diminish through endless gradations down to nothing (the void), there must be infinitely graduated degrees, with which space or time is filled, and the intensive quantity in different phenomena may be smaller or greater, although the extensive quantity of the intuition remains equal and unaltered.", "We shall give an example of this.", "Almost all natural philosophers, remarking a great difference in the quantity of the matter of different kinds in bodies with the same volume (partly on account of the momentum of gravity or weight, partly on account of the momentum of resistance to other bodies in motion), conclude unanimously that this volume (extensive quantity of the phenomenon) must be void in all bodies, although in different proportion.", "But who would suspect that these for the most part mathematical and mechanical inquirers into nature should ground this conclusion solely on a metaphysical hypothesisâ€a sort of hypothesis which they profess to disparage and avoid?", "Yet this they do, in assuming that the real in space (I must not here call it impenetrability or weight, because these are empirical conceptions) is always identical, and can only be distinguished according to its extensive quantity, that is, multiplicity.", "Now to this presupposition, for which they can have no ground in experience, and which consequently is merely metaphysical, I oppose a transcendental demonstration, which it is true will not explain the difference in the filling up of spaces, but which nevertheless completely does away with the supposed necessity of the above mentioned presupposition that we cannot explain the said difference otherwise than by the hypothesis of empty spaces.", "This demonstration, moreover, has the merit of setting the understanding at liberty to conceive this distinction in a different manner, if the explanation of the fact requires any such hypothesis.", "For we perceive that although two equal spaces may be completely filled by matters altogether different, so that in neither of them is there left a single point wherein matter is not present, nevertheless, every reality has its degree (of resistance or of weight), which, without diminution of the extensive quantity, can become less and less ad infinitum, before it passes into nothingness and disappears.", "Thus an expansion which fills a spaceâ€for example, caloric, or any other reality in the phenomenal worldâ€can decrease in its degrees to infinity, yet without leaving the smallest part of the space empty; on the contrary, filling it with those lesser degrees as completely as another phenomenon could with greater.", "My intention here is by no means to maintain that this is really the case with the difference of matters, in regard to their specific gravity; I wish only to prove, from a principle of the pure understanding, that the nature of our perceptions makes such a mode of explanation possible, and that it is erroneous to regard the real in a phenomenon as equal quoad its degree, and different only quoad its aggregation and extensive quantity, and this, too, on the pretended authority of an Ã  priori principle of the understanding.", "Nevertheless, this principle of the anticipation of perception must somewhat startle an inquirer whom initiation into transcendental philosophy has rendered cautious.", "We must naturally entertain some doubt whether or not the understanding can enounce any such synthetical proposition as that respecting the degree of all reality in phenomena, and consequently the possibility of the internal difference of sensation itselfâ€abstraction being made of its empirical quality.", "Thus it is a question not unworthy of solution  â€œHow the understanding can pronounce synthetically and Ã  priori respecting phenomena, and thus anticipate these, even in that which is peculiarly and merely empirical, that, namely, which concerns sensation itself?â€  The quality of sensation is in all cases merely empirical, and cannot be represented Ã  priori (for example, colours, taste, etc.).", "But the realâ€that which corresponds to sensationâ€in opposition to negation = 0, only represents something the conception of which in itself contains a being (ein seyn), and signifies nothing but the synthesis in an empirical consciousness.", "That is to say, the empirical consciousness in the internal sense can be raised from 0 to every higher degree, so that the very same extensive quantity of intuition, an illuminated surface, for example, excites as great a sensation as an aggregate of many other surfaces less illuminated.", "We can therefore make complete abstraction of the extensive quantity of a phenomenon, and represent to ourselves in the mere sensation in a certain momentum, a synthesis of homogeneous ascension from 0 up to the given empirical consciousness, All sensations therefore as such are given only Ã  posteriori, but this property thereof, namely, that they have a degree, can be known Ã  priori.", "It is worthy of remark, that in respect to quantities in general, we can cognize Ã  priori only a single quality, namely, continuity; but in respect to all quality (the real in phenomena), we cannot cognize Ã  priori anything more than the intensive quantity thereof, namely, that they have a degree.", "All else is left to experience.", "3.", "ANALOGIES OF EXPERIENCE.", "The principle of these is  Experience is possible only through the representation of a necessary connection of Perceptions.", "PROOF.", "Experience is an empirical cognition; that is to say, a cognition which determines an object by means of perceptions.", "It is therefore a synthesis of perceptions, a synthesis which is not itself contained in perception, but which contains the synthetical unity of the manifold of perception in a consciousness; and this unity constitutes the essential of our cognition of objects of the senses, that is, of experience (not merely of intuition or sensation).", "Now in experience our perceptions come together contingently, so that no character of necessity in their connection appears, or can appear from the perceptions themselves, because apprehension is only a placing together of the manifold of empirical intuition, and no representation of a necessity in the connected existence of the phenomena which apprehension brings together, is to be discovered therein.", "But as experience is a cognition of objects by means of perceptions, it follows that the relation of the existence of the existence of the manifold must be represented in experience not as it is put together in time, but as it is objectively in time.", "And as time itself cannot be perceived, the determination of the existence of objects in time can only take place by means of their connection in time in general, consequently only by means of Ã  priori connecting conceptions.", "Now as these conceptions always possess the character of necessity, experience is possible only by means of a representation of the necessary connection of perception.", "The three modi of time are permanence, succession, and coexistence.", "Accordingly, there are three rules of all relations of time in phenomena, according to which the existence of every phenomenon is determined in respect of the unity of all time, and these antecede all experience and render it possible.", "The general principle of all three analogies rests on the necessary unity of apperception in relation to all possible empirical consciousness (perception) at every time, consequently, as this unity lies Ã  priori at the foundation of all mental operations, the principle rests on the synthetical unity of all phenomena according to their relation in time.", "For the original apperception relates to our internal sense (the complex of all representations), and indeed relates Ã  priori to its form, that is to say, the relation of the manifold empirical consciousness in time.", "Now this manifold must be combined in original apperception according to relations of timeâ€a necessity imposed by the Ã  priori transcendental unity of apperception, to which is subjected all that can belong to my (i.e., my own) cognition, and therefore all that can become an object for me.", "This synthetical and Ã  priori determined unity in relation of perceptions in time is therefore the rule  â€œAll empirical determinations of time must be subject to rules of the general determination of timeâ€; and the analogies of experience, of which we are now about to treat, must be rules of this nature.", "These principles have this peculiarity, that they do not concern phenomena, and the synthesis of the empirical intuition thereof, but merely the existence of phenomena and their relation to each other in regard to this existence.", "Now the mode in which we apprehend a thing in a phenomenon can be determined Ã  priori in such a manner that the rule of its synthesis can give, that is to say, can produce this Ã  priori intuition in every empirical example.", "But the existence of phenomena cannot be known Ã  priori, and although we could arrive by this path at a conclusion of the fact of some existence, we could not cognize that existence determinately, that is to say, we should be incapable of anticipating in what respect the empirical intuition of it would be distinguishable from that of others.", "The two principles above mentioned, which I called mathematical, in consideration of the fact of their authorizing the application of mathematic phenomena, relate to these phenomena only in regard to their possibility, and instruct us how phenomena, as far as regards their intuition or the real in their perception, can be generated according to the rules of a mathematical synthesis.", "Consequently, numerical quantities, and with them the determination of a phenomenon as a quantity, can be employed in the one case as well as in the other.", "Thus, for example, out of 200,000 illuminations by the moon, I might compose and give Ã  priori, that is construct, the degree of our sensations of the sun light.", "[30] We may therefore entitle these two principles constitutive.", "[30] Kantâ€™s meaning is  The two principles enunciated under the heads  of â€œAxioms of Intuition,â€ and â€œAnticipations of Perception,â€ authorize  the application to phenomena of determinations of size and number,  that is of mathematic.", "For example, I may compute the light of the  sun, and say that its quantity is a certain number of times greater  than that of the moon.", "In the same way, heat is measured by the  comparison of its different effects on water, &c., and on mercury in a  thermometer.â€Tr   The case is very different with those principles whose province it is to subject the existence of phenomena to rules Ã  priori.", "For as existence does not admit of being constructed, it is clear that they must only concern the relations of existence and be merely regulative principles.", "In this case, therefore, neither axioms nor anticipations are to be thought of.", "Thus, if a perception is given us, in a certain relation of time to other (although undetermined) perceptions, we cannot then say Ã  priori, what and how great (in quantity) the other perception necessarily connected with the former is, but only how it is connected, quoad its existence, in this given modus of time.", "Analogies in philosophy mean something very different from that which they represent in mathematics.", "In the latter they are formulae, which enounce the equality of two relations of quantity, and are always constitutive, so that if two terms of the proportion are given, the third is also given, that is, can be constructed by the aid of these formulae.", "But in philosophy, analogy is not the equality of two quantitative but of two qualitative relations.", "In this case, from three given terms, I can give Ã  priori and cognize the relation to a fourth member, but not this fourth term itself, although I certainly possess a rule to guide me in the search for this fourth term in experience, and a mark to assist me in discovering it.", "An analogy of experience is therefore only a rule according to which unity of experience must arise out of perceptions in respect to objects (phenomena) not as a constitutive, but merely as a regulative principle.", "The same holds good also of the postulates of empirical thought in general, which relate to the synthesis of mere intuition (which concerns the form of phenomena), the synthesis of perception (which concerns the matter of phenomena), and the synthesis of experience (which concerns the relation of these perceptions).", "For they are only regulative principles, and clearly distinguishable from the mathematical, which are constitutive, not indeed in regard to the certainty which both possess Ã  priori, but in the mode of evidence thereof, consequently also in the manner of demonstration.", "But what has been observed of all synthetical propositions, and must be particularly remarked in this place, is this, that these analogies possess significance and validity, not as principles of the transcendental, but only as principles of the empirical use of the understanding, and their truth can therefore be proved only as such, and that consequently the phenomena must not be subjoined directly under the categories, but only under their schemata.", "For if the objects to which those principles must be applied were things in themselves, it would be quite impossible to cognize aught concerning them synthetically Ã  priori.", "But they are nothing but phenomena; a complete knowledge of whichâ€a knowledge to which all principles Ã  priori must at last relateâ€is the only possible experience.", "It follows that these principles can have nothing else for their aim than the conditions of the empirical cognition in the unity of synthesis of phenomena.", "But this synthesis is cogitated only in the schema of the pure conception of the understanding, of whose unity, as that of a synthesis in general, the category contains the function unrestricted by any sensuous condition.", "These principles will therefore authorize us to connect phenomena according to an analogy, with the logical and universal unity of conceptions, and consequently to employ the categories in the principles themselves; but in the application of them to experience, we shall use only their schemata, as the key to their proper application, instead of the categories, or rather the latter as restricting conditions, under the title of â€œformulaeâ€ of the former.", "A. FIRST ANALOGY.", "Principle of the Permanence of Substance.", "In all changes of phenomena, substance is permanent, and the quantum thereof in nature is neither increased nor diminished.", "PROOF.", "All phenomena exist in time, wherein alone as substratum, that is, as the permanent form of the internal intuition, coexistence and succession can be represented.", "Consequently time, in which all changes of phenomena must be cogitated, remains and changes not, because it is that in which succession and coexistence can be represented only as determinations thereof.", "Now, time in itself cannot be an object of perception.", "It follows that in objects of perception, that is, in phenomena, there must be found a substratum which represents time in general, and in which all change or coexistence can be perceived by means of the relation of phenomena to it.", "But the substratum of all reality, that is, of all that pertains to the existence of things, is substance; all that pertains to existence can be cogitated only as a determination of substance.", "Consequently, the permanent, in relation to which alone can all relations of time in phenomena be determined, is substance in the world of phenomena, that is, the real in phenomena, that which, as the substratum of all change, remains ever the same.", "Accordingly, as this cannot change in existence, its quantity in nature can neither be increased nor diminished.", "Our apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon is always successive, is Consequently always changing.", "By it alone we could, therefore, never determine whether this manifold, as an object of experience, is coexistent or successive, unless it had for a foundation something fixed and permanent, of the existence of which all succession and coexistence are nothing but so many modes (modi of time).", "Only in the permanent, then, are relations of time possible (for simultaneity and succession are the only relations in time); that is to say, the permanent is the substratum of our empirical representation of time itself, in which alone all determination of time is possible.", "Permanence is, in fact, just another expression for time, as the abiding correlate of all existence of phenomena, and of all change, and of all coexistence.", "For change does not affect time itself, but only the phenomena in time (just as coexistence cannot be regarded as a modus of time itself, seeing that in time no parts are coexistent, but all successive).", "If we were to attribute succession to time itself, we should be obliged to cogitate another time, in which this succession would be possible.", "It is only by means of the permanent that existence in different parts of the successive series of time receives a quantity, which we entitle duration.", "For in mere succession, existence is perpetually vanishing and recommencing, and therefore never has even the least quantity.", "Without the permanent, then, no relation in time is possible.", "Now, time in itself is not an object of perception; consequently the permanent in phenomena must be regarded as the substratum of all determination of time, and consequently also as the condition of the possibility of all synthetical unity of perceptions, that is, of experience; and all existence and all change in time can only be regarded as a mode in the existence of that which abides unchangeably.", "Therefore, in all phenomena, the permanent is the object in itself, that is, the substance (phenomenon); but all that changes or can change belongs only to the mode of the existence of this substance or substances, consequently to its determinations.", "I find that in all ages not only the philosopher, but even the common understanding, has preposited this permanence as a substratum of all change in phenomena; indeed, I am compelled to believe that they will always accept this as an indubitable fact.", "Only the philosopher expresses himself in a more precise and definite manner, when he says  â€œIn all changes in the world, the substance remains, and the accidents alone are changeable.â€ But of this decidedly synthetical proposition, I nowhere meet with even an attempt at proof;

Between two moments there is always a certain time, and between two states existing in these moments there is always a difference having a certain quantity (for all parts of phenomena are in their turn quantities).", "Consequently, every transition from one state into another is always effected in a time contained between two moments, of which the first determines the state which leaves, and the second determines the state into the thing passes.", "The thing leaves, and the second determines the state into which the thing Both moments, then, are limitations of the time of a change, consequently of the intermediate state between both, and as such they belong to the total of the change.", "Now every change has a cause, which evidences its causality in the whole time during which the charge takes place.", "The cause, therefore, does not produce the change all at once or in one moment, but in a time, so that, as the time gradually increases from the commencing instant, a, to its completion at b, in like manner also, the quantity of the reality (b   a) is generated through the lesser degrees which are contained between the first and last.", "All change is therefore possible only through a continuous action of the causality, which, in so far as it is uniform, we call a momentum.", "The change does not consist of these momenta, but is generated or produced by them as their effect.", "Such is the law of the continuity of all change, the ground of which is that neither time itself nor any phenomenon in time consists of parts which are the smallest possible, but that, notwithstanding, the state of a thing passes in the process of a change through all these parts, as elements, to its second state.", "There is no smallest degree of reality in a phenomenon, just as there is no smallest degree in the quantity of time; and so the new state of reality grows up out of the former state, through all the infinite degrees thereof, the differences of which one from another, taken all together, are less than the difference between o and a.  It is not our business to inquire here into the utility of this principle in the investigation of nature.", "But how such a proposition, which appears so greatly to extend our knowledge of nature, is possible completely Ã  priori, is indeed a question which deserves investigation, although the first view seems to demonstrate the truth and reality of the principle, and the question, how it is possible, may be considered superfluous.", "For there are so many groundless pretensions to the enlargement of our knowledge by pure reason that we must take it as a general rule to be mistrustful of all such, and without a thoroughgoing and radical deduction, to believe nothing of the sort even on the clearest dogmatical evidence.", "Every addition to our empirical knowledge, and every advance made in the exercise of our perception, is nothing more than an extension of the determination of the internal sense, that is to say, a progression in time, be objects themselves what they may, phenomena, or pure intuitions.", "This progression in time determines everything, and is itself determined by nothing else.", "That is to say, the parts of the progression exist only in time, and by means of the synthesis thereof, and are not given antecedently to it.", "For this reason, every transition in perception to anything which follows upon another in time, is a determination of time by means of the production of this perception.", "And as this determination of time is, always and in all its parts, a quantity, the perception produced is to be considered as a quantity which proceeds through all its degreesâ€no one of which is the smallest possibleâ€from zero up to its determined degree.", "From this we perceive the possibility of cognizing Ã  priori a law of changesâ€a law, however, which concerns their form merely.", "We merely anticipate our own apprehension, the formal condition of which, inasmuch as it is itself to be found in the mind antecedently to all given phenomena, must certainly be capable of being cognized Ã  priori.", "Thus, as time contains the sensuous condition Ã  priori of the possibility of a continuous progression of that which exists to that which follows it, the understanding, by virtue of the unity of apperception, contains the condition Ã  priori of the possibility of a continuous determination of the position in time of all phenomena, and this by means of the series of causes and effects, the former of which necessitate the sequence of the latter, and thereby render universally and for all time, and by consequence, objectively, valid the empirical cognition of the relations of time.", "C. THIRD ANALOGY.", "Principle of Coexistence, According to the Law of Reciprocity or Community.", "All substances, in so far as they can be perceived in space at the same time, exist in a state of complete reciprocity of action.", "PROOF.", "Things are coexistent, when in empirical intuition the perception of the one can follow upon the perception of the other, and vice versaâ€which cannot occur in the succession of phenomena, as we have shown in the explanation of the second principle.", "Thus I can perceive the moon and then the earth, or conversely, first the earth and then the moon; and for the reason that my perceptions of these objects can reciprocally follow each other, I say, they exist contemporaneously.", "Now coexistence is the existence of the manifold in the same time.", "But time itself is not an object of perception; and therefore we cannot conclude from the fact that things are placed in the same time, the other fact, that the perception of these things can follow each other reciprocally.", "The synthesis of the imagination in apprehension would only present to us each of these perceptions as present in the subject when the other is not present, and contrariwise; but would not show that the objects are coexistent, that is to say, that, if the one exists, the other also exists in the same time, and that this is necessarily so, in order that the perceptions may be capable of following each other reciprocally.", "It follows that a conception of the understanding or category of the reciprocal sequence of the determinations of phenomena (existing, as they do, apart from each other, and yet contemporaneously), is requisite to justify us in saying that the reciprocal succession of perceptions has its foundation in the object, and to enable us to represent coexistence as objective.", "But that relation of substances in which the one contains determinations the ground of which is in the other substance, is the relation of influence.", "And, when this influence is reciprocal, it is the relation of community or reciprocity.", "Consequently the coexistence of substances in space cannot be cognized in experience otherwise than under the precondition of their reciprocal action.", "This is therefore the condition of the possibility of things themselves as objects of experience.", "Things are coexistent, in so far as they exist in one and the same time.", "But how can we know that they exist in one and the same time?", "Only by observing that the order in the synthesis of apprehension of the manifold is arbitrary and a matter of indifference, that is to say, that it can proceed from A, through B, C, D, to E, or contrariwise from E to A. For if they were successive in time (and in the order, let us suppose, which begins with A), it is quite impossible for the apprehension in perception to begin with E and go backwards to A, inasmuch as A belongs to past time and, therefore, cannot be an object of apprehension.", "Let us assume that in a number of substances considered as phenomena each is completely isolated, that is, that no one acts upon another.", "Then I say that the coexistence of these cannot be an object of possible perception and that the existence of one cannot, by any mode of empirical synthesis, lead us to the existence of another.", "For we imagine them in this case to be separated by a completely void space, and thus perception, which proceeds from the one to the other in time, would indeed determine their existence by means of a following perception, but would be quite unable to distinguish whether the one phenomenon follows objectively upon the first, or is coexistent with it.", "Besides the mere fact of existence, then, there must be something by means of which A determines the position of B in time and, conversely, B the position of A; because only under this condition can substances be empirically represented as existing contemporaneously.", "Now that alone determines the position of another thing in time which is the cause of it or of its determinations.", "Consequently every substance (inasmuch as it can have succession predicated of it only in respect of its determinations) must contain the causality of certain determinations in another substance, and at the same time the effects of the causality of the other in itself.", "That is to say, substances must stand (mediately or immediately) in dynamical community with each other, if coexistence is to be cognized in any possible experience.", "But, in regard to objects of experience, that is absolutely necessary without which the experience of these objects would itself be impossible.", "Consequently it is absolutely necessary that all substances in the world of phenomena, in so far as they are coexistent, stand in a relation of complete community of reciprocal action to each other.", "The word community has in our language[33] two meanings, and contains the two notions conveyed in the Latin communio and commercium.", "We employ it in this place in the latter senseâ€that of a dynamical community, without which even the community of place (communio spatii) could not be empirically cognized.", "In our experiences it is easy to observe that it is only the continuous influences in all parts of space that can conduct our senses from one object to another; that the light which plays between our eyes and the heavenly bodies produces a mediating community between them and us, and thereby evidences their coexistence with us; that we cannot empirically change our position (perceive this change), unless the existence of matter throughout the whole of space rendered possible the perception of the positions we occupy; and that this perception can prove the contemporaneous existence of these places only through their reciprocal influence, and thereby also the coexistence of even the most remote objectsâ€although in this case the proof is only mediate.", "Without community, every perception (of a phenomenon in space) is separated from every other and isolated, and the chain of empirical representations, that is, of experience, must, with the appearance of a new object, begin entirely de novo, without the least connection with preceding representations, and without standing towards these even in the relation of time.", "My intention here is by no means to combat the notion of empty space; for it may exist where our perceptions cannot exist, inasmuch as they cannot reach thereto, and where, therefore, no empirical perception of coexistence takes place.", "But in this case it is not an object of possible experience.", "[33] German   The following remarks may be useful in the way of explanation.", "In the mind, all phenomena, as contents of a possible experience, must exist in community (communio) of apperception or consciousness, and in so far as it is requisite that objects be represented as coexistent and connected, in so far must they reciprocally determine the position in time of each other and thereby constitute a whole.", "If this subjective community is to rest upon an objective basis, or to be applied to substances as phenomena, the perception of one substance must render possible the perception of another, and conversely.", "For otherwise succession, which is always found in perceptions as apprehensions, would be predicated of external objects, and their representation of their coexistence be thus impossible.", "But this is a reciprocal influence, that is to say, a real community (commercium) of substances, without which therefore the empirical relation of coexistence would be a notion beyond the reach of our minds.", "By virtue of this commercium, phenomena, in so far as they are apart from, and nevertheless in connection with each other, constitute a compositum reale.", "Such composita are possible in many different ways.", "The three dynamical relations then, from which all others spring, are those of inherence, consequence, and composition.", "These, then, are the three analogies of experience.", "They are nothing more than principles of the determination of the existence of phenomena in time, according to the three modi of this determination; to wit, the relation to time itself as a quantity (the quantity of existence, that is, duration), the relation in time as a series or succession, finally, the relation in time as the complex of all existence (simultaneity).", "This unity of determination in regard to time is thoroughly dynamical; that is to say, time is not considered as that in which experience determines immediately to every existence its position; for this is impossible, inasmuch as absolute time is not an object of perception, by means of which phenomena can be connected with each other.", "On the contrary, the rule of the understanding, through which alone the existence of phenomena can receive synthetical unity as regards relations of time, determines for every phenomenon its position in time, and consequently Ã  priori, and with validity for all and every time.", "By nature, in the empirical sense of the word, we understand the totality of phenomena connected, in respect of their existence, according to necessary rules, that is, laws.", "There are therefore certain laws (which are moreover Ã  priori) which make nature possible; and all empirical laws can exist only by means of experience, and by virtue of those primitive laws through which experience itself becomes possible.", "The purpose of the analogies is therefore to represent to us the unity of nature in the connection of all phenomena under certain exponents, the only business of which is to express the relation of time (in so far as it contains all existence in itself) to the unity of apperception, which can exist in synthesis only according to rules.", "The combined expression of all is this  â€œAll phenomena exist in one nature, and must so exist, inasmuch as without this Ã  priori unity, no unity of experience, and consequently no determination of objects in experience, is possible.â€  As regards the mode of proof which we have employed in treating of these transcendental laws of nature, and the peculiar character of we must make one remark, which will at the same time be important as a guide in every other attempt to demonstrate the truth of intellectual and likewise synthetical propositions Ã  priori.", "Had we endeavoured to prove these analogies dogmatically, that is, from conceptions; that is to say, had we employed this method in attempting to show that everything which exists, exists only in that which is permanentâ€that every thing or event presupposes the existence of something in a preceding state, upon which it follows in conformity with a ruleâ€lastly, that in the manifold, which is coexistent, the states coexist in connection with each other according to a rule, all our labour would have been utterly in vain.", "For more conceptions of things, analyse them as we may, cannot enable us to conclude from the existence of one object to the existence of another.", "What other course was left for us to pursue?", "This only, to demonstrate the possibility of experience as a cognition in which at last all objects must be capable of being presented to us, if the representation of them is to possess any objective reality.", "Now in this third, this mediating term, the essential form of which consists in the synthetical unity of the apperception of all phenomena, we found Ã  priori conditions of the universal and necessary determination as to time of all existences in the world of phenomena, without which the empirical determination thereof as to time would itself be impossible, and we also discovered rules of synthetical unity Ã  priori, by means of which we could anticipate experience.", "For want of this method, and from the fancy that it was possible to discover a dogmatical proof of the synthetical propositions which are requisite in the empirical employment of the understanding, has it happened that a proof of the principle of sufficient reason has been so often attempted, and always in vain.", "The other two analogies nobody has ever thought of, although they have always been silently employed by the mind,[34] because the guiding thread furnished by the categories was wanting, the guide which alone can enable us to discover every hiatus, both in the system of conceptions and of principles.", "[34] The unity of the universe, in which all phenomena to be  connected, is evidently a mere consequence of the admitted principle  of the community of all substances which are coexistent.", "For were  substances isolated, they could not as parts constitute a whole, and  were their connection (reciprocal action of the manifold) not  necessary from the very fact of coexistence, we could not conclude  from the fact of the latter as a merely ideal relation to the former  as a real one.", "We have, however, shown in its place that community is  the proper ground of the possibility of an empirical cognition of  coexistence, and that we may therefore properly reason from the latter  to the former as its condition.", "4.", "THE POSTULATES OF EMPIRICAL THOUGHT.", "1.", "That which agrees with the formal conditions (intuition and conception) of experience, is possible.", "2.", "That which coheres with the material conditions of experience (sensation), is real.", "3.", "That whose coherence with the real is determined according to universal conditions of experience is (exists) necessary.", "Explanation.", "The categories of modality possess this peculiarity, that they do not in the least determine the object, or enlarge the conception to which they are annexed as predicates, but only express its relation to the faculty of cognition.", "Though my conception of a thing is in itself complete, I am still entitled to ask whether the object of it is merely possible, or whether it is also real, or, if the latter, whether it is also necessary.", "But hereby the object itself is not more definitely determined in thought, but the question is only in what relation it, including all its determinations, stands to the understanding and its employment in experience, to the empirical faculty of judgement, and to the reason of its application to experience.", "For this very reason, too, the categories of modality are nothing more than explanations of the conceptions of possibility, reality, and necessity, as employed in experience, and at the same time, restrictions of all the categories to empirical use alone, not authorizing the transcendental employment of them.", "For if they are to have something more than a merely logical significance, and to be something more than a mere analytical expression of the form of thought, and to have a relation to things and their possibility, reality, or necessity, they must concern possible experience and its synthetical unity, in which alone objects of cognition can be given.", "The postulate of the possibility of things requires also, that the conception of the things agree with the formal conditions of our experience in general.", "But this, that is to say, the objective form of experience, contains all the kinds of synthesis which are requisite for the cognition of objects.", "A conception which contains a synthesis must be regarded as empty and, without reference to an object, if its synthesis does not belong to experienceâ€either as borrowed from it, and in this case it is called an empirical conception, or such as is the ground and Ã  priori condition of experience (its form), and in this case it is a pure conception, a conception which nevertheless belongs to experience, inasmuch as its object can be found in this alone.", "For where shall we find the criterion or character of the possibility of an object which is cogitated by means of an Ã  priori synthetical conception, if not in the synthesis which constitutes the form of empirical cognition of objects?", "That in such a conception no contradiction exists is indeed a necessary logical condition, but very far from being sufficient to establish the objective reality of the conception, that is, the possibility of such an object as is thought in the conception.", "Thus, in the conception of a figure which is contained within two straight lines, there is no contradiction, for the conceptions of two straight lines and of their junction contain no negation of a figure.", "The impossibility in such a case does not rest upon the conception in itself, but upon the construction of it in space, that is to say, upon the conditions of space and its determinations.", "But these have themselves objective reality, that is, they apply to possible things, because they contain Ã  priori the form of experience in general.", "And now we shall proceed to point out the extensive utility and influence of this postulate of possibility.", "When I represent to myself a thing that is permanent, so that everything in it which changes belongs merely to its state or condition, from such a conception alone I never can cognize that such a thing is possible.", "Or, if I represent to myself something which is so constituted that, when it is posited, something else follows always and infallibly, my thought contains no self contradiction; but whether such a property as causality is to be found in any possible thing, my thought alone affords no means of judging.", "Finally, I can represent to myself different things (substances) which are so constituted that the state or condition of one causes a change in the state of the other, and reciprocally; but whether such a relation is a property of things cannot be perceived from these conceptions, which contain a merely arbitrary synthesis.", "Only from the fact, therefore, that these conceptions express Ã  priori the relations of perceptions in every experience, do we know that they possess objective reality, that is, transcendental truth; and that independent of experience, though not independent of all relation to form of an experience in general and its synthetical unity, in which alone objects can be empirically cognized.", "But when we fashion to ourselves new conceptions of substances, forces, action, and reaction, from the material presented to us by perception, without following the example of experience in their connection, we create mere chimeras, of the possibility of which we cannot discover any criterion, because we have not taken experience for our instructress, though we have borrowed the conceptions from her.", "Such fictitious conceptions derive their character of possibility not, like the categories, Ã  priori, as conceptions on which all experience depends, but only, Ã  posteriori, as conceptions given by means of experience itself, and their possibility must either be cognized Ã  posteriori and empirically, or it cannot be cognized at all.", "A substance which is permanently present in space, yet without filling it (like that tertium quid between matter and the thinking subject which some have tried to introduce into metaphysics), or a peculiar fundamental power of the mind of intuiting the future by anticipation (instead of merely inferring from past and present events), or, finally, a power of the mind to place itself in community of thought with other men, however distant they may beâ€these are conceptions the possibility of which has no ground to rest upon.", "For they are not based upon experience and its known laws; and, without experience, they are a merely arbitrary conjunction of thoughts, which, though containing no internal contradiction, has no claim to objective reality, neither, consequently, to the possibility of such an object as is thought in these conceptions.", "As far as concerns reality, it is self evident that we cannot cogitate such a possibility in concreto without the aid of experience; because reality is concerned only with sensation, as the matter of experience, and not with the form of thought, with which we can no doubt indulge in shaping fancies.", "But I pass by everything which derives its possibility from reality in experience, and I purpose treating here merely of the possibility of things by means of Ã  priori conceptions.", "I maintain, then, that the possibility of things is not derived from such conceptions per se, but only when considered as formal and objective conditions of an experience in general.", "It seems, indeed, as if the possibility of a triangle could be cognized from the conception of it alone (which is certainly independent of experience); for we can certainly give to the conception a corresponding object completely Ã  priori, that is to say, we can construct it.", "But as a triangle is only the form of an object, it must remain a mere product of the imagination, and the possibility of the existence of an object corresponding to it must remain doubtful, unless we can discover some other ground, unless we know that the figure can be cogitated under the conditions upon which all objects of experience rest.", "Now, the facts that space is a formal condition Ã  priori of external experience, that the formative synthesis, by which we construct a triangle in imagination, is the very same as that we employ in the apprehension of a phenomenon for the purpose of making an empirical conception of it, are what alone connect the notion of the possibility of such a thing, with the conception of it.", "In the same manner, the possibility of continuous quantities, indeed of quantities in general, for the conceptions of them are without exception synthetical, is never evident from the conceptions in themselves, but only when they are considered as the formal conditions of the determination of objects in experience.", "And where, indeed, should we look for objects to correspond to our conceptions, if not in experience, by which alone objects are presented to us?", "It is, however, true that without antecedent experience we can cognize and characterize the possibility of things, relatively to the formal conditions, under which something is determined in experience as an object, consequently, completely Ã  priori.", "But still this is possible only in relation to experience and within its limits.", "The postulate concerning the cognition of the reality of things requires perception, consequently conscious sensation, not indeed immediately, that is, of the object itself, whose existence is to be cognized, but still that the object have some connection with a real perception, in accordance with the analogies of experience, which exhibit all kinds of real connection in experience.", "From the mere conception of a thing it is impossible to conclude its existence.", "For, let the conception be ever so complete, and containing a statement of all the determinations of the thing, the existence of it has nothing to do with all this, but only with thew question whether such a thing is given, so that the perception of it can in every case precede the conception.", "For the fact that the conception of it precedes the perception, merely indicates the possibility of its existence; it is perception which presents matter to the conception, that is the sole criterion of reality.", "Prior to the perception of the thing, however, and therefore comparatively Ã  priori, we are able to cognize its existence, provided it stands in connection with some perceptions according to the principles of the empirical conjunction of these, that is, in conformity with the analogies of perception.", "For, in this case, the existence of the supposed thing is connected with our perception in a possible experience, and we are able, with the guidance of these analogies, to reason in the series of possible perceptions from a thing which we do really perceive to the thing we do not perceive.", "Thus, we cognize the existence of a magnetic matter penetrating all bodies from the perception of the attraction of the steel filings by the magnet, although the constitution of our organs renders an immediate perception of this matter impossible for us.", "For, according to the laws of sensibility and the connected context of our perceptions, we should in an experience come also on an immediate empirical intuition of this matter, if our senses were more acuteâ€but this obtuseness has no influence upon and cannot alter the form of possible experience in general.", "Our knowledge of the existence of things reaches as far as our perceptions, and what may be inferred from them according to empirical laws, extend.", "If we do not set out from experience, or do not proceed according to the laws of the empirical connection of phenomena, our pretensions to discover the existence of a thing which we do not immediately perceive are vain.", "Idealism, however, brings forward powerful objections to these rules for proving existence mediately.", "This is, therefore, the proper place for its refutation.", "REFUTATION OF IDEALISM.", "Idealismâ€I mean material idealismâ€is the theory which declares the existence of objects in space without us to be either () doubtful and indemonstrable, or (2) false and impossible.", "The first is the problematical idealism of Descartes, who admits the undoubted certainty of only one empirical assertion (assertio), to wit, â€œI am.â€ The second is the dogmatical idealism of Berkeley, who maintains that space, together with all the objects of which it is the inseparable condition, is a thing which is in itself impossible, and that consequently the objects in space are mere products of the imagination.", "The dogmatical theory of idealism is unavoidable, if we regard space as a property of things in themselves; for in that case it is, with all to which it serves as condition, a nonentity.", "But the foundation for this kind of idealism we have already destroyed in the transcendental Ã¦sthetic.", "Problematical idealism, which makes no such assertion, but only alleges our incapacity to prove the existence of anything besides ourselves by means of immediate experience, is a theory rational and evidencing a thorough and philosophical mode of thinking, for it observes the rule not to form a decisive judgement before sufficient proof be shown.", "The desired proof must therefore demonstrate that we have experience of external things, and not mere fancies.", "For this purpose, we must prove, that our internal and, to Descartes, indubitable experience is itself possible only under the previous assumption of external experience.", "THEOREM.", "The simple but empirically determined consciousness of my own existence proves the existence of external objects in space.", "PROOF  I am conscious of my own existence as determined in time.", "All determination in regard to time presupposes the existence of something permanent in perception.", "But this permanent something cannot be something in me, for the very reason that my existence in time is itself determined by this permanent something.", "It follows that the perception of this permanent existence is possible only through a thing without me and not through the mere representation of a thing without me.", "Consequently, the determination of my existence in time is possible only through the existence of real things external to me.", "Now, consciousness in time is necessarily connected with the consciousness of the possibility of this determination in time.", "Hence it follows that consciousness in time is necessarily connected also with the existence of things without me, inasmuch as the existence of these things is the condition of determination in time.", "That is to say, the consciousness of my own existence is at the same time an immediate consciousness of the existence of other things without me.", "Remark I. The reader will observe, that in the foregoing proof the game which idealism plays is retorted upon itself, and with more justice.", "It assumed that the only immediate experience is internal and that from this we can only infer the existence of external things.", "But, as always happens, when we reason from given effects to determined causes, idealism has reasoned with too much haste and uncertainty, for it is quite possible that the cause of our representations may lie in ourselves, and that we ascribe it falsely to external things.", "But our proof shows that external experience is properly immediate,[35] that only by virtue of itâ€not, indeed, the consciousness of our own existence, but certainly the determination of our existence in time, that is, internal experienceâ€is possible.", "It is true, that the representation â€œI am,â€ which is the expression of the consciousness which can accompany all my thoughts, is that which immediately includes the existence of a subject.", "But in this representation we cannot find any knowledge of the subject, and therefore also no empirical knowledge, that is, experience.", "For experience contains, in addition to the thought of something existing, intuition, and in this case it must be internal intuition, that is, time, in relation to which the subject must be determined.", "But the existence of external things is absolutely requisite for this purpose, so that it follows that internal experience is itself possible only mediately and through external experience.", "[35] The immediate consciousness of the existence of external things  is, in the preceding theorem, not presupposed, but proved, by the  possibility of this consciousness understood by us or not.", "The  question as to the possibility of it would stand thus  â€œHave we an  internal sense, but no external sense, and is our belief in external  perception a mere delusion?â€ But it is evident that, in order merely  to fancy to ourselves anything as external, that is, to present it to  the sense in intuition we must already possess an external sense, and  must thereby distinguish immediately the mere receptivity of an  external intuition from the spontaneity which characterizes every act  of imagination.", "For merely to imagine also an external sense, would  annihilate the faculty of intuition itself which is to be determined  by the imagination.", "Remark II.", "Now with this view all empirical use of our faculty of cognition in the determination of time is in perfect accordance.", "Its truth is supported by the fact that it is possible to perceive a determination of time only by means of a change in external relations (motion) to the permanent in space (for example, we become aware of the sunâ€™s motion by observing the changes of his relation to the objects of this earth).", "But this is not all.", "We find that we possess nothing permanent that can correspond and be submitted to the conception of a substance as intuition, except matter.", "This idea of permanence is not itself derived from external experience, but is an Ã  priori necessary condition of all determination of time, consequently also of the internal sense in reference to our own existence, and that through the existence of external things.", "In the representation â€œI,â€ the consciousness of myself is not an intuition, but a merely intellectual representation produced by the spontaneous activity of a thinking subject.", "It follows, that this â€œiâ€ has not any predicate of intuition, which, in its character of permanence, could serve as correlate to the determination of time in the internal senseâ€in the same way as impenetrability is the correlate of matter as an empirical intuition.", "Remark III.", "From the fact that the existence of external things is a necessary condition of the possibility of a determined consciousness of ourselves, it does not follow that every intuitive representation of external things involves the existence of these things, for their representations may very well be the mere products of the imagination (in dreams as well as in madness); though, indeed, these are themselves created by the reproduction of previous external perceptions, which, as has been shown, are possible only through the reality of external objects.", "The sole aim of our remarks has, however, been to prove that internal experience in general is possible only through external experience in general.", "Whether this or that supposed experience be purely imaginary must be discovered from its particular determinations and by comparing these with the criteria of all real experience.", "Finally, as regards the third postulate, it applies to material necessity in existence, and not to merely formal and logical necessity in the connection of conceptions.", "Now as we cannot cognize completely Ã  priori the existence of any object of sense, though we can do so comparatively Ã  priori, that is, relatively to some other previously given existenceâ€a cognition, however, which can only be of such an existence as must be contained in the complex of experience, of which the previously given perception is a partâ€the necessity of existence can never be cognized from conceptions, but always, on the contrary, from its connection with that which is an object of perception.", "But the only existence cognized, under the condition of other given phenomena, as necessary, is the existence of effects from given causes in conformity with the laws of causality.", "It is consequently not the necessity of the existence of things (as substances), but the necessity of the state of things that we cognize, and that not immediately, but by means of the existence of other states given in perception, according to empirical laws of causality.", "Hence it follows that the criterion of necessity is to be found only in the law of possible experienceâ€that everything which happens is determined Ã  priori in the phenomenon by its cause.", "Thus we cognize only the necessity of effects in nature, the causes of which are given us.", "Moreover, the criterion of necessity in existence possesses no application beyond the field of possible experience, and even in this it is not valid of the existence of things as substances, because these can never be considered as empirical effects, or as something that happens and has a beginning.", "Necessity, therefore, regards only the relations of phenomena according to the dynamical law of causality, and the possibility grounded thereon, of reasoning from some given existence (of a cause) Ã  priori to another existence (of an effect).", "â€œEverything that happens is hypothetically necessary,â€ is a principle which subjects the changes that take place in the world to a law, that is, to a rule of necessary existence, without which nature herself could not possibly exist.", "Hence the proposition, â€œNothing happens by blind chance (in mundo non datur casus),â€ is an Ã  priori law of nature.", "The case is the same with the proposition, â€œNecessity in nature is not blind,â€ that is, it is conditioned, consequently intelligible necessity (non datur fatum).", "Both laws subject the play of change to â€œa nature of things (as phenomena),â€ or, which is the same thing, to the unity of the understanding, and through the understanding alone can changes belong to an experience, as the synthetical unity of phenomena.", "Both belong to the class of dynamical principles.", "The former is properly a consequence of the principle of causalityâ€one of the analogies of experience.", "The latter belongs to the principles of modality, which to the determination of causality adds the conception of necessity, which is itself, however, subject to a rule of the understanding.", "The principle of continuity forbids any leap in the series of phenomena regarded as changes (in mundo non datur saltus); and likewise, in the complex of all empirical intuitions in space, any break or hiatus between two phenomena (non datur hiatus)â€for we can so express the principle, that experience can admit nothing which proves the existence of a vacuum, or which even admits it as a part of an empirical synthesis.", "For, as regards a vacuum or void, which we may cogitate as out and beyond the field of possible experience (the world), such a question cannot come before the tribunal of mere understanding, which decides only upon questions that concern the employment of given phenomena for the construction of empirical cognition.", "It is rather a problem for ideal reason, which passes beyond the sphere of a possible experience and aims at forming a judgement of that which surrounds and circumscribes it, and the proper place for the consideration of it is the transcendental dialectic.", "These four propositions, â€œIn mundo non datur hiatus, non datur saltus, non datur casus, non datur fatum,â€ as well as all principles of transcendental origin, we could very easily exhibit in their proper order, that is, in conformity with the order of the categories, and assign to each its proper place.", "But the already practised reader will do this for himself, or discover the clue to such an arrangement.", "But the combined result of all is simply this, to admit into the empirical synthesis nothing which might cause a break in or be foreign to the understanding and the continuous connection of all phenomena, that is, the unity of the conceptions of the understanding.", "For in the understanding alone is the unity of experience, in which all perceptions must have their assigned place, possible.", "Whether the field of possibility be greater than that of reality, and whether the field of the latter be itself greater than that of necessity, are interesting enough questions, and quite capable of synthetic solution, questions, however, which come under the jurisdiction of reason alone.", "For they are tantamount to asking whether all things as phenomena do without exception belong to the complex and connected whole of a single experience, of which every given perception is a part which therefore cannot be conjoined with any other phenomenaâ€or, whether my perceptions can belong to more than one possible experience?", "The understanding gives to experience, according to the subjective and formal conditions, of sensibility as well as of apperception, the rules which alone make this experience possible.", "Other forms of intuition besides those of space and time, other forms of understanding besides the discursive forms of thought, or of cognition by means of conceptions, we can neither imagine nor make intelligible to ourselves; and even if we could, they would still not belong to experience, which is the only mode of cognition by which objects are presented to us.", "Whether other perceptions besides those which belong to the total of our possible experience, and consequently whether some other sphere of matter exists, the understanding has no power to decide, its proper occupation being with the synthesis of that which is given.", "Moreover, the poverty of the usual arguments which go to prove the existence of a vast sphere of possibility, of which all that is real (every object of experience) is but a small part, is very remarkable.", "â€œAll real is possibleâ€; from this follows naturally, according to the logical laws of conversion, the particular proposition  â€œSome possible is real.â€ Now this seems to be equivalent to  â€œMuch is possible that is not real.â€ No doubt it does seem as if we ought to consider the sum of the possible to be greater than that of the real, from the fact that something must be added to the former to constitute the latter.", "But this notion of adding to the possible is absurd.", "For that which is not in the sum of the possible, and consequently requires to be added to it, is manifestly impossible.", "In addition to accordance with the formal conditions of experience, the understanding requires a connection with some perception; but that which is connected with this perception is real, even although it is not immediately perceived.", "But that another series of phenomena, in complete coherence with that which is given in perception, consequently more than one all embracing experience is possible, is an inference which cannot be concluded from the data given us by experience, and still less without any data at all.", "That which is possible only under conditions which are themselves merely possible, is not possible in any respect.", "And yet we can find no more certain ground on which to base the discussion of the question whether the sphere of possibility is wider than that of experience.", "I have merely mentioned these questions, that in treating of the conception of the understanding, there might be no omission of anything that, in the common opinion, belongs to them.", "In reality, however, the notion of absolute possibility (possibility which is valid in every respect) is not a mere conception of the understanding, which can be employed empirically, but belongs to reason alone, which passes the bounds of all empirical use of the understanding.", "We have, therefore, contented ourselves with a merely critical remark, leaving the subject to be explained in the sequel.", "Before concluding this fourth section, and at the same time the system of all principles of the pure understanding, it seems proper to mention the reasons which induced me to term the principles of modality postulates.", "This expression I do not here use in the sense which some more recent philosophers, contrary to its meaning with mathematicians, to whom the word properly belongs, attach to itâ€that of a proposition, namely, immediately certain, requiring neither deduction nor proof.", "For if, in the case of synthetical propositions, however evident they may be, we accord to them without deduction, and merely on the strength of their own pretensions, unqualified belief, all critique of the understanding is entirely lost; and, as there is no want of bold pretensions, which the common belief (though for the philosopher this is no credential) does not reject, the understanding lies exposed to every delusion and conceit, without the power of refusing its assent to those assertions, which, though illegitimate, demand acceptance as veritable axioms.", "When, therefore, to the conception of a thing an Ã  priori determination is synthetically added, such a proposition must obtain, if not a proof, at least a deduction of the legitimacy of its assertion.", "The principles of modality are, however, not objectively synthetical, for the predicates of possibility, reality, and necessity do not in the least augment the conception of that of which they are affirmed, inasmuch as they contribute nothing to the representation of the object.", "But as they are, nevertheless, always synthetical, they are so merely subjectively.", "That is to say, they have a reflective power, and apply to the conception of a thing, of which, in other respects, they affirm nothing, the faculty of cognition in which the conception originates and has its seat.", "So that if the conception merely agree with the formal conditions of experience, its object is called possible; if it is in connection with perception, and determined thereby, the object is real; if it is determined according to conceptions by means of the connection of perceptions, the object is called necessary.", "The principles of modality therefore predicate of a conception nothing more than the procedure of the faculty of cognition which generated it.", "Now a postulate in mathematics is a practical proposition which contains nothing but the synthesis by which we present an object to ourselves, and produce the conception of it, for exampleâ€â€œWith a given line, to describe a circle upon a plane, from a given pointâ€; and such a proposition does not admit of proof, because the procedure, which it requires, is exactly that by which alone it is possible to generate the conception of such a figure.", "With the same right, accordingly, can we postulate the principles of modality, because they do not augment[36] the conception of a thing but merely indicate the manner in which it is connected with the faculty of cognition.", "[36] When I think the reality of a thing, I do really think more than  the possibility, but not in the thing; for that can never contain more  in reality than was contained in its complete possibility.", "But while  the notion of possibility is merely the notion of a position of thing  in relation to the understanding (its empirical use), reality is the  conjunction of the thing with perception.", "GENERAL REMARK ON THE SYSTEM OF PRINCIPLES.", "It is very remarkable that we cannot perceive the possibility of a thing from the category alone, but must always have an intuition, by which to make evident the objective reality of the pure conception of the understanding.", "Take, for example, the categories of relation.", "How (1) a thing can exist only as a subject, and not as a mere determination of other things, that is, can be substance; or how (2), because something exists, some other thing must exist, consequently how a thing can be a cause; or how (3), when several things exist, from the fact that one of these things exists, some consequence to the others follows, and reciprocally, and in this way a community of substances can be possibleâ€are questions whose solution cannot be obtained from mere conceptions.", "The very same is the case with the other categories; for example, how a thing can be of the same sort with many others, that is, can be a quantity, and so on.", "So long as we have not intuition we cannot know whether we do really think an object by the categories, and where an object can anywhere be found to cohere with them, and thus the truth is established, that the categories are not in themselves cognitions, but mere forms of thought for the construction of cognitions from given intuitions.", "For the same reason is it true that from categories alone no synthetical proposition can be made.", "For example  â€œIn every existence there is substance,â€ that is, something that can exist only as a subject and not as mere predicate; or, â€œEverything is a quantityâ€â€to construct propositions such as these, we require something to enable us to go out beyond the given conception and connect another with it.", "For the same reason the attempt to prove a synthetical proposition by means of mere conceptions, for example  â€œEverything that exists contingently has a cause,â€ has never succeeded.", "We could never get further than proving that, without this relation to conceptions, we could not conceive the existence of the contingent, that is, could not Ã  priori through the understanding cognize the existence of such a thing; but it does not hence follow that this is also the condition of the possibility of the thing itself that is said to be contingent.", "If, accordingly; we look back to our proof of the principle of causality, we shall find that we were able to prove it as valid only of objects of possible experience, and, indeed, only as itself the principle of the possibility of experience, Consequently of the cognition of an object given in empirical intuition, and not from mere conceptions.", "That, however, the proposition  â€œEverything that is contingent must have a cause,â€ is evident to every one merely from conceptions, is not to be denied.", "But in this case the conception of the contingent is cogitated as involving not the category of modality (as that the non existence of which can be conceived) but that of relation (as that which can exist only as the consequence of something else), and so it is really an identical proposition  â€œThat which can exist only as a consequence, has a cause.â€ In fact, when we have to give examples of contingent existence, we always refer to changes, and not merely to the possibility of conceiving the opposite.", "[37] But change is an event, which, as such, is possible only through a cause, and considered per se its non existence is therefore possible, and we become cognizant of its contingency from the fact that it can exist only as the effect of a cause.", "Hence, if a thing is assumed to be contingent, it is an analytical proposition to say, it has a cause.", "[37] We can easily conceive the non existence of matter; but the  ancients did not thence infer its contingency.", "But even the  alternation of the existence and non existence of a given state in a  thing, in which all change consists, by no means proves the  contingency of that stateâ€the ground of proof being the reality of its  opposite.", "For example, a body is in a state of rest after motion, but  we cannot infer the contingency of the motion from the fact that the  former is the opposite of the latter.", "For this opposite is merely a  logical and not a real opposite to the other.", "If we wish to  demonstrate the contingency of the motion, what we ought to prove is  that, instead of the motion which took place in the preceding point of  time, it was possible for the body to have been then in rest, not,  that it is afterwards in rest; for in this case, both opposites are  perfectly consistent with each other.", "But it is still more remarkable that, to understand the possibility of things according to the categories and thus to demonstrate the objective reality of the latter, we require not merely intuitions, but external intuitions.", "If, for example, we take the pure conceptions of relation, we find that (1) for the purpose of presenting to the conception of substance something permanent in intuition corresponding thereto and thus of demonstrating the objective reality of this conception, we require an intuition (of matter) in space, because space alone is permanent and determines things as such, while time, and with it all that is in the internal sense, is in a state of continual flow; (2) in order to represent change as the intuition corresponding to the conception of causality, we require the representation of motion as change in space; in fact, it is through it alone that changes, the possibility of which no pure understanding can perceive, are capable of being intuited.", "Change is the connection of determinations contradictorily opposed to each other in the existence of one and the same thing.", "Now, how it is possible that out of a given state one quite opposite to it in the same thing should follow, reason without an example can not only not conceive, but cannot even make intelligible without intuition; and this intuition is the motion of a point in space; the existence of which in different spaces (as a consequence of opposite determinations) alone makes the intuition of change possible.", "For, in order to make even internal change cognitable, we require to represent time, as the form of the internal sense, figuratively by a line, and the internal change by the drawing of that line (motion), and consequently are obliged to employ external intuition to be able to represent the successive existence of ourselves in different states.", "The proper ground of this fact is that all change to be perceived as change presupposes something permanent in intuition, while in the internal sense no permanent intuition is to be found.", "Lastly, the objective possibility of the category of community cannot be conceived by mere reason, and consequently its objective reality cannot be demonstrated without an intuition, and that external in space.", "For how can we conceive the possibility of community, that is, when several substances exist, that some effect on the existence of the one follows from the existence of the other, and reciprocally, and therefore that, because something exists in the latter, something else must exist in the former, which could not be understood from its own existence alone?", "For this is the very essence of communityâ€which is inconceivable as a property of things which are perfectly isolated.", "Hence, Leibnitz, in attributing to the substances of the worldâ€as cogitated by the understanding aloneâ€a community, required the mediating aid of a divinity; for, from their existence, such a property seemed to him with justice inconceivable.", "But we can very easily conceive the possibility of community (of substances as phenomena) if we represent them to ourselves as in space, consequently in external intuition.", "For external intuition contains in itself Ã  priori formal external relations, as the conditions of the possibility of the real relations of action and reaction, and therefore of the possibility of community.", "With the same ease can it be demonstrated, that the possibility of things as quantities, and consequently the objective reality of the category of quantity, can be grounded only in external intuition, and that by its means alone is the notion of quantity appropriated by the internal sense.", "But I must avoid prolixity, and leave the task of illustrating this by examples to the readerâ€™s own reflection.", "The above remarks are of the greatest importance, not only for the confirmation of our previous confutation of idealism, but still more when the subject of self cognition by mere internal consciousness and the determination of our own nature without the aid of external empirical intuitions is under discussion, for the indication of the grounds of the possibility of such a cognition.", "The result of the whole of this part of the analytic of principles is, therefore  â€œAll principles of the pure understanding are nothing more than Ã  priori principles of the possibility of experience, and to experience alone do all Ã  priori synthetical propositions apply and relateâ€; indeed, their possibility itself rests entirely on this relation.", "Chapter III Of the Ground of the Division of all Objects into Phenomena and Noumena  We have now not only traversed the region of the pure understanding and carefully surveyed every part of it, but we have also measured it, and assigned to everything therein its proper place.", "But this land is an island, and enclosed by nature herself within unchangeable limits.", "It is the land of truth (an attractive word), surrounded by a wide and stormy ocean, the region of illusion, where many a fog bank, many an iceberg, seems to the mariner, on his voyage of discovery, a new country, and, while constantly deluding him with vain hopes, engages him in dangerous adventures, from which he never can desist, and which yet he never can bring to a termination.", "But before venturing upon this sea, in order to explore it in its whole extent, and to arrive at a certainty whether anything is to be discovered there, it will not be without advantage if we cast our eyes upon the chart of the land that we are about to leave, and to ask ourselves, firstly, whether we cannot rest perfectly contented with what it contains, or whether we must not of necessity be contented with it, if we can find nowhere else a solid foundation to build upon; and, secondly, by what title we possess this land itself, and how we hold it secure against all hostile claims?", "Although, in the course of our analytic, we have already given sufficient answers to these questions, yet a summary recapitulation of these solutions may be useful in strengthening our conviction, by uniting in one point the momenta of the arguments.", "We have seen that everything which the understanding draws from itself, without borrowing from experience, it nevertheless possesses only for the behoof and use of experience.", "The principles of the pure understanding, whether constitutive Ã  priori (as the mathematical principles), or merely regulative (as the dynamical), contain nothing but the pure schema, as it were, of possible experience.", "For experience possesses its unity from the synthetical unity which the understanding, originally and from itself, imparts to the synthesis of the imagination in relation to apperception, and in Ã  priori relation to and agreement with which phenomena, as data for a possible cognition, must stand.", "But although these rules of the understanding are not only Ã  priori true, but the very source of all truth, that is, of the accordance of our cognition with objects, and on this ground, that they contain the basis of the possibility of experience, as the ensemble of all cognition, it seems to us not enough to propound what is trueâ€we desire also to be told what we want to know.", "If, then, we learn nothing more by this critical examination than what we should have practised in the merely empirical use of the understanding, without any such subtle inquiry, the presumption is that the advantage we reap from it is not worth the labour bestowed upon it.", "It may certainly be answered that no rash curiosity is more prejudicial to the enlargement of our knowledge than that which must know beforehand the utility of this or that piece of information which we seek, before we have entered on the needful investigations, and before one could form the least conception of its utility, even though it were placed before our eyes.", "But there is one advantage in such transcendental inquiries which can be made comprehensible to the dullest and most reluctant learnerâ€this, namely, that the understanding which is occupied merely with empirical exercise, and does not reflect on the sources of its own cognition, may exercise its functions very well and very successfully, but is quite unable to do one thing, and that of very great importance, to determine, namely, the bounds that limit its employment, and to know what lies within or without its own sphere.", "This purpose can be obtained only by such profound investigations as we have instituted.", "But if it cannot distinguish whether certain questions lie within its horizon or not, it can never be sure either as to its claims or possessions, but must lay its account with many humiliating corrections, when it transgresses, as it unavoidably will, the limits of its own territory, and loses itself in fanciful opinions and blinding illusions.", "That the understanding, therefore, cannot make of its Ã  priori principles, or even of its conceptions, other than an empirical use, is a proposition which leads to the most important results.", "A transcendental use is made of a conception in a fundamental proposition or principle, when it is referred to things in general and considered as things in themselves; an empirical use, when it is referred merely to phenomena, that is, to objects of a possible experience.", "That the latter use of a conception is the only admissible one is evident from the reasons following.", "For every conception are requisite, firstly, the logical form of a conception (of thought) general; and, secondly, the possibility of presenting to this an object to which it may apply.", "Failing this latter, it has no sense, and utterly void of content, although it may contain the logical function for constructing a conception from certain data.", "Now, object cannot be given to a conception otherwise than by intuition, and, even if a pure intuition antecedent to the object is Ã  priori possible, this pure intuition can itself obtain objective validity only from empirical intuition, of which it is itself but the form.", "All conceptions, therefore, and with them all principles, however high the degree of their Ã  priori possibility, relate to empirical intuitions, that is, to data towards a possible experience.", "Without this they possess no objective validity, but are mere play of imagination or of understanding with images or notions.", "Let us take, for example, the conceptions of mathematics, and first in its pure intuitions.", "â€œSpace has three dimensionsâ€â€â€œBetween two points there can be only one straight line,â€ etc.", "Although all these principles, and the representation of the object with which this science occupies itself, are generated in the mind entirely Ã  priori, they would nevertheless have no significance if we were not always able to exhibit their significance in and by means of phenomena (empirical objects).", "Hence it is requisite that an abstract conception be made sensuous, that is, that an object corresponding to it in intuition be forthcoming, otherwise the conception remains, as we say, without sense, that is, without meaning.", "Mathematics fulfils this requirement by the construction of the figure, which is a phenomenon evident to the senses.", "The same science finds support and significance in number; this in its turn finds it in the fingers, or in counters, or in lines and points.", "The conception itself is always produced Ã  priori, together with the synthetical principles or formulas from such conceptions; but the proper employment of them, and their application to objects, can exist nowhere but in experience, the possibility of which, as regards its form, they contain Ã  priori.", "That this is also the case with all of the categories and the principles based upon them is evident from the fact that we cannot render intelligible the possibility of an object corresponding to them without having recourse to the conditions of sensibility, consequently, to the form of phenomena, to which, as their only proper objects, their use must therefore be confined, inasmuch as, if this condition is removed, all significance, that is, all relation to an object, disappears, and no example can be found to make it comprehensible what sort of things we ought to think under such conceptions.", "The conception of quantity cannot be explained except by saying that it is the determination of a thing whereby it can be cogitated how many times one is placed in it.", "But this â€œhow many timesâ€ is based upon successive repetition, consequently upon time and the synthesis of the homogeneous therein.", "Reality, in contradistinction to negation, can be explained only by cogitating a time which is either filled therewith or is void.", "If I leave out the notion of permanence (which is existence in all time), there remains in the conception of substance nothing but the logical notion of subject, a notion of which I endeavour to realize by representing to myself something that can exist only as a subject.", "But not only am I perfectly ignorant of any conditions under which this logical prerogative can belong to a thing, I can make nothing out of the notion, and draw no inference from it, because no object to which to apply the conception is determined, and we consequently do not know whether it has any meaning at all.", "In like manner, if I leave out the notion of time, in which something follows upon some other thing in conformity with a rule, I can find nothing in the pure category, except that there is a something of such a sort that from it a conclusion may be drawn as to the existence of some other thing.", "But in this case it would not only be impossible to distinguish between a cause and an effect, but, as this power to draw conclusions requires conditions of which I am quite ignorant, the conception is not determined as to the mode in which it ought to apply to an object.", "The so called principle  â€œEverything that is contingent has a cause,â€ comes with a gravity and self assumed authority that seems to require no support from without.", "But, I ask, what is meant by contingent?", "The answer is that the non existence of which is possible.", "But I should like very well to know by what means this possibility of non existence is to be cognized, if we do not represent to ourselves a succession in the series of phenomena, and in this succession an existence which follows a non existence, or conversely, consequently, change.", "For to say, that the non existence of a thing is not self contradictory is a lame appeal to a logical condition, which is no doubt a necessary condition of the existence of the conception, but is far from being sufficient for the real objective possibility of non existence.", "I can annihilate in thought every existing substance without self contradiction, but I cannot infer from this their objective contingency in existence, that is to say, the possibility of their non existence in itself.", "As regards the category of community, it may easily be inferred that, as the pure categories of substance and causality are incapable of a definition and explanation sufficient to determine their object without the aid of intuition, the category of reciprocal causality in the relation of substances to each other (commercium) is just as little susceptible thereof.", "Possibility, existence, and necessity nobody has ever yet been able to explain without being guilty of manifest tautology, when the definition has been drawn entirely from the pure understanding.", "For the substitution of the logical possibility of the conceptionâ€the condition of which is that it be not self contradictory, for the transcendental possibility of thingsâ€the condition of which is that there be an object corresponding to the conception, is a trick which can only deceive the inexperienced.", "[38]   [38] In one word, to none of these conceptions belongs a corresponding  object, and consequently their real possibility cannot be  demonstrated, if we take away sensuous intuitionâ€the only intuition  which we possessâ€and there then remains nothing but the logical  possibility, that is, the fact that the conception or thought is  possibleâ€which, however, is not the question; what we want to know  being, whether it relates to an object and thus possesses any meaning.", "It follows incontestably, that the pure conceptions of the understanding are incapable of transcendental, and must always be of empirical use alone, and that the principles of the pure understanding relate only to the general conditions of a possible experience, to objects of the senses, and never to things in general, apart from the mode in which we intuite them.", "Transcendental analytic has accordingly this important result, to wit, that the understanding is competent effect nothing Ã  priori, except the anticipation of the form of a possible experience in general, and that, as that which is not phenomenon cannot be an object of experience, it can never overstep the limits of sensibility, within which alone objects are presented to us.", "Its principles are merely principles of the exposition of phenomena, and the proud name of an ontology, which professes to present synthetical cognitions Ã  priori of things in general in a systematic doctrine, must give place to the modest title of analytic of the pure understanding.", "Thought is the act of referring a given intuition to an object.", "If the mode of this intuition is unknown to us, the object is merely transcendental, and the conception of the understanding is employed only transcendentally, that is, to produce unity in the thought of a manifold in general.", "Now a pure category, in which all conditions of sensuous intuitionâ€as the only intuition we possessâ€are abstracted, does not determine an object, but merely expresses the thought of an object in general, according to different modes.", "Now, to employ a conception, the function of judgement is required, by which an object is subsumed under the conception, consequently the at least formal condition, under which something can be given in intuition.", "Failing this condition of judgement (schema), subsumption is impossible; for there is in such a case nothing given, which may be subsumed under the conception.", "The merely transcendental use of the categories is therefore, in fact, no use at all and has no determined, or even, as regards its form, determinable object.", "Hence it follows that the pure category is incompetent to establish a synthetical Ã  priori principle, and that the principles of the pure understanding are only of empirical and never of transcendental use, and that beyond the sphere of possible experience no synthetical Ã  priori principles are possible.", "It may be advisable, therefore, to express ourselves thus.", "The pure categories, apart from the formal conditions of sensibility, have a merely transcendental meaning, but are nevertheless not of transcendental use, because this is in itself impossible, inasmuch as all the conditions of any employment or use of them (in judgements) are absent, to wit, the formal conditions of the subsumption of an object under these conceptions.", "As, therefore, in the character of pure categories, they must be employed empirically, and cannot be employed transcendentally, they are of no use at all, when separated from sensibility, that is, they cannot be applied to an object.", "They are merely the pure form of the employment of the understanding in respect of objects in general and of thought, without its being at the same time possible to think or to determine any object by their means.", "But there lurks at the foundation of this subject an illusion which it is very difficult to avoid.", "The categories are not based, as regards their origin, upon sensibility, like the forms of intuition, space, and time; they seem, therefore, to be capable of an application beyond the sphere of sensuous objects.", "But this is not the case.", "They are nothing but mere forms of thought, which contain only the logical faculty of uniting Ã  priori in consciousness the manifold given in intuition.", "Apart, then, from the only intuition possible for us, they have still less meaning than the pure sensuous forms, space and time, for through them an object is at least given, while a mode of connection of the manifold, when the intuition which alone gives the manifold is wanting, has no meaning at all.", "At the same time, when we designate certain objects as phenomena or sensuous existences, thus distinguishing our mode of intuiting them from their own nature as things in themselves, it is evident that by this very distinction we as it were place the latter, considered in this their own nature, although we do not so intuite them, in opposition to the former, or, on the other hand, we do so place other possible things, which are not objects of our senses, but are cogitated by the understanding alone, and call them intelligible existences (noumena).", "Now the question arises whether the pure conceptions of our understanding do possess significance in respect of these latter, and may possibly be a mode of cognizing them.", "But we are met at the very commencement with an ambiguity, which may easily occasion great misapprehension.", "The understanding, when it terms an object in a certain relation phenomenon, at the same time forms out of this relation a representation or notion of an object in itself, and hence believes that it can form also conceptions of such objects.", "Now as the understanding possesses no other fundamental conceptions besides the categories, it takes for granted that an object considered as a thing in itself must be capable of being thought by means of these pure conceptions, and is thereby led to hold the perfectly undetermined conception of an intelligible existence, a something out of the sphere of our sensibility, for a determinate conception of an existence which we can cognize in some way or other by means of the understanding.", "If, by the term noumenon, we understand a thing so far as it is not an object of our sensuous intuition, thus making abstraction of our mode of intuiting it, this is a noumenon in the negative sense of the word.", "But if we understand by it an object of a non sensuous intuition, we in this case assume a peculiar mode of intuition, an intellectual intuition, to wit, which does not, however, belong to us, of the very possibility of which we have no notionâ€and this is a noumenon in the positive sense.", "The doctrine of sensibility is also the doctrine of noumena in the negative sense, that is, of things which the understanding is obliged to cogitate apart from any relation to our mode of intuition, consequently not as mere phenomena, but as things in themselves.", "But the understanding at the same time comprehends that it cannot employ its categories for the consideration of things in themselves, because these possess significance only in relation to the unity of intuitions in space and time, and that they are competent to determine this unity by means of general Ã  priori connecting conceptions only on account of the pure ideality of space and time.", "Where this unity of time is not to be met with, as is the case with noumena, the whole use, indeed the whole meaning of the categories is entirely lost, for even the possibility of things to correspond to the categories is in this case incomprehensible.", "On this point, I need only refer the reader to what I have said at the commencement of the General Remark appended to the foregoing chapter.", "Now, the possibility of a thing can never be proved from the fact that the conception of it is not self contradictory, but only by means of an intuition corresponding to the conception.", "If, therefore, we wish to apply the categories to objects which cannot be regarded as phenomena, we must have an intuition different from the sensuous, and in this case the objects would be a noumena in the positive sense of the word.", "Now, as such an intuition, that is, an intellectual intuition, is no part of our faculty of cognition, it is absolutely impossible for the categories to possess any application beyond the limits of experience.", "It may be true that there are intelligible existences to which our faculty of sensuous intuition has no relation, and cannot be applied, but our conceptions of the understanding, as mere forms of thought for our sensuous intuition, do not extend to these.", "What, therefore, we call noumenon must be understood by us as such in a negative sense.", "If I take away from an empirical intuition all thought (by means of the categories), there remains no cognition of any object; for by means of mere intuition nothing is cogitated, and, from the existence of such or such an affection of sensibility in me, it does not follow that this affection or representation has any relation to an object without me.", "But if I take away all intuition, there still remains the form of thought, that is, the mode of determining an object for the manifold of a possible intuition.", "Thus the categories do in some measure really extend further than sensuous intuition, inasmuch as they think objects in general, without regard to the mode (of sensibility) in which these objects are given.", "But they do not for this reason apply to and determine a wider sphere of objects, because we cannot assume that such can be given, without presupposing the possibility of another than the sensuous mode of intuition, a supposition we are not justified in making.", "I call a conception problematical which contains in itself no contradiction, and which is connected with other cognitions as a limitation of given conceptions, but whose objective reality cannot be cognized in any manner.", "The conception of a noumenon, that is, of a thing which must be cogitated not as an object of sense, but as a thing in itself (solely through the pure understanding), is not self contradictory, for we are not entitled to maintain that sensibility is the only possible mode of intuition.", "Nay, further, this conception is necessary to restrain sensuous intuition within the bounds of phenomena, and thus to limit the objective validity of sensuous cognition; for things in themselves, which lie beyond its province, are called noumena for the very purpose of indicating that this cognition does not extend its application to all that the understanding thinks.", "But, after all, the possibility of such noumena is quite incomprehensible, and beyond the sphere of phenomena, all is for us a mere void; that is to say, we possess an understanding whose province does problematically extend beyond this sphere, but we do not possess an intuition, indeed, not even the conception of a possible intuition, by means of which objects beyond the region of sensibility could be given us, and in reference to which the understanding might be employed assertorically.", "The conception of a noumenon is therefore merely a limitative conception and therefore only of negative use.", "But it is not an arbitrary or fictitious notion, but is connected with the limitation of sensibility, without, however, being capable of presenting us with any positive datum beyond this sphere.", "The division of objects into phenomena and noumena, and of the world into a mundus sensibilis and intelligibilis is therefore quite inadmissible in a positive sense, although conceptions do certainly admit of such a division; for the class of noumena have no determinate object corresponding to them, and cannot therefore possess objective validity.", "If we abandon the senses, how can it be made conceivable that the categories (which are the only conceptions that could serve as conceptions for noumena) have any sense or meaning at all, inasmuch as something more than the mere unity of thought, namely, a possible intuition, is requisite for their application to an object?", "The conception of a noumenon, considered as merely problematical, is, however, not only admissible, but, as a limitative conception of sensibility, absolutely necessary.", "But, in this case, a noumenon is not a particular intelligible object for our understanding; on the contrary, the kind of understanding to which it could belong is itself a problem, for we cannot form the most distant conception of the possibility of an understanding which should cognize an object, not discursively by means of categories, but intuitively in a non sensuous intuition.", "Our understanding attains in this way a sort of negative extension.", "That is to say, it is not limited by, but rather limits, sensibility, by giving the name of noumena to things, not considered as phenomena, but as things in themselves.", "But it at the same time prescribes limits to itself, for it confesses itself unable to cognize these by means of the categories, and hence is compelled to cogitate them merely as an unknown something.", "I find, however, in the writings of modern authors, an entirely different use of the expressions, mundus sensibilis and intelligibilis, which quite departs from the meaning of the ancientsâ€an acceptation in which, indeed, there is to be found no difficulty, but which at the same time depends on mere verbal quibbling.", "According to this meaning, some have chosen to call the complex of phenomena, in so far as it is intuited, mundus sensibilis, but in so far as the connection thereof is cogitated according to general laws of thought, mundus intelligibilis.", "Astronomy, in so far as we mean by the word the mere observation of the starry heaven, may represent the former; a system of astronomy, such as the Copernican or Newtonian, the latter.", "But such twisting of words is a mere sophistical subterfuge, to avoid a difficult question, by modifying its meaning to suit our own convenience.", "To be sure, understanding and reason are employed in the cognition of phenomena; but the question is, whether these can be applied when the object is not a phenomenon and in this sense we regard it if it is cogitated as given to the understanding alone, and not to the senses.", "The question therefore is whether, over and above the empirical use of the understanding, a transcendental use is possible, which applies to the noumenon as an object.", "This question we have answered in the negative.", "When therefore we say, the senses represent objects as they appear, the understanding as they are, the latter statement must not be understood in a transcendental, but only in an empirical signification, that is, as they must be represented in the complete connection of phenomena, and not according to what they may be, apart from their relation to possible experience, consequently not as objects of the pure understanding.", "For this must ever remain unknown to us.", "Nay, it is also quite unknown to us whether any such transcendental or extraordinary cognition is possible under any circumstances, at least, whether it is possible by means of our categories.", "Understanding and sensibility, with us, can determine objects only in conjunction.", "If we separate them, we have intuitions without conceptions, or conceptions without intuitions; in both cases, representations, which we cannot apply to any determinate object.", "If, after all our inquiries and explanations, any one still hesitates to abandon the mere transcendental use of the categories, let him attempt to construct with them a synthetical proposition.", "It would, of course, be unnecessary for this purpose to construct an analytical proposition, for that does not extend the sphere of the understanding, but, being concerned only about what is cogitated in the conception itself, it leaves it quite undecided whether the conception has any relation to objects, or merely indicates the unity of thoughtâ€complete abstraction being made of the modi in which an object may be given  in such a proposition, it is sufficient for the understanding to know what lies in the conceptionâ€to what it applies is to it indifferent.", "The attempt must therefore be made with a synthetical and so called transcendental principle, for example  â€œEverything that exists, exists as substance,â€ or, â€œEverything that is contingent exists as an effect of some other thing, viz., of its cause.â€ Now I ask, whence can the understanding draw these synthetical propositions, when the conceptions contained therein do not relate to possible experience but to things in themselves (noumena)?", "Where is to be found the third term, which is always requisite PURE site in a synthetical proposition, which may connect in the same proposition conceptions which have no logical (analytical) connection with each other?", "The proposition never will be demonstrated, nay, more, the possibility of any such pure assertion never can be shown, without making reference to the empirical use of the understanding, and thus, ipso facto, completely renouncing pure and non sensuous judgement.", "Thus the conception of pure and merely intelligible objects is completely void of all principles of its application, because we cannot imagine any mode in which they might be given, and the problematical thought which leaves a place open for them serves only, like a void space, to limit the use of empirical principles, without containing at the same time any other object of cognition beyond their sphere.", "APPENDIX  Of the Equivocal Nature or Amphiboly of the Conceptions of Reflection from the Confusion of the Transcendental with the Empirical use of the Understanding.", "Reflection (reflexio) is not occupied about objects themselves, for the purpose of directly obtaining conceptions of them, but is that state of the mind in which we set ourselves to discover the subjective conditions under which we obtain conceptions.", "It is the consciousness of the relation of given representations to the different sources or faculties of cognition, by which alone their relation to each other can be rightly determined.", "The first question which occurs in considering our representations is to what faculty of cognition do they belong?", "To the understanding or to the senses?", "Many judgements are admitted to be true from mere habit or inclination; but, because reflection neither precedes nor follows, it is held to be a judgement that has its origin in the understanding.", "All judgements do not require examination, that is, investigation into the grounds of their truth.", "For, when they are immediately certain (for example  â€œBetween two points there can be only one straight lineâ€), no better or less mediate test of their truth can be found than that which they themselves contain and express.", "But all judgement, nay, all comparisons require reflection, that is, a distinction of the faculty of cognition to which the given conceptions belong.", "The act whereby I compare my representations with the faculty of cognition which originates them, and whereby I distinguish whether they are compared with each other as belonging to the pure understanding or to sensuous intuition, I term transcendental reflection.", "Now, the relations in which conceptions can stand to each other are those of identity and difference, agreement and opposition, of the internal and external, finally, of the determinable and the determining (matter and form).", "The proper determination of these relations rests on the question, to what faculty of cognition they subjectively belong, whether to sensibility or understanding?", "For, on the manner in which we solve this question depends the manner in which we must cogitate these relations.", "Before constructing any objective judgement, we compare the conceptions that are to be placed in the judgement, and observe whether there exists identity (of many representations in one conception), if a general judgement is to be constructed, or difference, if a particular; whether there is agreement when affirmative; and opposition when negative judgements are to be constructed, and so on.", "For this reason we ought to call these conceptions, conceptions of comparison (conceptus comparationis).", "But as, when the question is not as to the logical form, but as to the content of conceptions, that is to say, whether the things themselves are identical or different, in agreement or opposition, and so on, the things can have a twofold relation to our faculty of cognition, to wit, a relation either to sensibility or to the understanding, and as on this relation depends their relation to each other, transcendental reflection, that is, the relation of given representations to one or the other faculty of cognition, can alone determine this latter relation.", "Thus we shall not be able to discover whether the things are identical or different, in agreement or opposition, etc., from the mere conception of the things by means of comparison (comparatio), but only by distinguishing the mode of cognition to which they belong, in other words, by means of transcendental reflection.", "We may, therefore, with justice say, that logical reflection is mere comparison, for in it no account is taken of the faculty of cognition to which the given conceptions belong, and they are consequently, as far as regards their origin, to be treated as homogeneous; while transcendental reflection (which applies to the objects themselves) contains the ground of the possibility of objective comparison of representations with each other, and is therefore very different from the former, because the faculties of cognition to which they belong are not even the same.", "Transcendental reflection is a duty which no one can neglect who wishes to establish an Ã  priori judgement upon things.", "We shall now proceed to fulfil this duty, and thereby throw not a little light on the question as to the determination of the proper business of the understanding.", "1.", "Identity and Difference.", "When an object is presented to us several times, but always with the same internal determinations (qualitas et quantitas), it, if an object of pure understanding, is always the same, not several things, but only one thing (numerica identitas); but if a phenomenon, we do not concern ourselves with comparing the conception of the thing with the conception of some other, but, although they may be in this respect perfectly the same, the difference of place at the same time is a sufficient ground for asserting the numerical difference of these objects (of sense).", "Thus, in the case of two drops of water, we may make complete abstraction of all internal difference (quality and quantity), and, the fact that they are intuited at the same time in different places, is sufficient to justify us in holding them to be numerically different.", "Leibnitz regarded phenomena as things in themselves, consequently as intelligibilia, that is, objects of pure understanding (although, on account of the confused nature of their representations, he gave them the name of phenomena), and in this case his principle of the indiscernible (principium identatis indiscernibilium) is not to be impugned.", "But, as phenomena are objects of sensibility, and, as the understanding, in respect of them, must be employed empirically and not purely or transcendentally, plurality and numerical difference are given by space itself as the condition of external phenomena.", "For one part of space, although it may be perfectly similar and equal to another part, is still without it, and for this reason alone is different from the latter, which is added to it in order to make up a greater space.", "It follows that this must hold good of all things that are in the different parts of space at the same time, however similar and equal one may be to another.", "2.", "Agreement and Opposition.", "When reality is represented by the pure understanding (realitas noumenon), opposition between realities is incogitableâ€such a relation, that is, that when these realities are connected in one subject, they annihilate the effects of each other and may be represented in the formula 3  3 = 0.", "On the other hand, the real in a phenomenon (realitas phaenomenon) may very well be in mutual opposition, and, when united in the same subject, the one may completely or in part annihilate the effect or consequence of the other; as in the case of two moving forces in the same straight line drawing or impelling a point in opposite directions, or in the case of a pleasure counterbalancing a certain amount of pain.", "3.", "The Internal and External.", "In an object of the pure understanding, only that is internal which has no relation (as regards its existence) to anything different from itself.", "On the other hand, the internal determinations of a substantia phaenomenon in space are nothing but relations, and it is itself nothing more than a complex of mere relations.", "Substance in space we are cognizant of only through forces operative in it, either drawing others towards itself (attraction), or preventing others from forcing into itself (repulsion and impenetrability).", "We know no other properties that make up the conception of substance phenomenal in space, and which we term matter.", "On the other hand, as an object of the pure understanding, every substance must have internal determination and forces.", "But what other internal attributes of such an object can I think than those which my internal sense presents to me?", "That, to wit, which in either itself thought, or something analogous to it.", "Hence Leibnitz, who looked upon things as noumena, after denying them everything like external relation, and therefore also composition or combination, declared that all substances, even the component parts of matter, were simple substances with powers of representation, in one word, monads.", "4.", "Matter and Form.", "These two conceptions lie at the foundation of all other reflection, so inseparably are they connected with every mode of exercising the understanding.", "The former denotes the determinable in general, the second its determination, both in a transcendental sense, abstraction being made of every difference in that which is given, and of the mode in which it is determined.", "Logicians formerly termed the universal, matter, the specific difference of this or that part of the universal, form.", "In a judgement one may call the given conceptions logical matter (for the judgement), the relation of these to each other (by means of the copula), the form of the judgement.", "In an object, the composite parts thereof (essentialia) are the matter; the mode in which they are connected in the object, the form.", "In respect to things in general, unlimited reality was regarded as the matter of all possibility, the limitation thereof (negation) as the form, by which one thing is distinguished from another according to transcendental conceptions.", "The understanding demands that something be given (at least in the conception), in order to be able to determine it in a certain manner.", "Hence, in a conception of the pure understanding, the matter precedes the form, and for this reason Leibnitz first assumed the existence of things (monads) and of an internal power of representation in them, in order to found upon this their external relation and the community their state (that is, of their representations).", "Hence, with him, space and time were possibleâ€the former through the relation of substances, the latter through the connection of their determinations with each other, as causes and effects.", "And so would it really be, if the pure understanding were capable of an immediate application to objects, and if space and time were determinations of things in themselves.", "But being merely sensuous intuitions, in which we determine all objects solely as phenomena, the form of intuition (as a subjective property of sensibility) must antecede all matter (sensations), consequently space and time must antecede all phenomena and all data of experience, and rather make experience itself possible.", "But the intellectual philosopher could not endure that the form should precede the things themselves and determine their possibility; an objection perfectly correct, if we assume that we intuite things as they are, although with confused representation.", "But as sensuous intuition is a peculiar subjective condition, which is Ã  priori at the foundation of all perception, and the form of which is primitive, the form must be given per se, and so far from matter (or the things themselves which appear) lying at the foundation of experience (as we must conclude, if we judge by mere conceptions), the very possibility of itself presupposes, on the contrary, a given formal intuition (space and time).", "REMARK ON THE AMPHIBOLY OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF REFLECTION.", "Let me be allowed to term the position which we assign to a conception either in the sensibility or in the pure understanding, the transcendental place.", "In this manner, the appointment of the position which must be taken by each conception according to the difference in its use, and the directions for determining this place to all conceptions according to rules, would be a transcendental topic, a doctrine which would thoroughly shield us from the surreptitious devices of the pure understanding and the delusions which thence arise, as it would always distinguish to what faculty of cognition each conception properly belonged.", "Every conception, every title, under which many cognitions rank together, may be called a logical place.", "Upon this is based the logical topic of Aristotle, of which teachers and rhetoricians could avail themselves, in order, under certain titles of thought, to observe what would best suit the matter they had to treat, and thus enable themselves to quibble and talk with fluency and an appearance of profundity.", "Transcendental topic, on the contrary, contains nothing more than the above mentioned four titles of all comparison and distinction, which differ from categories in this respect, that they do not represent the object according to that which constitutes its conception (quantity, reality), but set forth merely the comparison of representations, which precedes our conceptions of things.", "But this comparison requires a previous reflection, that is, a determination of the place to which the representations of the things which are compared belong, whether, to wit, they are cogitated by the pure understanding, or given by sensibility.", "Conceptions may be logically compared without the trouble of inquiring to what faculty their objects belong, whether as noumena, to the understanding, or as phenomena, to sensibility.", "If, however, we wish to employ these conceptions in respect of objects, previous transcendental reflection is necessary.", "Without this reflection I should make a very unsafe use of these conceptions, and construct pretended synthetical propositions which critical reason cannot acknowledge and which are based solely upon a transcendental amphiboly, that is, upon a substitution of an object of pure understanding for a phenomenon.", "For want of this doctrine of transcendental topic, and consequently deceived by the amphiboly of the conceptions of reflection, the celebrated Leibnitz constructed an intellectual system of the world, or rather, believed himself competent to cognize the internal nature of things, by comparing all objects merely with the understanding and the abstract formal conceptions of thought.", "Our table of the conceptions of reflection gives us the unexpected advantage of being able to exhibit the distinctive peculiarities of his system in all its parts, and at the same time of exposing the fundamental principle of this peculiar mode of thought, which rested upon naught but a misconception.", "He compared all things with each other merely by means of conceptions, and naturally found no other differences than those by which the understanding distinguishes its pure conceptions one from another.", "The conditions of sensuous intuition, which contain in themselves their own means of distinction, he did not look upon as primitive, because sensibility was to him but a confused mode of representation and not any particular source of representations.", "A phenomenon was for him the representation of the thing in itself, although distinguished from cognition by the understanding only in respect of the logical formâ€the former with its usual want of analysis containing, according to him, a certain mixture of collateral representations in its conception of a thing, which it is the duty of the understanding to separate and distinguish.", "In one word, Leibnitz intellectualized phenomena, just as Locke, in his system of noogony (if I may be allowed to make use of such expressions), sensualized the conceptions of the understanding, that is to say, declared them to be nothing more than empirical or abstract conceptions of reflection.", "Instead of seeking in the understanding and sensibility two different sources of representations, which, however, can present us with objective judgements of things only in conjunction, each of these great men recognized but one of these faculties, which, in their opinion, applied immediately to things in themselves, the other having no duty but that of confusing or arranging the representations of the former.", "Accordingly, the objects of sense were compared by Leibnitz as things in general merely in the understanding.", "1st.", "He compares them in regard to their identity or differenceâ€as judged by the understanding.", "As, therefore, he considered merely the conceptions of objects, and not their position in intuition, in which alone objects can be given, and left quite out of sight the transcendental locale of these conceptionsâ€whether, that is, their object ought to be classed among phenomena, or among things in themselves, it was to be expected that he should extend the application of the principle of indiscernibles, which is valid solely of conceptions of things in general, to objects of sense (mundus phaenomenon), and that he should believe that he had thereby contributed in no small degree to extend our knowledge of nature.", "In truth, if I cognize in all its inner determinations a drop of water as a thing in itself, I cannot look upon one drop as different from another, if the conception of the one is completely identical with that of the other.", "But if it is a phenomenon in space, it has a place not merely in the understanding (among conceptions), but also in sensuous external intuition (in space), and in this case, the physical locale is a matter of indifference in regard to the internal determinations of things, and one place, B, may contain a thing which is perfectly similar and equal to another in a place, A, just as well as if the two things were in every respect different from each other.", "Difference of place without any other conditions, makes the plurality and distinction of objects as phenomena, not only possible in itself, but even necessary.", "Consequently, the above so called law is not a law of nature.", "It is merely an analytical rule for the comparison of things by means of mere conceptions.", "2nd.", "The principle  â€œRealities (as simple affirmations) never logically contradict each other,â€ is a proposition perfectly true respecting the relation of conceptions, but, whether as regards nature, or things in themselves (of which we have not the slightest conception), is without any the least meaning.", "For real opposition, in which A  B is = 0, exists everywhere, an opposition, that is, in which one reality united with another in the same subject annihilates the effects of the otherâ€a fact which is constantly brought before our eyes by the different antagonistic actions and operations in nature, which, nevertheless, as depending on real forces, must be called realitates phaenomena.", "General mechanics can even present us with the empirical condition of this opposition in an Ã  priori rule, as it directs its attention to the opposition in the direction of forcesâ€a condition of which the transcendental conception of reality can tell us nothing.", "Although M. Leibnitz did not announce this proposition with precisely the pomp of a new principle, he yet employed it for the establishment of new propositions, and his followers introduced it into their Leibnitzio Wolfian system of philosophy.", "According to this principle, for example, all evils are but consequences of the limited nature of created beings, that is, negations, because these are the only opposite of reality.", "(In the mere conception of a thing in general this is really the case, but not in things as phenomena.)", "In like manner, the upholders of this system deem it not only possible, but natural also, to connect and unite all reality in one being, because they acknowledge no other sort of opposition than that of contradiction (by which the conception itself of a thing is annihilated), and find themselves unable to conceive an opposition of reciprocal destruction, so to speak, in which one real cause destroys the effect of another, and the conditions of whose representation we meet with only in sensibility.", "3rd.", "The Leibnitzian monadology has really no better foundation than on this philosopherâ€™s mode of falsely representing the difference of the internal and external solely in relation to the understanding.", "Substances, in general, must have something inward, which is therefore free from external relations, consequently from that of composition also.", "The simpleâ€that which can be represented by a unitâ€is therefore the foundation of that which is internal in things in themselves.", "The internal state of substances cannot therefore consist in place, shape, contact, or motion, determinations which are all external relations, and we can ascribe to them no other than that whereby we internally determine our faculty of sense itself, that is to say, the state of representation.", "Thus, then, were constructed the monads, which were to form the elements of the universe, the active force of which consists in representation, the effects of this force being thus entirely confined to themselves.", "For the same reason, his view of the possible community of substances could not represent it but as a predetermined harmony, and by no means as a physical influence.", "For inasmuch as everything is occupied only internally, that is, with its own representations, the state of the representations of one substance could not stand in active and living connection with that of another, but some third cause operating on all without exception was necessary to make the different states correspond with one another.", "And this did not happen by means of assistance applied in each particular case (systema assistentiae), but through the unity of the idea of a cause occupied and connected with all substances, in which they necessarily receive, according to the Leibnitzian school, their existence and permanence, consequently also reciprocal correspondence, according to universal laws.", "4th.", "This philosopherâ€™s celebrated doctrine of space and time, in which he intellectualized these forms of sensibility, originated in the same delusion of transcendental reflection.", "If I attempt to represent by the mere understanding, the external relations of things, I can do so only by employing the conception of their reciprocal action, and if I wish to connect one state of the same thing with another state, I must avail myself of the notion of the order of cause and effect.", "And thus Leibnitz regarded space as a certain order in the community of substances, and time as the dynamical sequence of their states.", "That which space and time possess proper to themselves and independent of things, he ascribed to a necessary confusion in our conceptions of them, whereby that which is a mere form of dynamical relations is held to be a self existent intuition, antecedent even to things themselves.", "Thus space and time were the intelligible form of the connection of things (substances and their states) in themselves.", "But things were intelligible substances (substantiae noumena).", "At the same time, he made these conceptions valid of phenomena, because he did not allow to sensibility a peculiar mode of intuition, but sought all, even the empirical representation of objects, in the understanding, and left to sense naught but the despicable task of confusing and disarranging the representations of the former.", "But even if we could frame any synthetical proposition concerning things in themselves by means of the pure understanding (which is impossible), it could not apply to phenomena, which do not represent things in themselves.", "In such a case I should be obliged in transcendental reflection to compare my conceptions only under the conditions of sensibility, and so space and time would not be determinations of things in themselves, but of phenomena.", "What things may be in themselves, I know not and need not know, because a thing is never presented to me otherwise than as a phenomenon.", "I must adopt the same mode of procedure with the other conceptions of reflection.", "Matter is substantia phaenomenon.", "That in it which is internal I seek to discover in all parts of space which it occupies, and in all the functions and operations it performs, and which are indeed never anything but phenomena of the external sense.", "I cannot therefore find anything that is absolutely, but only what is comparatively internal, and which itself consists of external relations.", "The absolutely internal in matter, and as it should be according to the pure understanding, is a mere chimera, for matter is not an object for the pure understanding.", "But the transcendental object, which is the foundation of the phenomenon which we call matter, is a mere nescio quid, the nature of which we could not understand, even though someone were found able to tell us.", "For we can understand nothing that does not bring with it something in intuition corresponding to the expressions employed.", "If, by the complaint of being unable to perceive the internal nature of things, it is meant that we do not comprehend by the pure understanding what the things which appear to us may be in themselves, it is a silly and unreasonable complaint; for those who talk thus really desire that we should be able to cognize, consequently to intuite, things without senses, and therefore wish that we possessed a faculty of cognition perfectly different from the human faculty, not merely in degree, but even as regards intuition and the mode thereof, so that thus we should not be men, but belong to a class of beings, the possibility of whose existence, much less their nature and constitution, we have no means of cognizing.", "By observation and analysis of phenomena we penetrate into the interior of nature, and no one can say what progress this knowledge may make in time.", "But those transcendental questions which pass beyond the limits of nature, we could never answer, even although all nature were laid open to us, because we have not the power of observing our own mind with any other intuition than that of our internal sense.", "For herein lies the mystery of the origin and source of our faculty of sensibility.", "Its application to an object, and the transcendental ground of this unity of subjective and objective, lie too deeply concealed for us, who cognize ourselves only through the internal sense, consequently as phenomena, to be able to discover in our existence anything but phenomena, the non sensuous cause of which we at the same time earnestly desire to penetrate to.", "The great utility of this critique of conclusions arrived at by the processes of mere reflection consists in its clear demonstration of the nullity of all conclusions respecting objects which are compared with each other in the understanding alone, while it at the same time confirms what we particularly insisted on, namely, that, although phenomena are not included as things in themselves among the objects of the pure understanding, they are nevertheless the only things by which our cognition can possess objective reality, that is to say, which give us intuitions to correspond with our conceptions.", "When we reflect in a purely logical manner, we do nothing more than compare conceptions in our understanding, to discover whether both have the same content, whether they are self contradictory or not, whether anything is contained in either conception, which of the two is given, and which is merely a mode of thinking that given.", "But if I apply these conceptions to an object in general (in the transcendental sense), without first determining whether it is an object of sensuous or intellectual intuition, certain limitations present themselves, which forbid us to pass beyond the conceptions and render all empirical use of them impossible.", "And thus these limitations prove that the representation of an object as a thing in general is not only insufficient, but, without sensuous determination and independently of empirical conditions, self contradictory; that we must therefore make abstraction of all objects, as in logic, or, admitting them, must think them under conditions of sensuous intuition; that, consequently, the intelligible requires an altogether peculiar intuition, which we do not possess, and in the absence of which it is for us nothing; while, on the other hand phenomena cannot be objects in themselves.", "For, when I merely think things in general, the difference in their external relations cannot constitute a difference in the things themselves; on the contrary, the former presupposes the latter, and if the conception of one of two things is not internally different from that of the other, I am merely thinking the same thing in different relations.", "Further, by the addition of one affirmation (reality) to the other, the positive therein is really augmented, and nothing is abstracted or withdrawn from it; hence the real in things cannot be in contradiction with or opposition to itselfâ€and so on.", "The true use of the conceptions of reflection in the employment of the understanding has, as we have shown, been so misconceived by Leibnitz, one of the most acute philosophers of either ancient or modern times, that he has been misled into the construction of a baseless system of intellectual cognition, which professes to determine its objects without the intervention of the senses.", "For this reason, the exposition of the cause of the amphiboly of these conceptions, as the origin of these false principles, is of great utility in determining with certainty the proper limits of the understanding.", "It is right to say whatever is affirmed or denied of the whole of a conception can be affirmed or denied of any part of it (dictum de omni et nullo); but it would be absurd so to alter this logical proposition as to say whatever is not contained in a general conception is likewise not contained in the particular conceptions which rank under it; for the latter are particular conceptions, for the very reason that their content is greater than that which is cogitated in the general conception.", "And yet the whole intellectual system of Leibnitz is based upon this false principle, and with it must necessarily fall to the ground, together with all the ambiguous principles in reference to the employment of the understanding which have thence originated.", "Leibnitzâ€™s principle of the identity of indiscernibles or indistinguishables is really based on the presupposition that, if in the conception of a thing a certain distinction is not to be found, it is also not to be met with in things themselves; that, consequently, all things are completely identical (numero eadem) which are not distinguishable from each other (as to quality or quantity) in our conceptions of them.", "But, as in the mere conception of anything abstraction has been made of many necessary conditions of intuition, that of which abstraction has been made is rashly held to be non existent, and nothing is attributed to the thing but what is contained in its conception.", "The conception of a cubic foot of space, however I may think it, is in itself completely identical.", "But two cubic feet in space are nevertheless distinct from each other from the sole fact of their being in different places (they are numero diversa); and these places are conditions of intuition, wherein the object of this conception is given, and which do not belong to the conception, but to the faculty of sensibility.", "In like manner, there is in the conception of a thing no contradiction when a negative is not connected with an affirmative; and merely affirmative conceptions cannot, in conjunction, produce any negation.", "But in sensuous intuition, wherein reality (take for example, motion) is given, we find conditions (opposite directions)â€of which abstraction has been made in the conception of motion in generalâ€which render possible a contradiction or opposition (not indeed of a logical kind)â€and which from pure positives produce zero = 0.", "We are therefore not justified in saying that all reality is in perfect agreement and harmony, because no contradiction is discoverable among its conceptions.", "[39] According to mere conceptions, that which is internal is the substratum of all relations or external determinations.", "When, therefore, I abstract all conditions of intuition, and confine myself solely to the conception of a thing in general, I can make abstraction of all external relations, and there must nevertheless remain a conception of that which indicates no relation, but merely internal determinations.", "Now it seems to follow that in everything (substance) there is something which is absolutely internal and which antecedes all external determinations, inasmuch as it renders them possible; and that therefore this substratum is something which does not contain any external relations and is consequently simple (for corporeal things are never anything but relations, at least of their parts external to each other); and, inasmuch as we know of no other absolutely internal determinations than those of the internal sense, this substratum is not only simple, but also, analogously with our internal sense, determined through representations, that is to say, all things are properly monads, or simple beings endowed with the power of representation.", "Now all this would be perfectly correct, if the conception of a thing were the only necessary condition of the presentation of objects of external intuition.", "It is, on the contrary, manifest that a permanent phenomenon in space (impenetrable extension) can contain mere relations, and nothing that is absolutely internal, and yet be the primary substratum of all external perception.", "By mere conceptions I cannot think anything external, without, at the same time, thinking something internal, for the reason that conceptions of relations presuppose given things, and without these are impossible.", "But, as an intuition there is something (that is, space, which, with all it contains, consists of purely formal, or, indeed, real relations) which is not found in the mere conception of a thing in general, and this presents to us the substratum which could not be cognized through conceptions alone, I cannot say  because a thing cannot be represented by mere conceptions without something absolutely internal, there is also, in the things themselves which are contained under these conceptions, and in their intuition nothing external to which something absolutely internal does not serve as the foundation.", "For, when we have made abstraction of all the conditions of intuition, there certainly remains in the mere conception nothing but the internal in general, through which alone the external is possible.", "But this necessity, which is grounded upon abstraction alone, does not obtain in the case of things themselves, in so far as they are given in intuition with such determinations as express mere relations, without having anything internal as their foundation; for they are not things of a thing of which we can neither for they are not things in themselves, but only phenomena.", "What we cognize in matter is nothing but relations (what we call its internal determinations are but comparatively internal).", "But there are some self subsistent and permanent, through which a determined object is given.", "That I, when abstraction is made of these relations, have nothing more to think, does not destroy the conception of a thing as phenomenon, nor the conception of an object in abstracto, but it does away with the possibility of an object that is determinable according to mere conceptions, that is, of a noumenon.", "It is certainly startling to hear that a thing consists solely of relations; but this thing is simply a phenomenon, and cannot be cogitated by means of the mere categories  it does itself consist in the mere relation of something in general to the senses.", "In the same way, we cannot cogitate relations of things in abstracto, if we commence with conceptions alone, in any other manner than that one is the cause of determinations in the other; for that is itself the conception of the understanding or category of relation.", "But, as in this case we make abstraction of all intuition, we lose altogether the mode in which the manifold determines to each of its parts its place, that is, the form of sensibility (space); and yet this mode antecedes all empirical causality.", "[39] If any one wishes here to have recourse to the usual subterfuge,  and to say, that at least realitates noumena cannot be in opposition  to each other, it will be requisite for him to adduce an example of  this pure and non sensuous reality, that it may be understood whether  the notion represents something or nothing.", "But an example cannot be  found except in experience, which never presents to us anything more  than phenomena; and thus the proposition means nothing more than that  the conception which contains only affirmatives does not contain  anything negativeâ€a proposition nobody ever doubted.", "If by intelligible objects we understand things which can be thought by means of the pure categories, without the need of the schemata of sensibility, such objects are impossible.", "For the condition of the objective use of all our conceptions of understanding is the mode of our sensuous intuition, whereby objects are given; and, if we make abstraction of the latter, the former can have no relation to an object.", "And even if we should suppose a different kind of intuition from our own, still our functions of thought would have no use or signification in respect thereof.", "But if we understand by the term, objects of a non sensuous intuition, in respect of which our categories are not valid, and of which we can accordingly have no knowledge (neither intuition nor conception), in this merely negative sense noumena must be admitted.", "For this is no more than saying that our mode of intuition is not applicable to all things, but only to objects of our senses, that consequently its objective validity is limited, and that room is therefore left for another kind of intuition, and thus also for things that may be objects of it.", "But in this sense the conception of a noumenon is problematical, that is to say, it is the notion of that it that it is possible, nor that it is impossible, inasmuch as we do not know of any mode of intuition besides the sensuous, or of any other sort of conceptions than the categoriesâ€a mode of intuition and a kind of conception neither of which is applicable to a non sensuous object.", "We are on this account incompetent to extend the sphere of our objects of thought beyond the conditions of our sensibility, and to assume the existence of objects of pure thought, that is, of noumena, inasmuch as these have no true positive signification.", "For it must be confessed of the categories that they are not of themselves sufficient for the cognition of things in themselves and, without the data of sensibility, are mere subjective forms of the unity of the understanding.", "Thought is certainly not a product of the senses, and in so far is not limited by them, but it does not therefore follow that it may be employed purely and without the intervention of sensibility, for it would then be without reference to an object.", "And we cannot call a noumenon an object of pure thought; for the representation thereof is but the problematical conception of an object for a perfectly different intuition and a perfectly different understanding from ours, both of which are consequently themselves problematical.", "The conception of a noumenon is therefore not the conception of an object, but merely a problematical conception inseparably connected with the limitation of our sensibility.", "That is to say, this conception contains the answer to the question  â€œAre there objects quite unconnected with, and independent of, our intuition?â€â€a question to which only an indeterminate answer can be given.", "That answer is  â€œInasmuch as sensuous intuition does not apply to all things without distinction, there remains room for other and different objects.â€ The existence of these problematical objects is therefore not absolutely denied, in the absence of a determinate conception of them, but, as no category is valid in respect of them, neither must they be admitted as objects for our understanding.", "Understanding accordingly limits sensibility, without at the same time enlarging its own field.", "While, moreover, it forbids sensibility to apply its forms and modes to things in themselves and restricts it to the sphere of phenomena, it cogitates an object in itself, only, however, as a transcendental object, which is the cause of a phenomenon (consequently not itself a phenomenon), and which cannot be thought either as a quantity or as reality, or as substance (because these conceptions always require sensuous forms in which to determine an object)â€an object, therefore, of which we are quite unable to say whether it can be met with in ourselves or out of us, whether it would be annihilated together with sensibility, or, if this were taken away, would continue to exist.", "If we wish to call this object a noumenon, because the representation of it is non sensuous, we are at liberty to do so.", "But as we can apply to it none of the conceptions of our understanding, the representation is for us quite void, and is available only for the indication of the limits of our sensuous intuition, thereby leaving at the same time an empty space, which we are competent to fill by the aid neither of possible experience, nor of the pure understanding.", "The critique of the pure understanding, accordingly, does not permit us to create for ourselves a new field of objects beyond those which are presented to us as phenomena, and to stray into intelligible worlds; nay, it does not even allow us to endeavour to form so much as a conception of them.", "The specious error which leads to thisâ€and which is a perfectly excusable oneâ€lies in the fact that the employment of the understanding, contrary to its proper purpose and destination, is made transcendental, and objects, that is, possible intuitions, are made to regulate themselves according to conceptions, instead of the conceptions arranging themselves according to the intuitions, on which alone their own objective validity rests.", "Now the reason of this again is that apperception, and with it thought, antecedes all possible determinate arrangement of representations.", "Accordingly we think something in general and determine it on the one hand sensuously, but, on the other, distinguish the general and in abstracto represented object from this particular mode of intuiting it.", "In this case there remains a mode of determining the object by mere thought, which is really but a logical form without content, which, however, seems to us to be a mode of the existence of the object in itself (noumenon), without regard to intuition which is limited to our senses.", "Before ending this transcendental analytic, we must make an addition, which, although in itself of no particular importance, seems to be necessary to the completeness of the system.", "The highest conception, with which a transcendental philosophy commonly begins, is the division into possible and impossible.", "But as all division presupposes a divided conception, a still higher one must exist, and this is the conception of an object in generalâ€problematically understood and without its being decided whether it is something or nothing.", "As the categories are the only conceptions which apply to objects in general, the distinguishing of an object, whether it is something or nothing, must proceed according to the order and direction of the categories.", "1.", "To the categories of quantity, that is, the conceptions of all, many, and one, the conception which annihilates all, that is, the conception of none, is opposed.", "And thus the object of a conception, to which no intuition can be found to correspond, is = nothing.", "That is, it is a conception without an object (ens rationis), like noumena, which cannot be considered possible in the sphere of reality, though they must not therefore be held to be impossibleâ€or like certain new fundamental forces in matter, the existence of which is cogitable without contradiction, though, as examples from experience are not forthcoming, they must not be regarded as possible.", "2.", "Reality is something; negation is nothing, that is, a conception of the absence of an object, as cold, a shadow (nihil privativum).", "3.", "The mere form of intuition, without substance, is in itself no object, but the merely formal condition of an object (as phenomenon), as pure space and pure time.", "These are certainly something, as forms of intuition, but are not themselves objects which are intuited (ens imaginarium).", "4.", "The object of a conception which is self contradictory, is nothing, because the conception is nothingâ€is impossible, as a figure composed of two straight lines (nihil negativum).", "The table of this division of the conception of nothing (the corresponding division of the conception of something does not require special description) must therefore be arranged as

objects; or is it merely a subordinate faculty, whose duty it is to give a certain form to given cognitionsâ€a form which is called logical, and through which the cognitions of the understanding are subordinated to each other, and lower rules to higher (those, to wit, whose condition comprises in its sphere the condition of the others), in so far as this can be done by comparison?", "This is the question which we have at present to answer.", "Manifold variety of rules and unity of principles is a requirement of reason, for the purpose of bringing the understanding into complete accordance

not contain any ground of the possibility of cognizing or of determining them as such, but is merely a subjective law for the proper arrangement of the content of the understanding.", "The purpose of this law is, by a comparison of the conceptions of the understanding, to reduce them to the smallest possible number, although, at the same time, it does not justify us in demanding from objects themselves such a uniformity as might contribute to the convenience and the enlargement of the sphere of the understanding, or in expecting that it will itself thus receive from them objective validity.", "In one word, the question is  â€œdoes reason in itself, that is, does pure reason contain Ã  priori synthetical principles and rules, and what are those principles?â€  The formal and logical procedure of reason in syllogisms gives us sufficient information in regard to the ground on which the transcendental principle of reason in its pure synthetical cognition will rest.", "1.",

direct relation to the senses and their intuition, for the purpose of determining their objects.", "The unity of reason is therefore not the unity of a possible experience, but is essentially different from this unity, which is that of the understanding.", "That everything which happens has a cause, is not a principle cognized and prescribed by reason.", "This principle makes the unity of

long as the process can be continued, it is very manifest that the peculiar principle of reason in its logical use is to find for the conditioned cognition of the understanding the unconditioned whereby the unity of the former is completed.", "But this logical maxim cannot be a principle of pure reason, unless we admit that, if the conditioned is given, the whole series of conditions subordinated to one anotherâ€a series which is consequently itself unconditionedâ€is also given, that is, contained in the object and its connection.", "But this principle of pure reason is evidently synthetical; for, analytically, the conditioned certainly relates to some condition, but not to the unconditioned.", "From this principle also there must originate different synthetical propositions, of which the pure understanding is perfectly ignorant, for it has to do only with objects of a possible experience, the cognition and synthesis of which is always conditioned.", "The unconditioned, if it does really exist, must be especially considered in regard to the determinations which distinguish it from whatever is conditioned, and will thus afford us material for many Ã  priori synthetical propositions.", "The principles resulting from this highest principle of pure reason will, however, be transcendent in relation to phenomena, that is to say, it will be impossible to make any adequate empirical use of this principle.", "It is therefore completely different from all principles of the understanding, the use made of which is entirely immanent, their object and purpose being merely the possibility of experience.", "Now our duty in the transcendental dialectic is as follows.", "To discover whether the principle that the series of conditions (in the synthesis of phenomena, or of thought in general) extends to the unconditioned is objectively true, or not; what consequences result therefrom affecting the empirical use of the understanding, or rather whether there exists any such objectively valid proposition of reason, and whether it is not, on the contrary, a merely logical precept which directs us to ascend perpetually to still higher conditions, to approach completeness in the series of them, and thus to introduce into our cognition the highest possible unity of reason.", "We must ascertain, I say, whether this requirement of reason has not been regarded, by a misunderstanding, as a transcendental principle of pure reason, which postulates a thorough completeness in the series of conditions in objects themselves.", "We must show, moreover, the misconceptions and illusions that intrude into syllogisms, the major proposition of which pure reason has suppliedâ€a proposition which has perhaps more of the character of a petitio than of a postulatumâ€and that proceed from experience upwards to its conditions.", "The solution of these problems is our task in transcendental dialectic, which we are about to expose even at its source, that lies deep in human reason.", "We shall divide it into two parts, the first of which will treat of the transcendent conceptions of pure reason, the second of transcendent and dialectical syllogisms.", "TRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTICâ€BOOK Iâ€OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF PURE REASON.", "The conceptions of pure reasonâ€we do not here speak of the possibility of themâ€are not obtained by reflection, but by inference or conclusion.", "The conceptions of understanding are also cogitated Ã  priori antecedently to experience, and render it possible; but they contain nothing but the unity of reflection upon phenomena, in so far as these must necessarily belong to a possible empirical consciousness.", "Through them alone are cognition and the determination of an object possible.", "It is from them, accordingly, that we receive material for reasoning, and antecedently to them we possess no Ã  priori conceptions of objects from which they might be deduced, On the other hand, the sole basis of their objective reality consists in the necessity imposed on them, as containing the intellectual form of all experience, of restricting their application and influence to the sphere of experience.", "But the term, conception of reason, or rational conception, itself indicates that it does not confine itself within the limits of experience, because its object matter is a cognition, of which every empirical cognition is but a partâ€nay, the whole of possible experience may be itself but a part of itâ€a cognition to which no actual experience ever fully attains, although it does always pertain to it.", "The aim of rational conceptions is the comprehension, as that of the conceptions of understanding is the understanding of perceptions.", "If they contain the unconditioned, they relate to that to which all experience is subordinate, but which is never itself an object of experienceâ€that towards which reason tends in all its conclusions from experience, and by the standard of which it estimates the degree of their empirical use, but which is never itself an element in an empirical synthesis.", "If, notwithstanding, such conceptions possess objective validity, they may be called conceptus ratiocinati (conceptions legitimately concluded); in cases where they do not, they have been admitted on account of having the appearance of being correctly concluded, and may be called conceptus ratiocinantes (sophistical conceptions).", "But as this can only be sufficiently demonstrated in that part of our treatise which relates to the dialectical conclusions of reason, we shall omit any consideration of it in this place.", "As we called the pure conceptions of the understanding categories, we shall also distinguish those of pure reason by a new name and call them transcendental ideas.", "These terms, however, we must in the first place explain and justify.", "Section Iâ€Of Ideas in General  Despite the great wealth of words which European languages possess, the thinker finds himself often at a loss for an expression exactly suited to his conception, for want of which he is unable to make himself intelligible either to others or to himself.", "To coin new words is a pretension to legislation in language which is seldom successful; and, before recourse is taken to so desperate an expedient, it is advisable to examine the dead and learned languages, with the hope and the probability that we may there meet with some adequate expression of the notion we have in our minds.", "In this case, even if the original meaning of the word has become somewhat uncertain, from carelessness or want of caution on the part of the authors of it, it is always better to adhere to and confirm its proper meaningâ€even although it may be doubtful whether it was formerly used in exactly this senseâ€than to make our labour vain by want of sufficient care to render ourselves intelligible.", "For this reason, when it happens that there exists only a single word to express a certain conception, and this word, in its usual acceptation, is thoroughly adequate to the conception, the accurate distinction of which from related conceptions is of great importance, we ought not to employ the expression improvidently, or, for the sake of variety and elegance of style, use it as a synonym for other cognate words.", "It is our duty, on the contrary, carefully to preserve its peculiar signification, as otherwise it easily happens that when the attention of the reader is no longer particularly attracted to the expression, and it is lost amid the multitude of other words of very different import, the thought which it conveyed, and which it alone conveyed, is lost with it.", "Plato employed the expression idea in a way that plainly showed he meant by it something which is never derived from the senses, but which far transcends even the conceptions of the understanding (with which Aristotle occupied himself), inasmuch as in experience nothing perfectly corresponding to them could be found.", "Ideas are, according to him, archetypes of things themselves, and not merely keys to possible experiences, like the categories.", "In his view they flow from the highest reason, by which they have been imparted to human reason, which, however, exists no longer in its original state, but is obliged with great labour to recall by reminiscenceâ€which is called philosophyâ€the old but now sadly obscured ideas.", "I will not here enter upon any literary investigation of the sense which this sublime philosopher attached to this expression.", "I shall content myself with remarking that it is nothing unusual, in common conversation as well as in written works, by comparing the thoughts which an author has delivered upon a subject, to understand him better than he understood himself inasmuch as he may not have sufficiently determined his conception, and thus have sometimes spoken, nay even thought, in opposition to his own opinions.", "Plato perceived very clearly that our faculty of cognition has the feeling of a much higher vocation than that of merely spelling out phenomena according to synthetical unity, for the purpose of being able to read them as experience, and that our reason naturally raises itself to cognitions far too elevated to admit of the possibility of an object given by experience corresponding to themâ€cognitions which are nevertheless real, and are not mere phantoms of the brain.", "This philosopher found his ideas especially in all that is practical,[41] that is, which rests upon freedom, which in its turn ranks under cognitions that are the peculiar product of reason.", "He who would derive from experience the conceptions of virtue, who would make (as many have really done) that, which at best can but serve as an imperfectly illustrative example, a model for or the formation of a perfectly adequate idea on the subject, would in fact transform virtue into a nonentity changeable according to time and circumstance and utterly incapable of being employed as a rule.", "On the contrary, every one is conscious that, when any one is held up to him as a model of virtue, he compares this so called model with the true original which he possesses in his own mind and values him according to this standard.", "But this standard is the idea of virtue, in relation to which all possible objects of experience are indeed serviceable as examplesâ€proofs of the practicability in a certain degree of that which the conception of virtue demandsâ€but certainly not as archetypes.", "That the actions of man will never be in perfect accordance with all the requirements of the pure ideas of reason, does not prove the thought to be chimerical.", "For only through this idea are all judgements as to moral merit or demerit possible; it consequently lies at the foundation of every approach to moral perfection, however far removed from it the obstacles in human natureâ€indeterminable as to degreeâ€may keep us.", "[41] He certainly extended the application of his conception to  speculative cognitions also, provided they were given pure and  completely Ã  priori, nay, even to mathematics, although this science  cannot possess an object otherwhere than in Possible experience.", "I  cannot follow him in this, and as little can I follow him in his  mystical deduction of these ideas, or in his hypostatization of them;  although, in truth, the elevated and exaggerated language which he  employed in describing them is quite capable of an interpretation more  subdued and more in accordance with fact and the nature of things.", "The Platonic Republic has become proverbial as an exampleâ€and a striking oneâ€of imaginary perfection, such as can exist only in the brain of the idle thinker; and Brucker ridicules the philosopher for maintaining that a prince can never govern well, unless he is participant in the ideas.", "But we should do better to follow up this thought and, where this admirable thinker leaves us without assistance, employ new efforts to place it in clearer light, rather than carelessly fling it aside as useless, under the very miserable and pernicious pretext of impracticability.", "A constitution of the greatest possible human freedom according to laws, by which the liberty of every individual can consist with the liberty of every other (not of the greatest possible happiness, for this follows necessarily from the former), is, to say the least, a necessary idea, which must be placed at the foundation not only of the first plan of the constitution of a state, but of all its laws.", "And, in this, it not necessary at the outset to take account of the obstacles which lie in our wayâ€obstacles which perhaps do not necessarily arise from the character of human nature, but rather from the previous neglect of true ideas in legislation.", "For there is nothing more pernicious and more unworthy of a philosopher, than the vulgar appeal to a so called adverse experience, which indeed would not have existed, if those institutions had been established at the proper time and in accordance with ideas; while, instead of this, conceptions, crude for the very reason that they have been drawn from experience, have marred and frustrated all our better views and intentions.", "The more legislation and government are in harmony with this idea, the more rare do punishments become and thus it is quite reasonable to maintain, as Plato did, that in a perfect state no punishments at all would be necessary.", "Now although a perfect state may never exist, the idea is not on that account the less just, which holds up this maximum as the archetype or standard of a constitution, in order to bring legislative government always nearer and nearer to the greatest possible perfection.", "For at what precise degree human nature must stop in its progress, and how wide must be the chasm which must necessarily exist between the idea and its realization, are problems which no one can or ought to determineâ€and for this reason, that it is the destination of freedom to overstep all assigned limits between itself and the idea.", "But not only in that wherein human reason is a real causal agent and where ideas are operative causes (of actions and their objects), that is to say, in the region of ethics, but also in regard to nature herself, Plato saw clear proofs of an origin from ideas.", "A plant, and animal, the regular order of natureâ€probably also the disposition of the whole universeâ€give manifest evidence that they are possible only by means of and according to ideas; that, indeed, no one creature, under the individual conditions of its existence, perfectly harmonizes with the idea of the most perfect of its kindâ€just as little as man with the idea of humanity, which nevertheless he bears in his soul as the archetypal standard of his actions; that, notwithstanding, these ideas are in the highest sense individually, unchangeably, and completely determined, and are the original causes of things; and that the totality of connected objects in the universe is alone fully adequate to that idea.", "Setting aside the exaggerations of expression in the writings of this philosopher, the mental power exhibited in this ascent from the ectypal mode of regarding the physical world to the architectonic connection thereof according to ends, that is, ideas, is an effort which deserves imitation and claims respect.", "But as regards the principles of ethics, of legislation, and of religion, spheres in which ideas alone render experience possible, although they never attain to full expression therein, he has vindicated for himself a position of peculiar merit, which is not appreciated only because it is judged by the very empirical rules, the validity of which as principles is destroyed by ideas.", "For as regards nature, experience presents us with rules and is the source of truth, but in relation to ethical laws experience is the parent of illusion, and it is in the highest degree reprehensible to limit or to deduce the laws which dictate what I ought to do, from what is done.", "We must, however, omit the consideration of these important subjects, the development of which is in reality the peculiar duty and dignity of philosophy, and confine ourselves for the present to the more humble but not less useful task of preparing a firm foundation for those majestic edifices of moral science.", "For this foundation has been hitherto insecure from the many subterranean passages which reason in its confident but vain search for treasures has made in all directions.", "Our present duty is to make ourselves perfectly acquainted with the transcendental use made of pure reason, its principles and ideas, that we may be able properly to determine and value its influence and real worth.", "But before bringing these introductory remarks to a close, I beg those who really have philosophy at heartâ€and their number is but smallâ€if they shall find themselves convinced by the considerations following as well as by those above, to exert themselves to preserve to the expression idea its original signification, and to take care that it be not lost among those other expressions by which all sorts of representations are loosely designatedâ€that the interests of science may not thereby suffer.", "We are in no want of words to denominate adequately every mode of representation, without the necessity of encroaching upon terms which are proper to others.", "The following is a graduated list of them.", "The genus is representation in general (representatio).", "Under it stands representation with consciousness (perceptio).", "A perception which relates solely to the subject as a modification of its state, is a sensation (sensatio), an objective perception is a cognition (cognitio).", "A cognition is either an intuition or a conception (intuitus vel conceptus).", "The former has an immediate relation to the object and is singular and individual; the latter has but a mediate relation, by means of a characteristic mark which may be common to several things.", "A conception is either empirical or pure.", "A pure conception, in so far as it has its origin in the understanding alone, and is not the conception of a pure sensuous image, is called notio.", "A conception formed from notions, which transcends the possibility of experience, is an idea, or a conception of reason.", "To one who has accustomed himself to these distinctions, it must be quite intolerable to hear the representation of the colour red called an idea.", "It ought not even to be called a notion or conception of understanding.", "Section II.", "Of Transcendental Ideas  Transcendental analytic showed us how the mere logical form of our cognition can contain the origin of pure conceptions Ã  priori, conceptions which represent objects antecedently to all experience, or rather, indicate the synthetical unity which alone renders possible an empirical cognition of objects.", "The form of judgementsâ€converted into a conception of the synthesis of intuitionsâ€produced the categories which direct the employment of the understanding in experience.", "This consideration warrants us to expect that the form of syllogisms, when applied to synthetical unity of intuitions, following the rule of the categories, will contain the origin of particular Ã  priori conceptions, which we may call pure conceptions of reason or transcendental ideas, and which will determine the use of the understanding in the totality of experience according to principles.", "The function of reason in arguments consists in the universality of a cognition according to conceptions, and the syllogism itself is a judgement which is determined Ã  priori in the whole extent of its condition.", "The proposition  â€œCaius is mortal,â€ is one which may be obtained from experience by the aid of the understanding alone; but my wish is to find a conception which contains the condition under which the predicate of this judgement is givenâ€in this case, the conception of manâ€and after subsuming under this condition, taken in its whole extent (all men are mortal), I determine according to it the cognition of the object thought, and say  â€œCaius is mortal.â€  Hence, in the conclusion of a syllogism we restrict a predicate to a certain object, after having thought it in the major in its whole extent under a certain condition.", "This complete quantity of the extent in relation to such a condition is called universality (universalitas).", "To this corresponds totality (universitas) of conditions in the synthesis of intuitions.", "The transcendental conception of reason is therefore nothing else than the conception of the totality of the conditions of a given conditioned.", "Now as the unconditioned alone renders possible totality of conditions, and, conversely, the totality of conditions is itself always unconditioned; a pure rational conception in general can be defined and explained by means of the conception of the unconditioned, in so far as it contains a basis for the synthesis of the conditioned.", "To the number of modes of relation which the understanding cogitates by means of the categories, the number of pure rational conceptions will correspond.", "We must therefore seek for, first, an unconditioned of the categorical synthesis in a subject; secondly, of the hypothetical synthesis of the members of a series; thirdly, of the disjunctive synthesis of parts in a system.", "There are exactly the same number of modes of syllogisms, each of which proceeds through prosyllogisms to the unconditionedâ€one to the subject which cannot be employed as predicate, another to the presupposition which supposes nothing higher than itself, and the third to an aggregate of the members of the complete division of a conception.", "Hence the pure rational conceptions of totality in the synthesis of conditions have a necessary foundation in the nature of human reasonâ€at least as modes of elevating the unity of the understanding to the unconditioned.", "They may have no valid application, corresponding to their transcendental employment, in concreto, and be thus of no greater utility than to direct the understanding how, while extending them as widely as possible, to maintain its exercise and application in perfect consistence and harmony.", "But, while speaking here of the totality of conditions and of the unconditioned as the common title of all conceptions of reason, we again light upon an expression which we find it impossible to dispense with, and which nevertheless, owing to the ambiguity attaching to it from long abuse, we cannot employ with safety.", "The word absolute is one of the few words which, in its original signification, was perfectly adequate to the conception it was intended to conveyâ€a conception which no other word in the same language exactly suits, and the lossâ€or, which is the same thing, the incautious and loose employmentâ€of which must be followed by the loss of the conception itself.", "And, as it is a conception which occupies much of the attention of reason, its loss would be greatly to the detriment of all transcendental philosophy.", "The word absolute is at present frequently used to denote that something can be predicated of a thing considered in itself and intrinsically.", "In this sense absolutely possible would signify that which is possible in itself (interne)â€which is, in fact, the least that one can predicate of an object.", "On the other hand, it is sometimes employed to indicate that a thing is valid in all respectsâ€for example, absolute sovereignty.", "Absolutely possible would in this sense signify that which is possible in all relations and in every respect; and this is the most that can be predicated of the possibility of a thing.", "Now these significations do in truth frequently coincide.", "Thus, for example, that which is intrinsically impossible, is also impossible in all relations, that is, absolutely impossible.", "But in most cases they differ from each other toto caelo, and I can by no means conclude that, because a thing is in itself possible, it is also possible in all relations, and therefore absolutely.", "Nay, more, I shall in the sequel show that absolute necessity does not by any means depend on internal necessity, and that, therefore, it must not be considered as synonymous with it.", "Of an opposite which is intrinsically impossible, we may affirm that it is in all respects impossible, and that, consequently, the thing itself, of which this is the opposite, is absolutely necessary; but I cannot reason conversely and say, the opposite of that which is absolutely necessary is intrinsically impossible, that is, that the absolute necessity of things is an internal necessity.", "For this internal necessity is in certain cases a mere empty word with which the least conception cannot be connected, while the conception of the necessity of a thing in all relations possesses very peculiar determinations.", "Now as the loss of a conception of great utility in speculative science cannot be a matter of indifference to the philosopher, I trust that the proper determination and careful preservation of the expression on which the conception depends will likewise be not indifferent to him.", "In this enlarged signification, then, shall I employ the word absolute, in opposition to that which is valid only in some particular respect; for the latter is restricted by conditions, the former is valid without any restriction whatever.", "Now the transcendental conception of reason has for its object nothing else than absolute totality in the synthesis of conditions and does not rest satisfied till it has attained to the absolutely, that is, in all respects and relations, unconditioned.", "For pure reason leaves to the understanding everything that immediately relates to the object of intuition or rather to their synthesis in imagination.", "The former restricts itself to the absolute totality in the employment of the conceptions of the understanding and aims at carrying out the synthetical unity which is cogitated in the category, even to the unconditioned.", "This unity may hence be called the rational unity of phenomena, as the other, which the category expresses, may be termed the unity of the understanding.", "Reason, therefore, has an immediate relation to the use of the understanding, not indeed in so far as the latter contains the ground of possible experience (for the conception of the absolute totality of conditions is not a conception that can be employed in experience, because no experience is unconditioned), but solely for the purpose of directing it to a certain unity, of which the understanding has no conception, and the aim of which is to collect into an absolute whole all acts of the understanding.", "Hence the objective employment of the pure conceptions of reason is always transcendent, while that of the pure conceptions of the understanding must, according to their nature, be always immanent, inasmuch as they are limited to possible experience.", "I understand by idea a necessary conception of reason, to which no corresponding object can be discovered in the world of sense.", "Accordingly, the pure conceptions of reason at present under consideration are transcendental ideas.", "They are conceptions of pure reason, for they regard all empirical cognition as determined by means of an absolute totality of conditions.", "They are not mere fictions, but natural and necessary products of reason, and have hence a necessary relation to the whole sphere of the exercise of the understanding.", "And, finally, they are transcendent, and overstep the limits of all experiences, in which, consequently, no object can ever be presented that would be perfectly adequate to a transcendental idea.", "When we use the word idea, we say, as regards its object (an object of the pure understanding), a great deal, but as regards its subject (that is, in respect of its reality under conditions of experience), exceedingly little, because the idea, as the conception of a maximum, can never be completely and adequately presented in concreto.", "Now, as in the merely speculative employment of reason the latter is properly the sole aim, and as in this case the approximation to a conception, which is never attained in practice, is the same thing as if the conception were non existentâ€it is commonly said of the conception of this kind, â€œit is only an idea.â€ So we might very well say, â€œthe absolute totality of all phenomena is only an idea,â€ for, as we never can present an adequate representation of it, it remains for us a problem incapable of solution.", "On the other hand, as in the practical use of the understanding we have only to do with action and practice according to rules, an idea of pure reason can always be given really in concreto, although only partially, nay, it is the indispensable condition of all practical employment of reason.", "The practice or execution of the idea is always limited and defective, but nevertheless within indeterminable boundaries, consequently always under the influence of the conception of an absolute perfection.", "And thus the practical idea is always in the highest degree fruitful, and in relation to real actions indispensably necessary.", "In the idea, pure reason possesses even causality and the power of producing that which its conception contains.", "Hence we cannot say of wisdom, in a disparaging way, â€œit is only an idea.â€ For, for the very reason that it is the idea of the necessary unity of all possible aims, it must be for all practical exertions and endeavours the primitive condition and ruleâ€a rule which, if not constitutive, is at least limitative.", "Now, although we must say of the transcendental conceptions of reason, â€œthey are only ideas,â€ we must not, on this account, look upon them as superfluous and nugatory.", "For, although no object can be determined by them, they can be of great utility, unobserved and at the basis of the edifice of the understanding, as the canon for its extended and self consistent exerciseâ€a canon which, indeed, does not enable it to cognize more in an object than it would cognize by the help of its own conceptions, but which guides it more securely in its cognition.", "Not to mention that they perhaps render possible a transition from our conceptions of nature and the non ego to the practical conceptions, and thus produce for even ethical ideas keeping, so to speak, and connection with the speculative cognitions of reason.", "The explication of all this must be looked for in the sequel.", "But setting aside, in conformity with our original purpose, the consideration of the practical ideas, we proceed to contemplate reason in its speculative use alone, nay, in a still more restricted sphere, to wit, in the transcendental use; and here must strike into the same path which we followed in our deduction of the categories.", "That is to say, we shall consider the logical form of the cognition of reason, that we may see whether reason may not be thereby a source of conceptions which enables us to regard objects in themselves as determined synthetically Ã  priori, in relation to one or other of the functions of reason.", "Reason, considered as the faculty of a certain logical form of cognition, is the faculty of conclusion, that is, of mediate judgementâ€by means of the subsumption of the condition of a possible judgement under the condition of a given judgement.", "The given judgement is the general rule (major).", "The subsumption of the condition of another possible judgement under the condition of the rule is the minor.", "The actual judgement, which enounces the assertion of the rule in the subsumed case, is the conclusion (conclusio).", "The rule predicates something generally under a certain condition.", "The condition of the rule is satisfied in some particular case.", "It follows that what was valid in general under that condition must also be considered as valid in the particular case which satisfies this condition.", "It is very plain that reason attains to a cognition, by means of acts of the understanding which constitute a series of conditions.", "When I arrive at the proposition, â€œAll bodies are changeable,â€ by beginning with the more remote cognition (in which the conception of body does not appear, but which nevertheless contains the condition of that conception), â€œAll compound is changeable,â€ by proceeding from this to a less remote cognition, which stands under the condition of the former, â€œBodies are compound,â€ and hence to a third, which at length connects for me the remote cognition (changeable) with the one before me, â€œConsequently, bodies are changeableâ€â€I have arrived at a cognition (conclusion) through a series of conditions (premisses).", "Now every series, whose exponent (of the categorical or hypothetical judgement) is given, can be continued; consequently the same procedure of reason conducts us to the ratiocinatio polysyllogistica, which is a series of syllogisms, that can be continued either on the side of the conditions (per prosyllogismos) or of the conditioned (per episyllogismos) to an indefinite extent.", "But we very soon perceive that the chain or series of prosyllogisms, that is, of deduced cognitions on the side of the grounds or conditions of a given cognition, in other words, the ascending series of syllogisms must have a very different relation to the faculty of reason from that of the descending series, that is, the progressive procedure of reason on the side of the conditioned by means of episyllogisms.", "For, as in the former case the cognition (conclusio) is given only as conditioned, reason can attain to this cognition only under the presupposition that all the members of the series on the side of the conditions are given (totality in the series of premisses), because only under this supposition is the judgement we may be considering possible Ã  priori; while on the side of the conditioned or the inferences, only an incomplete and becoming, and not a presupposed or given series, consequently only a potential progression, is cogitated.", "Hence, when a cognition is contemplated as conditioned, reason is compelled to consider the series of conditions in an ascending line as completed and given in their totality.", "But if the very same condition is considered at the same time as the condition of other cognitions, which together constitute a series of inferences or consequences in a descending line, reason may preserve a perfect indifference, as to how far this progression may extend _a parte posteriori_, and whether the totality of this series is possible, because it stands in no need of such a series for the purpose of arriving at the conclusion before it, inasmuch as this conclusion is sufficiently guaranteed and determined on grounds a parte priori.", "It may be the case, that upon the side of the conditions the series of premisses has a first or highest condition, or it may not possess this, and so be a parte priori unlimited; but it must, nevertheless, contain totality of conditions, even admitting that we never could succeed in completely apprehending it; and the whole series must be unconditionally true, if the conditioned, which is considered as an inference resulting from it, is to be held as true.", "This is a requirement of reason, which announces its cognition as determined Ã  priori and as necessary, either in itselfâ€and in this case it needs no grounds to rest uponâ€or, if it is deduced, as a member of a series of grounds, which is itself unconditionally true.", "Section III.", "System of Transcendental Ideas  We are not at present engaged with a logical dialectic, which makes complete abstraction of the content of cognition and aims only at unveiling the illusory appearance in the form of syllogisms.", "Our subject is transcendental dialectic, which must contain, completely Ã  priori, the origin of certain cognitions drawn from pure reason, and the origin of certain deduced conceptions, the object of which cannot be given empirically and which therefore lie beyond the sphere of the faculty of understanding.", "We have observed, from the natural relation which the transcendental use of our cognition, in syllogisms as well as in judgements, must have to the logical, that there are three kinds of dialectical arguments, corresponding to the three modes of conclusion, by which reason attains to cognitions on principles; and that in all it is the business of reason to ascend from the conditioned synthesis, beyond which the understanding never proceeds, to the unconditioned which the understanding never can reach.", "Now the most general relations which can exist in our representations are  1st, the relation to the subject; 2nd, the relation to objects, either as phenomena, or as objects of thought in general.", "If we connect this subdivision with the main division, all the relations of our representations, of which we can form either a conception or an idea, are threefold  1.", "The relation to the subject; 2.", "The relation to the manifold of the object as a phenomenon; 3.", "The relation to all things in general.", "Now all pure conceptions have to do in general with the synthetical unity of representations; conceptions of pure reason (transcendental ideas), on the other hand, with the unconditional synthetical unity of all conditions.", "It follows that all transcendental ideas arrange themselves in three classes, the first of which contains the absolute (unconditioned) unity of the thinking subject, the second the absolute unity of the series of the conditions of a phenomenon, the third the absolute unity of the condition of all objects of thought in general.", "The thinking subject is the object matter of Psychology; the sum total of all phenomena (the world) is the object matter of Cosmology; and the thing which contains the highest condition of the possibility of all that is cogitable (the being of all beings) is the object matter of all Theology.", "Thus pure reason presents us with the idea of a transcendental doctrine of the soul (psychologia rationalis), of a transcendental science of the world (cosmologia rationalis), and finally of a transcendental doctrine of God (theologia transcendentalis).", "Understanding cannot originate even the outline of any of these sciences, even when connected with the highest logical use of reason, that is, all cogitable syllogismsâ€for the purpose of proceeding from one object (phenomenon) to all others, even to the utmost limits of the empirical synthesis.", "They are, on the contrary, pure and genuine products, or problems, of pure reason.", "What modi of the pure conceptions of reason these transcendental ideas are will be fully exposed in the following chapter.", "They follow the guiding thread of the categories.", "For pure reason never relates immediately to objects, but to the conceptions of these contained in the understanding.", "In like manner, it will be made manifest in the detailed explanation of these ideasâ€how reason, merely through the synthetical use of the same function which it employs in a categorical syllogism, necessarily attains to the conception of the absolute unity of the thinking subjectâ€how the logical procedure in hypothetical ideas necessarily produces the idea of the absolutely unconditioned in a series of given conditions, and finallyâ€how the mere form of the disjunctive syllogism involves the highest conception of a being of all beings  a thought which at first sight seems in the highest degree paradoxical.", "An objective deduction, such as we were able to present in the case of the categories, is impossible as regards these transcendental ideas.", "For they have, in truth, no relation to any object, in experience, for the very reason that they are only ideas.", "But a subjective deduction of them from the nature of our reason is possible, and has been given in the present chapter.", "It is easy to perceive that the sole aim of pure reason is the absolute totality of the synthesis on the side of the conditions, and that it does not concern itself with the absolute completeness on the Part of the conditioned.", "For of the former alone does she stand in need, in order to preposit the whole series of conditions, and thus present them to the understanding Ã  priori.", "But if we once have a completely (and unconditionally) given condition, there is no further necessity, in proceeding with the series, for a conception of reason; for the understanding takes of itself every step downward, from the condition to the conditioned.", "Thus the transcendental ideas are available only for ascending in the series of conditions, till we reach the unconditioned, that is, principles.", "As regards descending to the conditioned, on the other hand, we find that there is a widely extensive logical use which reason makes of the laws of the understanding, but that a transcendental use thereof is impossible; and that when we form an idea of the absolute totality of such a synthesis, for example, of the whole series of all future changes in the world, this idea is a mere ens rationis, an arbitrary fiction of thought, and not a necessary presupposition of reason.", "For the possibility of the conditioned presupposes the totality of its conditions, but not of its consequences.", "Consequently, this conception is not a transcendental ideaâ€and it is with these alone that we are at present occupied.", "Finally, it is obvious that there exists among the transcendental ideas a certain connection and unity, and that pure reason, by means of them, collects all its cognitions into one system.", "From the cognition of self to the cognition of the world, and through these to the supreme being, the progression is so natural, that it seems to resemble the logical march of reason from the premisses to the conclusion.", "[42] Now whether there lies unobserved at the foundation of these ideas an analogy of the same kind as exists between the logical and transcendental procedure of reason, is another of those questions, the answer to which we must not expect till we arrive at a more advanced stage in our inquiries.", "In this cursory and preliminary view, we have, meanwhile, reached our aim.", "For we have dispelled the ambiguity which attached to the transcendental conceptions of reason, from their being commonly mixed up with other conceptions in the systems of philosophers, and not properly distinguished from the conceptions of the understanding; we have exposed their origin and, thereby, at the same time their determinate number, and presented them in a systematic connection, and have thus marked out and enclosed a definite sphere for pure reason.", "[42] The science of Metaphysics has for the proper object of its  inquiries only three grand ideas  GOD, FREEDOM, and IMMORTALITY, and  it aims at showing, that the second conception, conjoined with the  first, must lead to the third, as a necessary conclusion.", "All the  other subjects with which it occupies itself, are merely means for the  attainment and realization of these ideas.", "It does not require these  ideas for the construction of a science of nature, but, on the  contrary, for the purpose of passing beyond the sphere of nature.", "A  complete insight into and comprehension of them would render Theology,  Ethics, and, through the conjunction of both, Religion, solely  dependent on the speculative faculty of reason.", "In a systematic  representation of these ideas the above mentioned arrangementâ€the  synthetical oneâ€would be the most suitable; but in the investigation  which must necessarily precede it, the analytical, which reverses this  arrangement, would be better adapted to our purpose, as in it we  should proceed from that which experience immediately presents to  usâ€psychology, to cosmology, and thence to theology.", "TRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTICâ€BOOK IIâ€OF THE DIALECTICAL PROCEDURE OF PURE REASON  It may be said that the object of a merely transcendental idea is something of which we have no conception, although the idea may be a necessary product of reason according to its original laws.", "For, in fact, a conception of an object that is adequate to the idea given by reason, is impossible.", "For such an object must be capable of being presented and intuited in a Possible experience.", "But we should express our meaning better, and with less risk of being misunderstood, if we said that we can have no knowledge of an object, which perfectly corresponds to an idea, although we may possess a problematical conception thereof.", "Now the transcendental (subjective) reality at least of the pure conceptions of reason rests upon the fact that we are led to such ideas by a necessary procedure of reason.", "There must therefore be syllogisms which contain no empirical premisses, and by means of which we conclude from something that we do know, to something of which we do not even possess a conception, to which we, nevertheless, by an unavoidable illusion, ascribe objective reality.", "Such arguments are, as regards their result, rather to be termed sophisms than syllogisms, although indeed, as regards their origin, they are very well entitled to the latter name, inasmuch as they are not fictions or accidental products of reason, but are necessitated by its very nature.", "They are sophisms, not of men, but of pure reason herself, from which the Wisest cannot free himself.", "After long labour he may be able to guard against the error, but he can never be thoroughly rid of the illusion which continually mocks and misleads him.", "Of these dialectical arguments there are three kinds, corresponding to the number of the ideas which their conclusions present.", "In the argument or syllogism of the first class, I conclude, from the transcendental conception of the subject contains no manifold, the absolute unity of the subject itself, of which I cannot in this manner attain to a conception.", "This dialectical argument I shall call the transcendental paralogism.", "The second class of sophistical arguments is occupied with the transcendental conception of the absolute totality of the series of conditions for a given phenomenon, and I conclude, from the fact that I have always a self contradictory conception of the unconditioned synthetical unity of the series upon one side, the truth of the opposite unity, of which I have nevertheless no conception.", "The condition of reason in these dialectical arguments, I shall term the antinomy of pure reason.", "Finally, according to the third kind of sophistical argument, I conclude, from the totality of the conditions of thinking objects in general, in so far as they can be given, the absolute synthetical unity of all conditions of the possibility of things in general; that is, from things which I do not know in their mere transcendental conception, I conclude a being of all beings which I know still less by means of a transcendental conception, and of whose unconditioned necessity I can form no conception whatever.", "This dialectical argument I shall call the ideal of pure reason.", "Chapter I. Of the Paralogisms of Pure Reason  The logical paralogism consists in the falsity of an argument in respect of its form, be the content what it may.", "But a transcendental paralogism has a transcendental foundation, and concludes falsely, while the form is correct and unexceptionable.", "In this manner the paralogism has its foundation in the nature of human reason, and is the parent of an unavoidable, though not insoluble, mental illusion.", "We now come to a conception which was not inserted in the general list of transcendental conceptions, and yet must be reckoned with them, but at the same time without in the least altering, or indicating a deficiency in that table.", "This is the conception, or, if the term is preferred, the judgement, â€œI think.â€ But it is readily perceived that this thought is as it were the vehicle of all conceptions in general, and consequently of transcendental conceptions also, and that it is therefore regarded as a transcendental conception, although it can have no peculiar claim to be so ranked, inasmuch as its only use is to indicate that all thought is accompanied by consciousness.", "At the same time, pure as this conception is from empirical content (impressions of the senses), it enables us to distinguish two different kinds of objects.", "â€œI,â€ as thinking, am an object of the internal sense, and am called soul.", "That which is an object of the external senses is called body.", "Thus the expression, â€œI,â€ as a thinking being, designates the object matter of psychology, which may be called â€œthe rational doctrine of the soul,â€ inasmuch as in this science I desire to know nothing of the soul but what, independently of all experience (which determines me in concreto), may be concluded from this conception â€œI,â€ in so far as it appears in all thought.", "Now, the rational doctrine of the soul is really an undertaking of this kind.", "For if the smallest empirical element of thought, if any particular perception of my internal state, were to be introduced among the grounds of cognition of this science, it would not be a rational, but an empirical doctrine of the soul.", "We have thus before us a pretended science, raised upon the single proposition, â€œI think,â€ whose foundation or want of foundation we may very properly, and agreeably with the nature of a transcendental philosophy, here examine.", "It ought not to be objected that in this proposition, which expresses the perception of oneâ€™s self, an internal experience is asserted, and that consequently the rational doctrine of the soul which is founded upon it, is not pure, but partly founded upon an empirical principle.", "For this internal perception is nothing more than the mere apperception, â€œI think,â€ which in fact renders all transcendental conceptions possible, in which we say, â€œI think substance, cause, etc.â€ For internal experience in general and its possibility, or perception in general, and its relation to other perceptions, unless some particular distinction or determination thereof is empirically given, cannot be regarded as empirical cognition, but as cognition of the empirical, and belongs to the investigation of the possibility of every experience, which is certainly transcendental.", "The smallest object of experience (for example, only pleasure or pain), that should be included in the general representation of self consciousness, would immediately change the rational into an empirical psychology.", "â€œI thinkâ€ is therefore the only text of rational psychology, from which it must develop its whole system.", "It is manifest that this thought, when applied to an object (myself), can contain nothing but transcendental predicates thereof; because the least empirical predicate would destroy the purity of the science and its independence of all experience.", "But we shall have to follow here the guidance of the categoriesâ€only, as in the present case a thing, â€œI,â€ as thinking being, is at first given, we shallâ€not indeed change the order of the categories as it stands in the tableâ€but begin at the category of substance, by which at the a thing in itself is represented and proceeds backwards through the series.", "The topic of the rational doctrine of the soul, from which everything else it may contain must be deduced, is accordingly as follows               1                          2   The Soul is SUBSTANCE       As regards its quality                                 it is SIMPLE                        3           As regards the different           times in which it exists,           it is numerically identical,           that is UNITY, not Plurality.", "4   It is in relation to possible objects in space[43]   [43] The reader, who may not so easily perceive the psychological  sense of these expressions, taken here in their transcendental  abstraction, and cannot guess why the latter attribute of the soul  belongs to the category of existence, will find the expressions  sufficiently explained and justified in the sequel.", "I have, moreover,  to apologize for the Latin terms which have been employed, instead of  their German synonyms, contrary to the rules of correct writing.", "But I  judged it better to sacrifice elegance to perspicuity.", "From these elements originate all the conceptions of pure psychology, by combination alone, without the aid of any other principle.", "This substance, merely as an object of the internal sense, gives the conception of Immateriality; as simple substance, that of Incorruptibility; its identity, as intellectual substance, gives the conception of Personality; all these three together, Spirituality.", "Its relation to objects in space gives us the conception of connection (commercium) with bodies.", "Thus it represents thinking substance as the principle of life in matter, that is, as a soul (anima), and as the ground of Animality; and this, limited and determined by the conception of spirituality, gives us that of Immortality.", "Now to these conceptions relate four paralogisms of a transcendental psychology, which is falsely held to be a science of pure reason, touching the nature of our thinking being.", "We can, however, lay at the foundation of this science nothing but the simple and in itself perfectly contentless representation â€œiâ€ which cannot even be called a conception, but merely a consciousness which accompanies all conceptions.", "By this â€œI,â€ or â€œHe,â€ or â€œIt,â€ who or which thinks, nothing more is represented than a transcendental subject of thought = x, which is cognized only by means of the thoughts that are its predicates, and of which, apart from these, we cannot form the least conception.", "Hence in a perpetual circle, inasmuch as we must always employ it, in order to frame any judgement respecting it.", "And this inconvenience we find it impossible to rid ourselves of, because consciousness in itself is not so much a representation distinguishing a particular object, as a form of representation in general, in so far as it may be termed cognition; for in and by cognition alone do I think anything.", "It must, however, appear extraordinary at first sight that the condition under which I think, and which is consequently a property of my subject, should be held to be likewise valid for every existence which thinks, and that we can presume to base upon a seemingly empirical proposition a judgement which is apodeictic and universal, to wit, that everything which thinks is constituted as the voice of my consciousness declares it to be, that is, as a self conscious being.", "The cause of this belief is to be found in the fact that we necessarily attribute to things Ã  priori all the properties which constitute conditions under which alone we can cogitate them.", "Now I cannot obtain the least representation of a thinking being by means of external experience, but solely through self consciousness.", "Such objects are consequently nothing more than the transference of this consciousness of mine to other things which can only thus be represented as thinking beings.", "The proposition, â€œI think,â€ is, in the present case, understood in a problematical sense, not in so far as it contains a perception of an existence (like the Cartesian â€œCogito, ergo sumâ€), but in regard to its mere possibilityâ€for the purpose of discovering what properties may be inferred from so simple a proposition and predicated of the subject of it.", "If at the foundation of our pure rational cognition of thinking beings there lay more than the mere Cogitoâ€if we could likewise call in aid observations on the play of our thoughts, and the thence derived natural laws of the thinking self, there would arise an empirical psychology which would be a kind of physiology of the internal sense and might possibly be capable of explaining the phenomena of that sense.", "But it could never be available for discovering those properties which do not belong to possible experience (such as the quality of simplicity), nor could it make any apodeictic enunciation on the nature of thinking beings  it would therefore not be a rational psychology.", "Now, as the proposition â€œI thinkâ€ (in the problematical sense) contains the form of every judgement in general and is the constant accompaniment of all the categories, it is manifest that conclusions are drawn from it only by a transcendental employment of the understanding.", "This use of the understanding excludes all empirical elements;

and the  principles of our analytic have clearly proved that no other than an  empirical use of the categoriesâ€that of substance, for exampleâ€is  possible.", "But if the rationalist is bold enough to construct, on the  mere authority of the faculty of thoughtâ€without any intuition,  whereby an object is givenâ€a self subsistent being, merely because the  unity of apperception in thought cannot allow him to believe it a  composite being, instead of declaring, as he ought to do, that he is  unable to explain the possibility of a thinking nature;

but it  precedes experience, whose province it is to determine an object of  perception by means of the categories in relation to time; and  existence in this proposition is not a category, as it does not apply  to an undetermined given object, but only to one of which we have a  conception, and about which we wish to know whether it does or does  not exist, out of, and apart from this conception.", "An undetermined  perception signifies here merely something real that has been given,  only, however, to thought in generalâ€but not as a phenomenon, nor as a  thing in itself (noumenon), but only as something that really exists,  and is designated as such in the proposition, â€œI think.â€ For it must  be remarked that, when I call the proposition, â€œI think,â€ an empirical  proposition, I do not thereby mean that the Ego in the proposition is  an empirical representation; on the contrary, it is purely  intellectual, because it belongs to thought in general.", "But without  some empirical representation, which presents to the mind material for  thought, the mental act, â€œI think,â€ would not take place; and the  empirical is only the condition of the application or employment of  the pure intellectual faculty.", "Thus, then, appears the vanity of the hope of establishing a cognition which is to extend its rule beyond the limits of experienceâ€a cognition which is one of the highest interests of humanity; and thus is proved the futility of the attempt of speculative philosophy in this region of thought.", "But, in this interest of thought, the severity of criticism has rendered to reason a not unimportant service, by the demonstration of the impossibility of making any dogmatical affirmation concerning an object of experience beyond the boundaries of experience.", "She has thus fortified reason against all affirmations of the contrary.", "Now, this can be accomplished in only two ways.", "Either our proposition must be proved apodeictically; or, if this is unsuccessful, the sources of this inability must be sought for, and, if these are discovered to exist in the natural and necessary limitation of our reason, our opponents must submit to the same law of renunciation and refrain from advancing claims to dogmatic assertion.", "But the right, say rather the necessity to admit a future life, upon principles of the practical conjoined with the speculative use of reason, has lost nothing by this renunciation; for the merely speculative proof has never had any influence upon the common reason of men.", "It stands upon the point of a hair, so that even the schools have been able to preserve it from falling only by incessantly discussing it and spinning it like a top; and even in their eyes it has never been able to present any safe foundation for the erection of a theory.", "The proofs which have been current among men, preserve their value undiminished; nay, rather gain in clearness and unsophisticated power, by the rejection of the dogmatical assumptions of speculative reason.", "For reason is thus confined within her own peculiar provinceâ€the arrangement of ends or aims, which is at the same time the arrangement of nature; and, as a practical faculty, without limiting itself to the latter, it is justified in extending the former, and with it our own existence, beyond the boundaries of experience and life.", "If we turn our attention to the analogy of the nature of living beings in this world, in the consideration of which reason is obliged to accept as a principle that no organ, no faculty, no appetite is useless, and that nothing is superfluous, nothing disproportionate to its use, nothing unsuited to its end; but that, on the contrary, everything is perfectly conformed to its destination in lifeâ€we shall find that man, who alone is the final end and aim of this order, is still the only animal that seems to be excepted from it.", "For his natural giftsâ€not merely as regards the talents and motives that may incite him to employ them, but especially the moral law in himâ€stretch so far beyond all mere earthly utility and advantage, that he feels himself bound to prize the mere consciousness of probity, apart from all advantageous consequencesâ€even the shadowy gift of posthumous fameâ€above everything; and he is conscious of an inward call to constitute himself, by his conduct in this worldâ€without regard to mere sublunary interestsâ€the citizen of a better.", "This mighty, irresistible proofâ€accompanied by an ever increasing knowledge of the conformability to a purpose in everything we see around us, by the conviction of the boundless immensity of creation, by the consciousness of a certain illimitableness in the possible extension of our knowledge, and by a desire commensurate therewithâ€remains to humanity, even after the theoretical cognition of ourselves has failed to establish the necessity of an existence after death.", "Conclusion of the Solution of the Psychological Paralogism.", "The dialectical illusion in rational psychology arises from our confounding an idea of reason (of a pure intelligence) with the conceptionâ€in every respect undeterminedâ€of a thinking being in general.", "I cogitate myself in behalf of a possible experience, at the same time making abstraction of all actual experience; and infer therefrom that I can be conscious of myself apart from experience and its empirical conditions.", "I consequently confound the possible abstraction of my empirically determined existence with the supposed consciousness of a possible separate existence of my thinking self; and I believe that I cognize what is substantial in myself as a transcendental subject, when I have nothing more in thought than the unity of consciousness, which lies at the basis of all determination of cognition.", "The task of explaining the community of the soul with the body does not properly belong to the psychology of which we are here speaking; because it proposes to prove the personality of the soul apart from this communion (after death), and is therefore transcendent in the proper sense of the word, although occupying itself with an object of experienceâ€only in so far, however, as it ceases to be an object of experience.", "But a sufficient answer may be found to the question in our system.", "The difficulty which lies in the execution of this task consists, as is well known, in the presupposed heterogeneity of the object of the internal sense (the soul) and the objects of the external senses; inasmuch as the formal condition of the intuition of the one is time, and of that of the other space also.", "But if we consider that both kinds of objects do not differ internally, but only in so far as the one appears externally to the otherâ€consequently, that what lies at the basis of phenomena, as a thing in itself, may not be heterogeneous; this difficulty disappears.", "There then remains no other difficulty than is to be found in the questionâ€how a community of substances is possible; a question which lies out of the region of psychology, and which the reader, after what in our analytic has been said of primitive forces and faculties, will easily judge to be also beyond the region of human cognition.", "GENERAL REMARK  On the Transition from Rational Psychology to Cosmology.", "The proposition, â€œI think,â€ or, â€œI exist thinking,â€ is an empirical proposition.", "But such a proposition must be based on empirical intuition, and the object cogitated as a phenomenon; and thus our theory appears to maintain that the soul, even in thought, is merely a phenomenon; and in this way our consciousness itself, in fact, abuts upon nothing.", "Thought, per se, is merely the purely spontaneous logical function which operates to connect the manifold of a possible intuition; and it does not represent the subject of consciousness as a phenomenonâ€for this reason alone, that it pays no attention to the question whether the mode of intuiting it is sensuous or intellectual.", "I therefore do not represent myself in thought either as I am, or as I appear to myself; I merely cogitate myself as an object in general, of the mode of intuiting which I make abstraction.", "When I represent myself as the subject of thought, or as the ground of thought, these modes of representation are not related to the categories of substance or of cause; for these are functions of thought applicable only to our sensuous intuition.", "The application of these categories to the Ego would, however, be necessary, if I wished to make myself an object of knowledge.", "But I wish to be conscious of myself only as thinking; in what mode my Self is given in intuition, I do not consider, and it may be that I, who think, am a phenomenonâ€although not in so far as I am a thinking being; but in the consciousness of myself in mere thought I am a being, though this consciousness does not present to me any property of this being as material for thought.", "But the proposition, â€œI think,â€ in so far as it declares, â€œI exist thinking,â€ is not the mere representation of a logical function.", "It determines the subject (which is in this case an object also) in relation to existence; and it cannot be given without the aid of the internal sense, whose intuition presents to us an object, not as a thing in itself, but always as a phenomenon.", "In this proposition there is therefore something more to be found than the mere spontaneity of thought; there is also the receptivity of intuition, that is, my thought of myself applied to the empirical intuition of myself.", "Now, in this intuition the thinking self must seek the conditions of the employment of its logical functions as categories of substance, cause, and so forth; not merely for the purpose of distinguishing itself as an object in itself by means of the representation â€œI,â€ but also for the purpose of determining the mode of its existence, that is, of cognizing itself as noumenon.", "But this is impossible, for the internal empirical intuition is sensuous, and presents us with nothing but phenomenal data, which do not assist the object of pure consciousness in its attempt to cognize itself as a separate existence, but are useful only as contributions to experience.", "But, let it be granted that we could discover, not in experience, but in certain firmly established Ã  priori laws of the use of pure reasonâ€laws relating to our existence, authority to consider ourselves as legislating Ã  priori in relation to our own existence and as determining this existence; we should, on this supposition, find ourselves possessed of a spontaneity, by which our actual existence would be determinable, without the aid of the conditions of empirical intuition.", "We should also become aware that in the consciousness of our existence there was an Ã  priori content, which would serve to determine our own existenceâ€an existence only sensuously determinableâ€relatively, however, to a certain internal faculty in relation to an intelligible world.", "But this would not give the least help to the attempts of rational psychology.", "For this wonderful faculty, which the consciousness of the moral law in me reveals, would present me with a principle of the determination of my own existence which is purely intellectualâ€but by what predicates?", "By none other than those which are given in sensuous intuition.", "Thus I should find myself in the same position in rational psychology which I formerly occupied, that is to say, I should find myself still in need of sensuous intuitions, in order to give significance to my conceptions of substance and cause, by means of which alone I can possess a knowledge of myself  but these intuitions can never raise me above the sphere of experience.", "I should be justified, however, in applying these conceptions, in regard to their practical use, which is always directed to objects of experienceâ€in conformity with their analogical significance when employed theoreticallyâ€to freedom and its subject.", "At the same time, I should understand by them merely the logical functions of subject and predicate, of principle and consequence, in conformity with which all actions are so determined, that they are capable of being explained along with the laws of nature, conformably to the categories of substance and cause, although they originate from a very different principle.", "We have made these observations for the purpose of guarding against misunderstanding, to which the doctrine of our intuition of self as a phenomenon is exposed.", "We shall have occasion to perceive their utility in the sequel.", "Chapter II.", "The Antinomy of Pure Reason  We showed in the introduction to this part of our work, that all transcendental illusion of pure reason arose from dialectical arguments, the schema of which logic gives us in its three formal species of syllogismsâ€just as the categories find their logical schema in the four functions of all judgements.", "The first kind of these sophistical arguments related to the unconditioned unity of the subjective conditions of all representations in general (of the subject or soul), in correspondence with the categorical syllogisms, the major of which, as the principle, enounces the relation of a predicate to a subject.", "The second kind of dialectical argument will therefore be concerned, following the analogy with hypothetical syllogisms, with the unconditioned unity of the objective conditions in the phenomenon; and, in this way, the theme of the third kind to be treated of in the following chapter will be the unconditioned unity of the objective conditions of the possibility of objects in general.", "But it is worthy of remark that the transcendental paralogism produced in the mind only a one third illusion, in regard to the idea of the subject of our thought; and the conceptions of reason gave no ground to maintain the contrary proposition.", "The advantage is completely on the side of Pneumatism; although this theory itself passes into naught, in the crucible of pure reason.", "Very different is the case when we apply reason to the objective synthesis of phenomena.", "Here, certainly, reason establishes, with much plausibility, its principle of unconditioned unity; but it very soon falls into such contradictions that it is compelled, in relation to cosmology, to renounce its pretensions.", "For here a new phenomenon of human reason meets usâ€a perfectly natural antithetic, which does not require to be sought for by subtle sophistry, but into which reason of itself unavoidably falls.", "It is thereby preserved, to be sure, from the slumber of a fancied convictionâ€which a merely one sided illusion produces; but it is at the same time compelled, either, on the one hand, to abandon itself to a despairing scepticism, or, on the other, to assume a dogmatical confidence and obstinate persistence in certain assertions, without granting a fair hearing to the other side of the question.", "Either is the death of a sound philosophy, although the former might perhaps deserve the title of the euthanasia of pure reason.", "Before entering this region of discord and confusion, which the conflict of the laws of pure reason (antinomy) produces, we shall present the reader with some considerations, in explanation and justification of the method we intend to follow in our treatment of this subject.", "I term all transcendental ideas, in so far as they relate to the absolute totality in the synthesis of phenomena, cosmical conceptions; partly on account of this unconditioned totality, on which the conception of the world whole is basedâ€a conception, which is itself an ideaâ€partly because they relate solely to the synthesis of phenomenaâ€the empirical synthesis; while, on the other hand, the absolute totality in the synthesis of the conditions of all possible things gives rise to an ideal of pure reason, which is quite distinct from the cosmical conception, although it stands in relation with it.", "Hence, as the paralogisms of pure reason laid the foundation for a dialectical psychology, the antinomy of pure reason will present us with the transcendental principles of a pretended pure (rational) cosmologyâ€not, however, to declare it valid and to appropriate it, butâ€as the very term of a conflict of reason sufficiently indicates, to present it as an idea which cannot be reconciled with phenomena and experience.", "Section I. System of Cosmological Ideas  That We may be able to enumerate with systematic precision these ideas according to a principle, we must remark, in the first place, that it is from the understanding alone that pure and transcendental conceptions take their origin; that the reason does not properly give birth to any conception, but only frees the conception of the understanding from the unavoidable limitation of a possible experience, and thus endeavours to raise it above the empirical, though it must still be in connection with it.", "This happens from the fact that, for a given conditioned, reason demands absolute totality on the side of the conditions (to which the understanding submits all phenomena), and thus makes of the category a transcendental idea.", "This it does that it may be able to give absolute completeness to the empirical synthesis, by continuing it to the unconditioned (which is not to be found in experience, but only in the idea).", "Reason requires this according to the principle  If the conditioned is given the whole of the conditions, and consequently the absolutely unconditioned, is also given, whereby alone the former was possible.", "First, then, the transcendental ideas are properly nothing but categories elevated to the unconditioned; and they may be arranged in a table according to the titles of the latter.", "But, secondly, all the categories are not available for this purpose, but only those in which the synthesis constitutes a seriesâ€of conditions subordinated to, not co ordinated with, each other.", "Absolute totality is required of reason only in so far as concerns the ascending series of the conditions of a conditioned; not, consequently, when the question relates to the descending series of consequences, or to the aggregate of the co ordinated conditions of these consequences.", "For, in relation to a given conditioned, conditions are presupposed and considered to be given along with it.", "On the other hand, as the consequences do not render possible their conditions, but rather presuppose themâ€in the consideration of the procession of consequences (or in the descent from the given condition to the conditioned), we may be quite unconcerned whether the series ceases or not; and their totality is not a necessary demand of reason.", "Thus we cogitateâ€and necessarilyâ€a given time completely elapsed up to a given moment, although that time is not determinable by us.", "But as regards time future, which is not the condition of arriving at the present, in order to conceive it; it is quite indifferent whether we consider future time as ceasing at some point, or as prolonging itself to infinity.", "Take, for example, the series m, n, o, in which n is given as conditioned in relation to m, but at the same time as the condition of o, and let the series proceed upwards from the conditioned n to m (l, k, i, etc.", "), and also downwards from the condition n to the conditioned o (p, q, r, etc.", ")â€I must presuppose the former series, to be able to consider n as given, and n is according to reason (the totality of conditions) possible only by means of that series.", "But its possibility does not rest on the following series o, p, q, r, which for this reason cannot be regarded as given, but only as capable of being given (dabilis).", "I shall term the synthesis of the series on the side of the conditionsâ€from that nearest to the given phenomenon up to the more remoteâ€regressive; that which proceeds on the side of the conditioned, from the immediate consequence to the more remote, I shall call the progressive synthesis.", "The former proceeds in antecedentia, the latter in consequentia.", "The cosmological ideas are therefore occupied with the totality of the regressive synthesis, and proceed in antecedentia, not in consequentia.", "When the latter takes place, it is an arbitrary and not a necessary problem of pure reason; for we require, for the complete understanding of what is given in a phenomenon, not the consequences which succeed, but the grounds or principles which precede.", "In order to construct the table of ideas in correspondence with the table of categories, we take first the two primitive quanta of all our intuitions, time and space.", "Time is in itself a series (and the formal condition of all series), and hence, in relation to a given present, we must distinguish Ã  priori in it the antecedentia as conditions (time past) from the consequentia (time future).", "Consequently, the transcendental idea of the absolute totality of the series of the conditions of a given conditioned, relates merely to all past time.", "According to the idea of reason, the whole past time, as the condition of the given moment, is necessarily cogitated as given.", "But, as regards space, there exists in it no distinction between progressus and regressus; for it is an aggregate and not a seriesâ€its parts existing together at the same time.", "I can consider a given point of time in relation to past time only as conditioned, because this given moment comes into existence only through the past time rather through the passing of the preceding time.", "But as the parts of space are not subordinated, but co ordinated to each other, one part cannot be the condition of the possibility of the other; and space is not in itself, like time, a series.", "But the synthesis of the manifold parts of spaceâ€(the syntheses whereby we apprehend space)â€is nevertheless successive; it takes place, therefore, in time, and contains a series.", "And as in this series of aggregated spaces (for example, the feet in a rood), beginning with a given portion of space, those which continue to be annexed form the condition of the limits of the formerâ€the measurement of a space must also be regarded as a synthesis of the series of the conditions of a given conditioned.", "It differs, however, in this respect from that of time, that the side of the conditioned is not in itself distinguishable from the side of the condition; and, consequently, regressus and progressus in space seem to be identical.", "But, inasmuch as one part of space is not given, but only limited, by and through another, we must also consider every limited space as conditioned, in so far as it presupposes some other space as the condition of its limitation, and so on.", "As regards limitation, therefore, our procedure in space is also a regressus, and the transcendental idea of the absolute totality of the synthesis in a series of conditions applies to space also; and I am entitled to demand the absolute totality of the phenomenal synthesis in space as well as in time.", "Whether my demand can be satisfied is a question to be answered in the sequel.", "Secondly, the real in spaceâ€that is, matterâ€is conditioned.", "Its internal conditions are its parts, and the parts of parts its remote conditions; so that in this case we find a regressive synthesis, the absolute totality of which is a demand of reason.", "But this cannot be obtained otherwise than by a complete division of parts, whereby the real in matter becomes either nothing or that which is not matter, that is to say, the simple.", "Consequently we find here also a series of conditions and a progress to the unconditioned.", "Thirdly, as regards the categories of a real relation between phenomena, the category of substance and its accidents is not suitable for the formation of a transcendental idea; that is to say, reason has no ground, in regard to it, to proceed regressively with conditions.", "For accidents (in so far as they inhere in a substance) are co ordinated with each other, and do not constitute a series.", "And, in relation to substance, they are not properly subordinated to it, but are the mode of existence of the substance itself.", "The conception of the substantial might nevertheless seem to be an idea of the transcendental reason.", "But, as this signifies nothing more than the conception of an object in general, which subsists in so far as we cogitate in it merely a transcendental subject without any predicates; and as the question here is of an unconditioned in the series of phenomenaâ€it is clear that the substantial can form no member thereof.", "The same holds good of substances in community, which are mere aggregates and do not form a series.", "For they are not subordinated to each other as conditions of the possibility of each other; which, however, may be affirmed of spaces, the limits of which are never determined in themselves, but always by some other space.", "It is, therefore, only in the category of causality that we can find a series of causes to a given effect, and in which we ascend from the latter, as the conditioned, to the former as the conditions, and thus answer the question of reason.", "Fourthly, the conceptions of the possible, the actual, and the necessary do not conduct us to any seriesâ€excepting only in so far as the contingent in existence must always be regarded as conditioned, and as indicating, according to a law of the understanding, a condition, under which it is necessary to rise to a higher, till in the totality of the series, reason arrives at unconditioned necessity.", "There are, accordingly, only four cosmological ideas, corresponding with the four titles of the categories.", "For we can select only such as necessarily furnish us with a series in the synthesis of the manifold.", "1             The absolute Completeness                     of the                  COMPOSITION      of the given totality of all phenomena.", "2             The absolute Completeness                     of the                    DIVISION      of given totality in a phenomenon.", "3             The absolute Completeness                      of the                    ORIGINATION                   of a phenomenon.", "4             The absolute Completeness          of the DEPENDENCE of the EXISTENCE         of what is changeable in a phenomenon.", "We must here remark, in the first place, that the idea of absolute totality relates to nothing but the exposition of phenomena, and therefore not to the pure conception of a totality of things.", "Phenomena are here, therefore, regarded as given, and reason requires the absolute completeness of the conditions of their possibility, in so far as these conditions constitute a seriesâ€consequently an absolutely (that is, in every respect) complete synthesis, whereby a phenomenon can be explained according to the laws of the understanding.", "Secondly, it is properly the unconditioned alone that reason seeks in this serially and regressively conducted synthesis of conditions.", "It wishes, to speak in another way, to attain to completeness in the series of premisses, so as to render it unnecessary to presuppose others.", "This unconditioned is always contained in the absolute totality of the series, when we endeavour to form a representation of it in thought.", "But this absolutely complete synthesis is itself but an idea; for it is impossible, at least before hand, to know whether any such synthesis is possible in the case of phenomena.", "When we represent all existence in thought by means of pure conceptions of the understanding, without any conditions of sensuous intuition, we may say with justice that for a given conditioned the whole series of conditions subordinated to each other is also given; for the former is only given through the latter.", "But we find in the case of phenomena a particular limitation of the mode in which conditions are given, that is, through the successive synthesis of the manifold of intuition, which must be complete in the regress.", "Now whether this completeness is sensuously possible, is a problem.", "But the idea of it lies in the reasonâ€be it possible or impossible to connect with the idea adequate empirical conceptions.", "Therefore, as in the absolute totality of the regressive synthesis of the manifold in a phenomenon (following the guidance of the categories, which represent it as a series of conditions to a given conditioned) the unconditioned is necessarily containedâ€it being still left unascertained whether and how this totality exists;

or the absolutely unconditioned is only a part of the series, to which the other members are subordinated, but which Is not itself submitted to any other condition.", "[48] In the former case the series is a parte priori unlimited (without beginning), that is, infinite, and nevertheless completely given.", "But the regress in it is never completed, and can only be called potentially infinite.", "In the second case there exists a first in the series.", "This first is called, in relation to past time, the beginning of the world;

because beyond it there exist no  other conditions, on which it might depend.", "But the absolute totality  of such a series is only an idea, or rather a problematical  conception, the possibility of which must be investigatedâ€particularly  in relation to the mode in which the unconditioned, as the  transcendental idea which is the real subject of inquiry, may be  contained therein.", "We possess two expressions, world and nature, which are generally interchanged.", "The first denotes the mathematical total of all phenomena and the totality of their synthesisâ€in its progress by means of composition, as well as by division.", "And the world is termed nature,[49] when it is regarded as a dynamical wholeâ€when our attention is not directed to the aggregation in space and time, for the purpose of cogitating it as a quantity, but to the unity in the existence of phenomena.", "In this case the condition of that which happens is called a cause; the unconditioned causality of the cause in a phenomenon is termed liberty; the conditioned cause is called in a more limited sense a natural cause.", "The conditioned in existence is termed contingent, and the unconditioned necessary.", "The unconditioned necessity of phenomena may be called natural necessity.", "[49] Nature, understood adjective (formaliter), signifies the complex  of the determinations of a thing, connected according to an internal  principle of causality.", "On the other hand, we understand by nature,  substantive (materialiter), the sum total of phenomena, in so far as  they, by virtue of an internal principle of causality, are connected  with each other throughout.", "In the former sense we speak of the nature  of liquid matter, of fire, etc., and employ the word only adjective;

on the contrary, the determining causes of nature cease to operate in reference to this event, which certainly succeeds the acts of nature, but does not proceed from them.", "For these reasons, the action of a free agent must be termed, in regard to causality, if not in relation to time, an absolutely primal beginning of a series of phenomena.", "The justification of this need of reason to rest upon a free act as the first beginning of the series of natural causes is evident from the fact, that all philosophers of antiquity (with the exception of the Epicurean school) felt themselves obliged, when constructing a theory of the motions of the universe, to accept a prime mover, that is, a freely acting cause, which spontaneously and prior to all other causes evolved this series of states.", "They always felt the need of going beyond mere nature, for the purpose of making a first beginning comprehensible.", "ON THE ANTITHESIS.", "The assertor of the all sufficiency of nature in regard to causality (transcendental Physiocracy), in opposition to the doctrine of freedom, would defend his view of the question somewhat in the following manner.", "He would say, in answer to the sophistical arguments of the opposite party  If you do not accept a mathematical first, in relation to time, you have no need to seek a dynamical first, in regard to causality.", "Who compelled you to imagine an absolutely primal condition of the world, and therewith an absolute beginning of the gradually progressing successions of phenomenaâ€and, as some foundation for this fancy of yours, to set bounds to unlimited nature?", "Inasmuch as the substances in the world have always existedâ€at least the unity of experience renders such a supposition quite necessaryâ€there is no difficulty in believing also, that the changes in the conditions of these substances have always existed; and, consequently, that a first beginning, mathematical or dynamical, is by no means required.", "The possibility of such an infinite derivation, without any initial member from which all the others result, is certainly quite incomprehensible.", "But, if you are rash enough to deny the enigmatical secrets of nature for this reason, you will find yourselves obliged to deny also the existence of many fundamental properties of natural objects (such as fundamental forces), which you can just as little comprehend; and even the possibility of so simple a conception as that of change must present to you insuperable difficulties.", "For if experience did not teach you that it was real, you never could conceive Ã  priori the possibility of this ceaseless sequence of being and non being.", "But if the existence of a transcendental faculty of freedom is grantedâ€a faculty of originating changes in the worldâ€this faculty must at least exist out of and apart from the world;

while, in the observation and investigation of nature, it would be forced to remain dumb and to confess its utter ignorance.", "Thus indolence and vanity form of themselves strong recommendations of these principles.", "Besides, although it is a hard thing for a philosopher to assume a principle, of which he can give to himself no reasonable account, and still more to employ conceptions, the objective reality of which cannot be established, nothing is more usual with the common understanding.", "It wants something which will allow it to go to work with confidence.", "The difficulty of even comprehending a supposition does not disquiet it, becauseâ€not knowing what comprehending meansâ€it never even thinks of the supposition it may be adopting as a principle;

if the question, for example, is whether the objectâ€the something, the phenomenon of which (internalâ€in ourselves) is thoughtâ€that is to say, the soul, is in itself a simple being; or whether there is a cause of all things, which is absolutely necessaryâ€in such cases we are seeking for our idea an object, of which we may confess that it is unknown to us, though we must not on that account assert that it is impossible.", "[58] The cosmological ideas alone posses the peculiarity that we can presuppose the object of them and the empirical synthesis requisite for the conception of that object to be given; and the question, which arises from these ideas, relates merely to the progress of this synthesis, in so far as it must contain absolute totalityâ€which, however, is not empirical, as it cannot be given in any experience.", "Now, as the question here is solely in regard to a thing as the object of a possible experience and not as a thing in itself, the answer to the transcendental cosmological question need not be sought out of the idea, for the question does not regard an object in itself.", "The question in relation to a possible experience is not, â€œWhat can be given in an experience in concretoâ€ but â€œwhat is contained in the idea, to which the empirical synthesis must approximate.â€ The question must therefore be capable of solution from the idea alone.", "For the idea is a creation of reason itself, which therefore cannot disclaim the obligation to answer or refer us to the unknown object.", "[58] The question, â€œWhat is the constitution of a transcendental  object?â€ is unanswerableâ€we are unable to say what it is; but we can  perceive that the question itself is nothing; because it does not  relate to any object that can be presented to us.", "For this reason, we  must consider all the questions raised in transcendental psychology as  answerable and as really answered;

the one with a speculative, the other with a practical contentâ€pure mathematics and pure ethics.", "Has any one ever heard it alleged that, from our complete and necessary ignorance of the conditions, it is uncertain what exact relation the diameter of a circle bears to the circle in rational or irrational numbers?", "By the former the sum cannot be given exactly, by the latter only approximately;

and we have only to take care that our thoughts are consistent with each other, and to avoid falling into the amphiboly of regarding our idea as a representation of an object empirically given, and therefore to be cognized according to the laws of experience.", "A dogmatical solution is therefore not only unsatisfactory but impossible.", "The critical solution, which may be a perfectly certain one, does not consider the question objectively, but proceeds by inquiring into the basis of the cognition upon which the question rests.", "Section V. Sceptical Exposition of the Cosmological Problems presented in the four Transcendental Ideas  We should be quite willing to desist from the demand of a dogmatical answer to our questions, if we understood beforehand that, be the answer what it may, it would only serve to increase our ignorance, to throw us from one incomprehensibility into another, from one obscurity into another still greater, and perhaps lead us into irreconcilable contradictions.", "If a dogmatical affirmative or negative answer is demanded, is it at all prudent to set aside the probable grounds of a solution which lie before us and to take into consideration what advantage we shall gain, if the answer is to favour the one side or the other?", "If it happens that in both cases the answer is mere nonsense, we have in this an irresistible summons to institute a critical investigation of the question, for the purpose of discovering whether it is based on a groundless presupposition and relates to an idea, the falsity of which would be more easily exposed in its application and consequences than in the mere representation of its content.", "This is the great utility of the sceptical mode of treating the questions addressed by pure reason to itself.", "By this method we easily rid ourselves of the confusions of dogmatism, and establish in its place a temperate criticism, which, as a genuine cathartic, will successfully remove the presumptuous notions of philosophy and their consequenceâ€the vain pretension to universal science.", "If, then, I could understand the nature of a cosmological idea and perceive, before I entered on the discussion of the subject at all, that, whatever side of the question regarding the unconditioned of the regressive synthesis of phenomena it favouredâ€it must either be too great or too small for every conception of the understandingâ€I would be able to comprehend how the idea, which relates to an object of experienceâ€an experience which must be adequate to and in accordance with a possible conception of the understandingâ€must be completely void and without significance, inasmuch as its object is inadequate, consider it as we may.", "And this is actually the case with all cosmological conceptions, which, for the reason above mentioned, involve reason, so long as it remains attached to them, in an unavoidable antinomy.", "For suppose   First, that the world has no beginningâ€in this case it is too large for our conception; for this conception, which consists in a successive regress, cannot overtake the whole eternity that has elapsed.", "Grant that it has a beginning, it is then too small for the conception of the understanding.", "For, as a beginning presupposes a time preceding, it cannot be unconditioned; and the law of the empirical employment of the understanding imposes the necessity of looking for a higher condition of time; and the world is, therefore, evidently too small for this law.", "The same is the case with the double answer to the question regarding the extent, in space, of the world.", "For, if it is infinite and unlimited, it must be too large for every possible empirical conception.", "If it is finite and limited, we have a right to ask  â€œWhat determines these limits?â€ Void space is not a self subsistent correlate of things, and cannot be a final conditionâ€and still less an empirical condition, forming a part of a possible experience.", "For how can we have any experience or perception of an absolute void?", "But the absolute totality of the empirical synthesis requires that the unconditioned be an empirical conception.", "Consequently, a finite world is too small for our conception.", "Secondly, if every phenomenon (matter) in space consists of an infinite number of parts, the regress of the division is always too great for our conception; and if the division of space must cease with some member of the division (the simple), it is too small for the idea of the unconditioned.", "For the member at which we have discontinued our division still admits a regress to many more parts contained in the object.", "Thirdly, suppose that every event in the world happens in accordance with the laws of nature; the causality of a cause must itself be an event and necessitates a regress to a still higher cause, and consequently the unceasing prolongation of the series of conditions a parte priori.", "Operative nature is therefore too large for every conception we can form in the synthesis of cosmical events.", "If we admit the existence of spontaneously produced events, that is, of free agency, we are driven, in our search for sufficient reasons, on an unavoidable law of nature and are compelled to appeal to the empirical law of causality, and we find that any such totality of connection in our synthesis is too small for our necessary empirical conception.", "Fourthly, if we assume the existence of an absolutely necessary beingâ€whether it be the world or something in the world, or the cause of the worldâ€we must place it in a time at an infinite distance from any given moment; for, otherwise, it must be dependent on some other and higher existence.", "Such an existence is, in this case, too large for our empirical conception, and unattainable by the continued regress of any synthesis.", "But if we believe that everything in the worldâ€be it condition or conditionedâ€is contingent; every given existence is too small for our conception.", "For in this case we are compelled to seek for some other existence upon which the former depends.", "We have said that in all these cases the cosmological idea is either too great or too small for the empirical regress in a synthesis, and consequently for every possible conception of the understanding.", "Why did we not express ourselves in a manner exactly the reverse of this and, instead of accusing the cosmological idea of over stepping or of falling short of its true aim, possible experience, say that, in the first case, the empirical conception is always too small for the idea, and in the second too great, and thus attach the blame of these contradictions to the empirical regress?", "The reason is this.", "Possible experience can alone give reality to our conceptions; without it a conception is merely an idea, without truth or relation to an object.", "Hence a possible empirical conception must be the standard by which we are to judge whether an idea is anything more than an idea and fiction of thought, or whether it relates to an object in the world.", "If we say of a thing that in relation to some other thing it is too large or too small, the former is considered as existing for the sake of the latter, and requiring to be adapted to it.", "Among the trivial subjects of discussion in the old schools of dialectics was this question  â€œIf a ball cannot pass through a hole, shall we say that the ball is too large or the hole too small?â€ In this case it is indifferent what expression we employ; for we do not know which exists for the sake of the other.", "On the other hand, we cannot say  â€œThe man is too long for his coatâ€; but  â€œThe coat is too short for the man.â€  We are thus led to the well founded suspicion that the cosmological ideas, and all the conflicting sophistical assertions connected with them, are based upon a false and fictitious conception of the mode in which the object of these ideas is presented to us;

because, as a series of subordinate representations, it subsists only in the dynamical regress and cannot be regarded as existing previously to this regress, or as a self subsistent series of things.", "Thus the antinomy of pure reason in its cosmological ideas disappears.", "For the above demonstration has established the fact that it is merely the product of a dialectical and illusory opposition, which arises from the application of the idea of absolute totalityâ€admissible only as a condition of things in themselvesâ€to phenomena, which exist only in our representations, andâ€when constituting a seriesâ€in a successive regress.", "This antinomy of reason may, however, be really profitable to our speculative interests, not in the way of contributing any dogmatical addition, but as presenting to us another material support in our critical investigations.", "For it furnishes us with an indirect proof of the transcendental ideality of phenomena, if our minds were not completely satisfied with the direct proof set forth in the Trancendental Ã†sthetic.", "The proof would proceed in the following dilemma.", "If the world is a whole existing in itself, it must be either finite or infinite.", "But it is neither finite nor infiniteâ€as has been shown, on the one side, by the thesis, on the other, by the antithesis.", "Therefore the worldâ€the content of all phenomenaâ€is not a whole existing in itself.", "It follows that phenomena are nothing, apart from our representations.", "And this is what we mean by transcendental ideality.", "This remark is of some importance.", "It enables us to see that the proofs of the fourfold antinomy are not mere sophistriesâ€are not fallacious, but grounded on the nature of reason, and validâ€under the supposition that phenomena are things in themselves.", "The opposition of the judgements which follow makes it evident that a fallacy lay in the initial supposition, and thus helps us to discover the true constitution of objects of sense.", "This transcendental dialectic does not favour scepticism, although it presents us with a triumphant demonstration of the advantages of the sceptical method, the great utility of which is apparent in the antinomy, where the arguments of reason were allowed to confront each other in undiminished force.", "And although the result of these conflicts of reason is not what we expectedâ€although we have obtained no positive dogmatical addition to metaphysical scienceâ€we have still reaped a great advantage in the correction of our judgements on these subjects of thought.", "Section VIII.", "Regulative Principle of Pure Reason in relation to the Cosmological Ideas  The cosmological principle of totality could not give us any certain knowledge in regard to the maximum in the series of conditions in the world of sense, considered as a thing in itself.", "The actual regress in the series is the only means of approaching this maximum.", "This principle of pure reason, therefore, may still be considered as validâ€not as an axiom enabling us to cogitate totality in the object as actual, but as a problem for the understanding, which requires it to institute and to continue, in conformity with the idea of totality in the mind, the regress in the series of the conditions of a given conditioned.", "For in the world of sense, that is, in space and time, every condition which we discover in our investigation of phenomena is itself conditioned;

this possible advancement always proceeds to infinity.", "We may proceed from a given pair in the descending line of generation from father to son, and cogitate a never ending line of descendants from it.", "For in such a case reason does not demand absolute totality in the series, because it does not presuppose it as a condition and as given (datum), but merely as conditioned, and as capable of being given (dabile).", "Very different is the case with the problem  â€œHow far the regress, which ascends from the given conditioned to the conditions, must extendâ€; whether I can say  â€œIt is a regress in infinitum,â€ or only â€œin indefinitumâ€; and whether, for example, setting out from the human beings at present alive in the world, I may ascend in the series of their ancestors, in infinitumâ€mr whether all that can be said is, that so far as I have proceeded, I have discovered no empirical ground for considering the series limited, so that I am justified, and indeed, compelled to search for ancestors still further back, although I am not obliged by the idea of reason to presuppose them.", "My answer to this question is  â€œIf the series is given in empirical intuition as a whole, the regress in the series of its internal conditions proceeds in infinitum; but, if only one member of the series is given, from which the regress is to proceed to absolute totality, the regress is possible only in indefinitum.â€ For example, the division of a portion of matter given within certain limitsâ€of a body, that isâ€proceeds in infinitum.", "For, as the condition of this whole is its part, and the condition of the part a part of the part, and so on, and as in this regress of decomposition an unconditioned indivisible member of the series of conditions is not to be found; there are no reasons or grounds in experience for stopping in the division, but, on the contrary, the more remote members of the division are actually and empirically given prior to this division.", "That is to say, the division proceeds to infinity.", "On the other hand, the series of ancestors of any given human being is not given, in its absolute totality, in any experience, and yet the regress proceeds from every genealogical member of this series to one still higher, and does not meet with any empirical limit presenting an absolutely unconditioned member of the series.", "But as the members of such a series are not contained in the empirical intuition of the whole, prior to the regress, this regress does not proceed to infinity, but only in indefinitum, that is, we are called upon to discover other and higher members, which are themselves always conditioned.", "In neither caseâ€the regressus in infinitum, nor the regressus in indefinitum, is the series of conditions to be considered as actually infinite in the object itself.", "This might be true of things in themselves, but it cannot be asserted of phenomena, which, as conditions of each other, are only given in the empirical regress itself.", "Hence, the question no longer is, â€œWhat is the quantity of this series of conditions in itselfâ€is it finite or infinite?â€ for it is nothing in itself; but, â€œHow is the empirical regress to be commenced, and how far ought we to proceed with it?â€ And here a signal distinction in the application of this rule becomes apparent.", "If the whole is given empirically, it is possible to recede in the series of its internal conditions to infinity.", "But if the whole is not given, and can only be given by and through the empirical regress, I can only say  â€œIt is possible to infinity, to proceed to still higher conditions in the series.â€ In the first case, I am justified in asserting that more members are empirically given in the object than I attain to in the regress (of decomposition).", "In the second case, I am justified only in saying, that I can always proceed further in the regress, because no member of the series is given as absolutely conditioned, and thus a higher member is possible, and an inquiry with regard to it is necessary.", "In the one case it is necessary to find other members of the series, in the other it is necessary to inquire for others, inasmuch as experience presents no absolute limitation of the regress.", "For, either you do not possess a perception which absolutely limits your empirical regress, and in this case the regress cannot be regarded as complete; or, you do possess such a limitative perception, in which case it is not a part of your series (for that which limits must be distinct from that which is limited by it), and it is incumbent you to continue your regress up to this condition, and so on.", "These remarks will be placed in their proper light by their application in the following section.", "Section IX.", "Of the Empirical Use of the Regulative Principle of Reason with regard to the Cosmological Ideas  We have shown that no transcendental use can be made either of the conceptions of reason or of understanding.", "We have shown, likewise, that the demand of absolute totality in the series of conditions in the world of sense arises from a transcendental employment of reason, resting on the opinion that phenomena are to be regarded as things in themselves.", "It follows that we are not required to answer the question respecting the absolute quantity of a seriesâ€whether it is in itself limited or unlimited.", "We are only called upon to determine how far we must proceed in the empirical regress from condition to condition, in order to discover, in conformity with the rule of reason, a full and correct answer to the questions proposed by reason itself.", "This principle of reason is hence valid only as a rule for the extension of a possible experienceâ€its invalidity as a principle constitutive of phenomena in themselves having been sufficiently demonstrated.", "And thus, too, the antinomial conflict of reason with itself is completely put an end to; inasmuch as we have not only presented a critical solution of the fallacy lurking in the opposite statements of reason, but have shown the true meaning of the ideas which gave rise to these statements.", "The dialectical principle of reason has, therefore, been changed into a doctrinal principle.", "But in fact, if this principle, in the subjective signification which we have shown to be its only true sense, may be guaranteed as a principle of the unceasing extension of the employment of our understanding, its influence and value are just as great as if it were an axiom for the Ã  priori determination of objects.", "For such an axiom could not exert a stronger influence on the extension and rectification of our knowledge, otherwise than by procuring for the principles of the understanding the most widely expanded employment in the field of experience.", "I. Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Composition of Phenomena in the Universe  Here, as well as in the case of the other cosmological problems, the ground of the regulative principle of reason is the proposition that in our empirical regress no experience of an absolute limit, and consequently no experience of a condition, which is itself absolutely unconditioned, is discoverable.", "And the truth of this proposition itself rests upon the consideration that such an experience must represent to us phenomena as limited by nothing or the mere void, on which our continued regress by means of perception must abutâ€which is impossible.", "Now this proposition, which declares that every condition attained in the empirical regress must itself be considered empirically conditioned, contains the rule in terminis, which requires me, to whatever extent I may have proceeded in the ascending series, always to look for some higher member in the seriesâ€whether this member is to become known to me through experience, or not.", "Nothing further is necessary, then, for the solution of the first cosmological problem, than to decide, whether, in the regress to the unconditioned quantity of the universe (as regards space and time), this never limited ascent ought to be called a regressus in infinitum or indefinitum.", "The general representation which we form in our minds of the series of all past states or conditions of the world, or of all the things which at present exist in it, is itself nothing more than a possible empirical regress, which is cogitatedâ€although in an undetermined mannerâ€in the mind, and which gives rise to the conception of a series of conditions for a given object.", "[60] Now I have a conception of the universe, but not an intuitionâ€that is, not an intuition of it as a whole.", "Thus I cannot infer the magnitude of the regress from the quantity or magnitude of the world, and determine the former by means of the latter; on the contrary, I must first of all form a conception of the quantity or magnitude of the world from the magnitude of the empirical regress.", "But of this regress I know nothing more than that I ought to proceed from every given member of the series of conditions to one still higher.", "But the quantity of the universe is not thereby determined, and we cannot affirm that this regress proceeds in infinitum.", "Such an affirmation would anticipate the members of the series which have not yet been reached, and represent the number of them as beyond the grasp of any empirical synthesis; it would consequently determine the cosmical quantity prior to the regress (although only in a negative manner)â€which is impossible.", "For the world is not given in its totality in any intuition  consequently, its quantity cannot be given prior to the regress.", "It follows that we are unable to make any declaration respecting the cosmical quantity in itselfâ€not even that the regress in it is a regress in infinitum; we must only endeavour to attain to a conception of the quantity of the universe, in conformity with the rule which determines the empirical regress in it.", "But this rule merely requires us never to admit an absolute limit to our seriesâ€how far soever we may have proceeded in it, but always, on the contrary, to subordinate every phenomenon to some other as its condition, and consequently to proceed to this higher phenomenon.", "Such a regress is, therefore, the regressus in indefinitum, which, as not determining a quantity in the object, is clearly distinguishable from the regressus in infinitum.", "[60] The cosmical series can neither be greater nor smaller than the  possible empirical regress, upon which its conception is based.", "And as  this regress cannot be a determinate infinite regress, still less a  determinate finite (absolutely limited), it is evident that we cannot  regard the world as either finite or infinite, because the regress,  which gives us the representation of the world, is neither finite nor  infinite.", "It follows from what we have said that we are not justified in declaring the world to be infinite in space, or as regards past time.", "For this conception of an infinite given quantity is empirical; but we cannot apply the conception of an infinite quantity to the world as an object of the senses.", "I cannot say, â€œThe regress from a given perception to everything limited either in space or time, proceeds in infinitum,â€ for this presupposes an infinite cosmical quantity; neither can I say, â€œIt is finite,â€ for an absolute limit is likewise impossible in experience.", "It follows that I am not entitled to make any assertion at all respecting the whole object of experienceâ€the world of sense; I must limit my declarations to the rule according to which experience or empirical knowledge is to be attained.", "To the question, therefore, respecting the cosmical quantity, the first and negative answer is  â€œThe world has no beginning in time, and no absolute limit in space.â€  For, in the contrary case, it would be limited by a void time on the one hand, and by a void space on the other.", "Now, since the world, as a phenomenon, cannot be thus limited in itself for a phenomenon is not a thing in itself; it must be possible for us to have a perception of this limitation by a void time and a void space.", "But such a perceptionâ€such an experience is impossible; because it has no content.", "Consequently, an absolute cosmical limit is empirically, and therefore absolutely, impossible.", "[61]   [61] The reader will remark that the proof presented above is very  different from the dogmatical demonstration given in the antithesis of  the first antinomy.", "In that demonstration, it was taken for granted  that the world is a thing in itselfâ€given in its totality prior to all  regress, and a determined position in space and time was denied to  itâ€if it was not considered as occupying all time and all space.", "Hence  our conclusion differed from that given above; for we inferred in the  antithesis the actual infinity of the world.", "From this follows the affirmative answer  â€œThe regress in the series of phenomenaâ€as a determination of the cosmical quantity, proceeds in indefinitum.â€ This is equivalent to saying  â€œThe world of sense has no absolute quantity, but the empirical regress (through which alone the world of sense is presented to us on the side of its conditions) rests upon a rule, which requires it to proceed from every member of the series, as conditioned, to one still more remote (whether through personal experience, or by means of history, or the chain of cause and effect), and not to cease at any point in this extension of the possible empirical employment of the understanding.â€ And this is the proper and only use which reason can make of its principles.", "The above rule does not prescribe an unceasing regress in one kind of phenomena.", "It does not, for example, forbid us, in our ascent from an individual human being through the line of his ancestors, to expect that we shall discover at some point of the regress a primeval pair, or to admit, in the series of heavenly bodies, a sun at the farthest possible distance from some centre.", "All that it demands is a perpetual progress from phenomena to phenomena, even although an actual perception is not presented by them (as in the case of our perceptions being so weak as that we are unable to become conscious of them), since they, nevertheless, belong to possible experience.", "Every beginning is in time, and all limits to extension are in space.", "But space and time are in the world of sense.", "Consequently phenomena in the world are conditionally limited, but the world itself is not limited, either conditionally or unconditionally.", "For this reason, and because neither the world nor the cosmical series of conditions to a given conditioned can be completely given, our conception of the cosmical quantity is given only in and through the regress and not prior to itâ€in a collective intuition.", "But the regress itself is really nothing more than the determining of the cosmical quantity, and cannot therefore give us any determined conception of itâ€still less a conception of a quantity which is, in relation to a certain standard, infinite.", "The regress does not, therefore, proceed to infinity (an infinity given), but only to an indefinite extent, for or the of presenting to us a quantityâ€realized only in and through the regress itself.", "II.", "Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Division of a Whole given in Intuition  When I divide a whole which is given in intuition, I proceed from a conditioned to its conditions.", "The division of the parts of the whole (subdivisio or decompositio) is a regress in the series of these conditions.", "The absolute totality of this series would be actually attained and given to the mind, if the regress could arrive at simple parts.", "But if all the parts in a continuous decomposition are themselves divisible, the division, that is to say, the regress, proceeds from the conditioned to its conditions in infinitum; because the conditions (the parts) are themselves contained in the conditioned, and, as the latter is given in a limited intuition, the former are all given along with it.", "This regress cannot, therefore, be called a regressus in indefinitum, as happened in the case of the preceding cosmological idea, the regress in which proceeded from the conditioned to the conditions not given contemporaneously and along with it, but discoverable only through the empirical regress.", "We are not, however, entitled to affirm of a whole of this kind, which is divisible in infinitum, that it consists of an infinite number of parts.", "For, although all the parts are contained in the intuition of the whole, the whole division is not contained therein.", "The division is contained only in the progressing decompositionâ€in the regress itself, which is the condition of the possibility and actuality of the series.", "Now, as this regress is infinite, all the members (parts) to which it attains must be contained in the given whole as an aggregate.", "But the complete series of division is not contained therein.", "For this series, being infinite in succession and always incomplete, cannot represent an infinite number of members, and still less a composition of these members into a whole.", "To apply this remark to space.", "Every limited part of space presented to intuition is a whole, the parts of which are always spacesâ€to whatever extent subdivided.", "Every limited space is hence divisible to infinity.", "Let us again apply the remark to an external phenomenon enclosed in limits, that is, a body.", "The divisibility of a body rests upon the divisibility of space, which is the condition of the possibility of the body as an extended whole.", "A body is consequently divisible to infinity, though it does not, for that reason, consist of an infinite number of parts.", "It certainly seems that, as a body must be cogitated as substance in space, the law of divisibility would not be applicable to it as substance.", "For we may and ought to grant, in the case of space, that division or decomposition, to any extent, never can utterly annihilate composition (that is to say, the smallest part of space must still consist of spaces); otherwise space would entirely cease to existâ€which is impossible.", "But, the assertion on the other band that when all composition in matter is annihilated in thought, nothing remains, does not seem to harmonize with the conception of substance, which must be properly the subject of all composition and must remain, even after the conjunction of its attributes in spaceâ€which constituted a bodyâ€is annihilated in thought.", "But this is not the case with substance in the phenomenal world, which is not a thing in itself cogitated by the pure category.", "Phenomenal substance is not an absolute subject; it is merely a permanent sensuous image, and nothing more than an intuition, in which the unconditioned is not to be found.", "But, although this rule of progress to infinity is legitimate and applicable to the subdivision of a phenomenon, as a mere occupation or filling of space, it is not applicable to a whole consisting of a number of distinct parts and constituting a quantum discretumâ€that is to say, an organized body.", "It cannot be admitted that every part in an organized whole is itself organized, and that, in analysing it to infinity, we must always meet with organized parts; although we may allow that the parts of the matter which we decompose in infinitum, may be organized.", "For the infinity of the division of a phenomenon in space rests altogether on the fact that the divisibility of a phenomenon is given only in and through this infinity, that is, an undetermined number of parts is given, while the parts themselves are given and determined only in and through the subdivision; in a word, the infinity of the division necessarily presupposes that the whole is not already divided in se.", "Hence our division determines a number of parts in the wholeâ€a number which extends just as far as the actual regress in the division; while, on the other hand, the very notion of a body organized to infinity represents the whole as already and in itself divided.", "We expect, therefore, to find in it a determinate, but at the same time, infinite, number of partsâ€which is self contradictory.", "For we should thus have a whole containing a series of members which could not be completed in any regressâ€which is infinite, and at the same time complete in an organized composite.", "Infinite divisibility is applicable only to a quantum continuum, and is based entirely on the infinite divisibility of space, But in a quantum discretum the multitude of parts or units is always determined, and hence always equal to some number.", "To what extent a body may be organized, experience alone can inform us; and although, so far as our experience of this or that body has extended, we may not have discovered any inorganic part, such parts must exist in possible experience.", "But how far the transcendental division of a phenomenon must extend, we cannot know from experienceâ€it is a question which experience cannot answer; it is answered only by the principle of reason which forbids us to consider the empirical regress, in the analysis of extended body, as ever absolutely complete.", "Concluding Remark on the Solution of the Transcendental Mathematical Ideasâ€and Introductory to the Solution of the Dynamical Ideas.", "We presented the antinomy of pure reason in a tabular form, and we endeavoured to show the ground of this self contradiction on the part of reason, and the only means of bringing it to a conclusionâ€namely, by declaring both contradictory statements to be false.", "We represented in these antinomies the conditions of phenomena as belonging to the conditioned according to relations of space and timeâ€which is the usual supposition of the common understanding.", "In this respect, all dialectical representations of totality, in the series of conditions to a given conditioned, were perfectly homogeneous.", "The condition was always a member of the series along with the conditioned, and thus the homogeneity of the whole series was assured.", "In this case the regress could never be cogitated as complete; or, if this was the case, a member really conditioned was falsely regarded as a primal member, consequently as unconditioned.", "In such an antinomy, therefore, we did not consider the object, that is, the conditioned, but the series of conditions belonging to the object, and the magnitude of that series.", "And thus arose the difficultyâ€a difficulty not to be settled by any decision regarding the claims of the two parties, but simply by cutting the knotâ€by declaring the series proposed by reason to be either too long or too short for the understanding, which could in neither case make its conceptions adequate with the ideas.", "But we have overlooked, up to this point, an essential difference existing between the conceptions of the understanding which reason endeavours to raise to the rank of ideasâ€two of these indicating a mathematical, and two a dynamical synthesis of phenomena.", "Hitherto, it was necessary to signalize this distinction; for, just as in our general representation of all transcendental ideas, we considered them under phenomenal conditions, so, in the two mathematical ideas, our discussion is concerned solely with an object in the world of phenomena.", "But as we are now about to proceed to the consideration of the dynamical conceptions of the understanding, and their adequateness with ideas, we must not lose sight of this distinction.", "We shall find that it opens up to us an entirely new view of the conflict in which reason is involved.", "For, while in the first two antinomies, both parties were dismissed, on the ground of having advanced statements based upon false hypothesis; in the present case the hope appears of discovering a hypothesis which may be consistent with the demands of reason, and, the judge completing the statement of the grounds of claim, which both parties had left in an unsatisfactory state, the question may be settled on its own merits, not by dismissing the claimants, but by a comparison of the arguments on both sides.", "If we consider merely their extension, and whether they are adequate with ideas, the series of conditions may be regarded as all homogeneous.", "But the conception of the understanding which lies at the basis of these ideas, contains either a synthesis of the homogeneous (presupposed in every quantityâ€in its composition as well as in its division) or of the heterogeneous, which is the case in the dynamical synthesis of cause and effect, as well as of the necessary and the contingent.", "Thus it happens that in the mathematical series of phenomena no other than a sensuous condition is admissibleâ€a condition which is itself a member of the series; while the dynamical series of sensuous conditions admits a heterogeneous condition, which is not a member of the series, but, as purely intelligible, lies out of and beyond it.", "And thus reason is satisfied, and an unconditioned placed at the head of the series of phenomena, without introducing confusion into or discontinuing it, contrary to the principles of the understanding.", "Now, from the fact that the dynamical ideas admit a condition of phenomena which does not form a part of the series of phenomena, arises a result which we should not have expected from an antinomy.", "In former cases, the result was that both contradictory dialectical statements were declared to be false.", "In the present case, we find the conditioned in the dynamical series connected with an empirically unconditioned, but non sensuous condition; and thus satisfaction is done to the understanding on the one hand and to the reason on the other.", "[62] While, moreover, the dialectical arguments for unconditioned totality in mere phenomena fall to the ground, both propositions of reason may be shown to be true in their proper signification.", "This could not happen in the case of the cosmological ideas which demanded a mathematically unconditioned unity; for no condition could be placed at the head of the series of phenomena, except one which was itself a phenomenon and consequently a member of the series.", "[62] For the understanding cannot admit among phenomena a condition  which is itself empirically unconditioned.", "But if it is possible to  cogitate an intelligible conditionâ€one which is not a member of the  series of phenomenaâ€for a conditioned phenomenon, without breaking the  series of empirical conditions, such a condition may be admissible as  empirically unconditioned, and the empirical regress continue regular,  unceasing, and intact.", "III.", "Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Deduction of Cosmical Events from their Causes  There are only two modes of causality cogitableâ€the causality of nature or of freedom.", "The first is the conjunction of a particular state with another preceding it in the world of sense, the former following the latter by virtue of a law.", "Now, as the causality of phenomena is subject to conditions of time, and the preceding state, if it had always existed, could not have produced an effect which would make its first appearance at a particular time, the causality of a cause must itself be an effectâ€must itself have begun to be, and therefore, according to the principle of the understanding, itself requires a cause.", "We must understand, on the contrary, by the term freedom, in the cosmological sense, a faculty of the spontaneous origination of a state; the causality of which, therefore, is not subordinated to another cause determining it in time.", "Freedom is in this sense a pure transcendental idea, which, in the first place, contains no empirical element; the object of which, in the second place, cannot be given or determined in any experience, because it is a universal law of the very possibility of experience, that everything which happens must have a cause, that consequently the causality of a cause, being itself something that has happened, must also have a cause.", "In this view of the case, the whole field of experience, how far soever it may extend, contains nothing that is not subject to the laws of nature.", "But, as we cannot by this means attain to an absolute totality of conditions in reference to the series of causes and effects, reason creates the idea of a spontaneity, which can begin to act of itself, and without any external cause determining it to action, according to the natural law of causality.", "It is especially remarkable that the practical conception of freedom is based upon the transcendental idea, and that the question of the possibility of the former is difficult only as it involves the consideration of the truth of the latter.", "Freedom, in the practical sense, is the independence of the will of coercion by sensuous impulses.", "A will is sensuous, in so far as it is pathologically affected (by sensuous impulses); it is termed animal (arbitrium brutum), when it is pathologically necessitated.", "The human will is certainly an arbitrium sensitivum, not brutum, but liberum; because sensuousness does not necessitate its action, a faculty existing in man of self determination, independently of all sensuous coercion.", "It is plain that, if all causality in the world of sense were naturalâ€and natural onlyâ€every event would be determined by another according to necessary laws, and that, consequently, phenomena, in so far as they determine the will, must necessitate every action as a natural effect from themselves; and thus all practical freedom would fall to the ground with the transcendental idea.", "For the latter presupposes that although a certain thing has not happened, it ought to have happened, and that, consequently, its phenomenal cause was not so powerful and determinative as to exclude the causality of our willâ€a causality capable of producing effects independently of and even in opposition to the power of natural causes, and capable, consequently, of spontaneously originating a series of events.", "Here, too, we find it to be the case, as we generally found in the self contradictions and perplexities of a reason which strives to pass the bounds of possible experience, that the problem is properly not physiological, but transcendental.", "The question of the possibility of freedom does indeed concern psychology; but, as it rests upon dialectical arguments of pure reason, its solution must engage the attention of transcendental philosophy.", "Before attempting this solution, a task which transcendental philosophy cannot decline, it will be advisable to make a remark with regard to its procedure in the settlement of the question.", "If phenomena were things in themselves, and time and space forms of the existence of things, condition and conditioned would always be members of the same series; and thus would arise in the present case the antinomy common to all transcendental ideasâ€that their series is either too great or too small for the understanding.", "The dynamical ideas, which we are about to discuss in this and the following section, possess the peculiarity of relating to an object, not considered as a quantity, but as an existence; and thus, in the discussion of the present question, we may make abstraction of the quantity of the series of conditions, and consider merely the dynamical relation of the condition to the conditioned.", "The question, then, suggests itself, whether freedom is possible; and, if it is, whether it can consist with the universality of the natural law of causality; and, consequently, whether we enounce a proper disjunctive proposition when we say  â€œEvery effect must have its origin either in nature or in freedom,â€ or whether both cannot exist together in the same event in different relations.", "The principle of an unbroken connection between all events in the phenomenal world, in accordance with the unchangeable laws of nature, is a well established principle of transcendental analytic which admits of no exception.", "The question, therefore, is  â€œWhether an effect, determined according to the laws of nature, can at the same time be produced by a free agent, or whether freedom and nature mutually exclude each other?â€ And here, the common but fallacious hypothesis of the absolute reality of phenomena manifests its injurious influence in embarrassing the procedure of reason.", "For if phenomena are things in themselves, freedom is impossible.", "In this case, nature is the complete and all sufficient cause of every event; and condition and conditioned, cause and effect are contained in the same series, and necessitated by the same law.", "If, on the contrary, phenomena are held to be, as they are in fact, nothing more than mere representations, connected with each other in accordance with empirical laws, they must have a ground which is not phenomenal.", "But the causality of such an intelligible cause is not determined or determinable by phenomena; although its effects, as phenomena, must be determined by other phenomenal existences.", "This cause and its causality exist therefore out of and apart from the series of phenomena; while its effects do exist and are discoverable in the series of empirical conditions.", "Such an effect may therefore be considered to be free in relation to its intelligible cause, and necessary in relation to the phenomena from which it is a necessary consequenceâ€a distinction which, stated in this perfectly general and abstract manner, must appear in the highest degree subtle and obscure.", "The sequel will explain.", "It is sufficient, at present, to remark that, as the complete and unbroken connection of phenomena is an unalterable law of nature, freedom is impossibleâ€on the supposition that phenomena are absolutely real.", "Hence those philosophers who adhere to the common opinion on this subject can never succeed in reconciling the ideas of nature and freedom.", "Possibility of Freedom in Harmony with the Universal Law of Natural Necessity.", "That element in a sensuous object which is not itself sensuous, I may be allowed to term intelligible.", "If, accordingly, an object which must be regarded as a sensuous phenomenon possesses a faculty which is not an object of sensuous intuition, but by means of which it is capable of being the cause of phenomena, the causality of an object or existence of this kind may be regarded from two different points of view.", "It may be considered to be intelligible, as regards its actionâ€the action of a thing which is a thing in itself, and sensuous, as regards its effectsâ€the effects of a phenomenon belonging to the sensuous world.", "We should accordingly, have to form both an empirical and an intellectual conception of the causality of such a faculty or powerâ€both, however, having reference to the same effect.", "This twofold manner of cogitating a power residing in a sensuous object does not run counter to any of the conceptions which we ought to form of the world of phenomena or of a possible experience.", "Phenomenaâ€not being things in themselvesâ€must have a transcendental object as a foundation, which determines them as mere representations; and there seems to be no reason why we should not ascribe to this transcendental object, in addition to the property of self phenomenization, a causality whose effects are to be met with in the world of phenomena, although it is not itself a phenomenon.", "But every effective cause must possess a character, that is to say, a law of its causality, without which it would cease to be a cause.", "In the above case, then, every sensuous object would possess an empirical character, which guaranteed that its actions, as phenomena, stand in complete and harmonious connection, conformably to unvarying natural laws, with all other phenomena, and can be deduced from these, as conditions, and that they do thus, in connection with these, constitute a series in the order of nature.", "This sensuous object must, in the second place, possess an intelligible character, which guarantees it to be the cause of those actions, as phenomena, although it is not itself a phenomenon nor subordinate to the conditions of the world of sense.", "The former may be termed the character of the thing as a phenomenon, the latter the character of the thing as a thing in itself.", "Now this active subject would, in its character of intelligible subject, be subordinate to no conditions of time, for time is only a condition of phenomena, and not of things in themselves.", "No action would begin or cease to be in this subject; it would consequently be free from the law of all determination of timeâ€the law of change, namely, that everything which happens must have a cause in the phenomena of a preceding state.", "In one word, the causality of the subject, in so far as it is intelligible, would not form part of the series of empirical conditions which determine and necessitate an event in the world of sense.", "Again, this intelligible character of a thing cannot be immediately cognized, because we can perceive nothing but phenomena, but it must be capable of being cogitated in harmony with the empirical character; for we always find ourselves compelled to place, in thought, a transcendental object at the basis of phenomena although we can never know what this object is in itself.", "In virtue of its empirical character, this subject would at the same time be subordinate to all the empirical laws of causality, and, as a phenomenon and member of the sensuous world, its effects would have to be accounted for by a reference to preceding phenomena.", "Eternal phenomena must be capable of influencing it; and its actions, in accordance with natural laws, must explain to us how its empirical character, that is, the law of its causality, is to be cognized in and by means of experience.", "In a word, all requisites for a complete and necessary determination of these actions must be presented to us by experience.", "In virtue of its intelligible character, on the other hand (although we possess only a general conception of this character), the subject must be regarded as free from all sensuous influences, and from all phenomenal determination.", "Moreover, as nothing happens in this subjectâ€for it is a noumenon, and there does not consequently exist in it any change, demanding the dynamical determination of time, and for the same reason no connection with phenomena as causesâ€this active existence must in its actions be free from and independent of natural necessity, for or necessity exists only in the world of phenomena.", "It would be quite correct to say that it originates or begins its effects in the world of sense from itself, although the action productive of these effects does not begin in itself.", "We should not be in this case affirming that these sensuous effects began to exist of themselves, because they are always determined by prior empirical conditionsâ€by virtue of the empirical character, which is the phenomenon of the intelligible characterâ€and are possible only as constituting a continuation of the series of natural causes.", "And thus nature and freedom, each in the complete and absolute signification of these terms, can exist, without contradiction or disagreement, in the same action.", "Exposition of the Cosmological Idea of Freedom in Harmony with the Universal Law of Natural Necessity.", "I have thought it advisable to lay before the reader at first merely a sketch of the solution of this transcendental problem, in order to enable him to form with greater ease a clear conception of the course which reason must adopt in the solution.", "I shall now proceed to exhibit the several momenta of this solution, and to consider them in their order.", "The natural law that everything which happens must have a cause, that the causality of this cause, that is, the action of the cause (which cannot always have existed, but must be itself an event, for it precedes in time some effect which it has originated), must have itself a phenomenal cause, by which it is determined and, and, consequently, all events are empirically determined in an order of natureâ€this law, I say, which lies at the foundation of the possibility of experience, and of a connected system of phenomena or nature is a law of the understanding, from which no departure, and to which no exception, can be admitted.", "For to except even a single phenomenon from its operation is to exclude it from the sphere of possible experience and thus to admit it to be a mere fiction of thought or phantom of the brain.", "Thus we are obliged to acknowledge the existence of a chain of causes, in which, however, absolute totality cannot be found.", "But we need not detain ourselves with this question, for it has already been sufficiently answered in our discussion of the antinomies into which reason falls, when it attempts to reach the unconditioned in the series of phenomena.", "If we permit ourselves to be deceived by the illusion of transcendental idealism, we shall find that neither nature nor freedom exists.", "Now the question is  â€œWhether, admitting the existence of natural necessity in the world of phenomena, it is possible to consider an effect as at the same time an effect of nature and an effect of freedomâ€or, whether these two modes of causality are contradictory and incompatible?â€  No phenomenal cause can absolutely and of itself begin a series.", "Every action, in so far as it is productive of an event, is itself an event or occurrence, and presupposes another preceding state, in which its cause existed.", "Thus everything that happens is but a continuation of a series, and an absolute beginning is impossible in the sensuous world.", "The actions of natural causes are, accordingly, themselves effects, and presuppose causes preceding them in time.", "A primal action which forms an absolute beginning, is beyond the causal power of phenomena.", "Now, is it absolutely necessary that, granting that all effects are phenomena, the causality of the cause of these effects must also be a phenomenon and belong to the empirical world?", "Is it not rather possible that, although every effect in the phenomenal world must be connected with an empirical cause, according to the universal law of nature, this empirical causality may be itself the effect of a non empirical and intelligible causalityâ€its connection with natural causes remaining nevertheless intact?", "Such a causality would be considered, in reference to phenomena, as the primal action of a cause, which is in so far, therefore, not phenomenal, but, by reason of this faculty or power, intelligible; although it must, at the same time, as a link in the chain of nature, be regarded as belonging to the sensuous world.", "A belief in the reciprocal causality of phenomena is necessary, if we are required to look for and to present the natural conditions of natural events, that is to say, their causes.", "This being admitted as unexceptionably valid, the requirements of the understanding, which recognizes nothing but nature in the region of phenomena, are satisfied, and our physical explanations of physical phenomena may proceed in their regular course, without hindrance and without opposition.", "But it is no stumbling block in the way, even assuming the idea to be a pure fiction, to admit that there are some natural causes in the possession of a faculty which is not empirical, but intelligible, inasmuch as it is not determined to action by empirical conditions, but purely and solely upon grounds brought forward by the understandingâ€this action being still, when the cause is phenomenized, in perfect accordance with the laws of empirical causality.", "Thus the acting subject, as a causal phenomenon, would continue to preserve a complete connection with nature and natural conditions; and the phenomenon only of the subject (with all its phenomenal causality) would contain certain conditions, which, if we ascend from the empirical to the transcendental object, must necessarily be regarded as intelligible.", "For, if we attend, in our inquiries with regard to causes in the world of phenomena, to the directions of nature alone, we need not trouble ourselves about the relation in which the transcendental subject, which is completely unknown to us, stands to these phenomena and their connection in nature.", "The intelligible ground of phenomena in this subject does not concern empirical questions.", "It has to do only with pure thought; and, although the effects of this thought and action of the pure understanding are discoverable in phenomena, these phenomena must nevertheless be capable of a full and complete explanation, upon purely physical grounds and in accordance with natural laws.", "And in this case we attend solely to their empirical and omit all consideration of their intelligible character (which is the transcendental cause of the former) as completely unknown, except in so far as it is exhibited by the latter as its empirical symbol.", "Now let us apply this to experience.", "Man is a phenomenon of the sensuous world and, at the same time, therefore, a natural cause, the causality of which must be regulated by empirical laws.", "As such, he must possess an empirical character, like all other natural phenomena.", "We remark this empirical character in his actions, which reveal the presence of certain powers and faculties.", "If we consider inanimate or merely animal nature, we can discover no reason for ascribing to ourselves any other than a faculty which is determined in a purely sensuous manner.", "But man, to whom nature reveals herself only through sense, cognizes himself not only by his senses, but also through pure apperception; and this in actions and internal determinations, which he cannot regard as sensuous impressions.", "He is thus to himself, on the one hand, a phenomenon, but on the other hand, in respect of certain faculties, a purely intelligible objectâ€intelligible, because its action cannot be ascribed to sensuous receptivity.", "These faculties are understanding and reason.", "The latter, especially, is in a peculiar manner distinct from all empirically conditioned faculties, for it employs ideas alone in the consideration of its objects, and by means of these determines the understanding, which then proceeds to make an empirical use of its own conceptions, which, like the ideas of reason, are pure and non empirical.", "That reason possesses the faculty of causality, or that at least we are compelled so to represent it, is evident from the imperatives, which in the sphere of the practical we impose on many of our executive powers.", "The words I ought express a species of necessity, and imply a connection with grounds which nature does not and cannot present to the mind of man.", "Understanding knows nothing in nature but that which is, or has been, or will be.", "It would be absurd to say that anything in nature ought to be other than it is in the relations of time in which it stands; indeed, the ought, when we consider merely the course of nature, has neither application nor meaning.", "The question, â€œWhat ought to happen in the sphere of nature?â€ is just as absurd as the question, â€œWhat ought to be the properties of a circle?â€ All that we are entitled to ask is, â€œWhat takes place in nature?â€ or, in the latter case, â€œWhat are the properties of a circle?â€  But the idea of an ought or of duty indicates a possible action, the ground of which is a pure conception; while the ground of a merely natural action is, on the contrary, always a phenomenon.", "This action must certainly be possible under physical conditions, if it is prescribed by the moral imperative ought; but these physical or natural conditions do not concern the determination of the will itself, they relate to its effects alone, and the consequences of the effect in the world of phenomena.", "Whatever number of motives nature may present to my will, whatever sensuous impulsesâ€the moral ought it is beyond their power to produce.", "They may produce a volition, which, so far from being necessary, is always conditionedâ€a volition to which the ought enunciated by reason, sets an aim and a standard, gives permission or prohibition.", "Be the object what it may, purely sensuousâ€as pleasure, or presented by pure reasonâ€as good, reason will not yield to grounds which have an empirical origin.", "Reason will not follow the order of things presented by experience, but, with perfect spontaneity, rearranges them according to ideas, with which it compels empirical conditions to agree.", "It declares, in the name of these ideas, certain actions to be necessary which nevertheless have not taken place and which perhaps never will take place; and yet presupposes that it possesses the faculty of causality in relation to these actions.", "For, in the absence of this supposition, it could not expect its ideas to produce certain effects in the world of experience.", "Now, let us stop here and admit it to be at least possible that reason does stand in a really causal relation to phenomena.", "In this case it mustâ€pure reason as it isâ€exhibit an empirical character.", "For every cause supposes a rule, according to which certain phenomena follow as effects from the cause, and every rule requires uniformity in these effects; and this is the proper ground of the conception of a causeâ€as a faculty or power.", "Now this conception (of a cause) may be termed the empirical character of reason; and this character is a permanent one, while the effects produced appear, in conformity with the various conditions which accompany and partly limit them, in various forms.", "Thus the volition of every man has an empirical character, which is nothing more than the causality of his reason, in so far as its effects in the phenomenal world manifest the presence of a rule, according to which we are enabled to examine, in their several kinds and degrees, the actions of this causality and the rational grounds for these actions, and in this way to decide upon the subjective principles of the volition.", "Now we learn what this empirical character is only from phenomenal effects, and from the rule of these which is presented by experience; and for this reason all the actions of man in the world of phenomena are determined by his empirical character, and the co operative causes of nature.", "If, then, we could investigate all the phenomena of human volition to their lowest foundation in the mind, there would be no action which we could not anticipate with certainty, and recognize to be absolutely necessary from its preceding conditions.", "So far as relates to this empirical character, therefore, there can be no freedom; and it is only in the light of this character that we can consider the human will, when we confine ourselves to simple observation and, as is the case in anthropology, institute a physiological investigation of the motive causes of human actions.", "But when we consider the same actions in relation to reasonâ€not for the purpose of explaining their origin, that is, in relation to speculative reason, but to practical reason, as the producing cause of these actionsâ€we shall discover a rule and an order very different from those of nature and experience.", "For the declaration of this mental faculty may be that what has and could not but take place in the course of nature, ought not to have taken place.", "Sometimes, too, we discover, or believe that we discover, that the ideas of reason did actually stand in a causal relation to certain actions of man; and that these actions have taken place because they were determined, not by empirical causes, but by the act of the will upon grounds of reason.", "Now, granting that reason stands in a causal relation to phenomena; can an action of reason be called free, when we know that, sensuously, in its empirical character, it is completely determined and absolutely necessary?", "But this empirical character is itself determined by the intelligible character.", "The latter we cannot cognize; we can only indicate it by means of phenomena, which enable us to have an immediate cognition only of the empirical character.", "[63] An action, then, in so far as it is to be ascribed to an intelligible cause, does not result from it in accordance with empirical laws.", "That is to say, not the conditions of pure reason, but only their effects in the internal sense, precede the act.", "Pure reason, as a purely intelligible faculty, is not subject to the conditions of time.", "The causality of reason in its intelligible character does not begin to be; it does not make its appearance at a certain time, for the purpose of producing an effect.", "If this were not the case, the causality of reason would be subservient to the natural law of phenomena, which determines them according to time, and as a series of causes and effects in time; it would consequently cease to be freedom and become a part of nature.", "We are therefore justified in saying  â€œIf reason stands in a causal relation to phenomena, it is a faculty which originates the sensuous condition of an empirical series of effects.â€ For the condition, which resides in the reason, is non sensuous, and therefore cannot be originated, or begin to be.", "And thus we findâ€what we could not discover in any empirical seriesâ€a condition of a successive series of events itself empirically unconditioned.", "For, in the present case, the condition stands out of and beyond the series of phenomenaâ€it is intelligible, and it consequently cannot be subjected to any sensuous condition, or to any time determination by a preceding cause.", "[63] The real morality of actionsâ€their merit or demerit, and even  that of our own conduct, is completely unknown to us.", "Our estimates  can relate only to their empirical character.", "How much is the result  of the action of free will, how much is to be ascribed to nature and  to blameless error, or to a happy constitution of temperament (merito  fortunae), no one can discover, nor, for this reason, determine with  perfect justice.", "But, in another respect, the same cause belongs also to the series of phenomena.", "Man is himself a phenomenon.", "His will has an empirical character, which is the empirical cause of all his actions.", "There is no conditionâ€determining man and his volition in conformity with this characterâ€which does not itself form part of the series of effects in nature, and is subject to their lawâ€the law according to which an empirically undetermined cause of an event in time cannot exist.", "For this reason no given action can have an absolute and spontaneous origination, all actions being phenomena, and belonging to the world of experience.", "But it cannot be said of reason, that the state in which it determines the will is always preceded by some other state determining it.", "For reason is not a phenomenon, and therefore not subject to sensuous conditions; and, consequently, even in relation to its causality, the sequence or conditions of time do not influence reason, nor can the dynamical law of nature, which determines the sequence of time according to certain rules, be applied to it.", "Reason is consequently the permanent condition of all actions of the human will.", "Each of these is determined in the empirical character of the man, even before it has taken place.", "The intelligible character, of which the former is but the sensuous schema, knows no before or after; and every action, irrespective of the time relation in which it stands with other phenomena, is the immediate effect of the intelligible character of pure reason, which, consequently, enjoys freedom of action, and is not dynamically determined either by internal or external preceding conditions.", "This freedom must not be described, in a merely negative manner, as independence of empirical conditions, for in this case the faculty of reason would cease to be a cause of phenomena; but it must be regarded, positively, as a faculty which can spontaneously originate a series of events.", "At the same time, it must not be supposed that any beginning can take place in reason; on the contrary, reason, as the unconditioned condition of all action of the will, admits of no time conditions, although its effect does really begin in a series of phenomenaâ€a beginning which is not, however, absolutely primal.", "I shall illustrate this regulative principle of reason by an example, from its employment in the world of experience; proved it cannot be by any amount of experience, or by any number of facts, for such arguments cannot establish the truth of transcendental propositions.", "Let us take a voluntary actionâ€for example, a falsehoodâ€by means of which a man has introduced a certain degree of confusion into the social life of humanity, which is judged according to the motives from which it originated, and the blame of which and of the evil consequences arising from it, is imputed to the offender.", "We at first proceed to examine the empirical character of the offence, and for this purpose we endeavour to penetrate to the sources of that character, such as a defective education, bad company, a shameless and wicked disposition, frivolity, and want of reflectionâ€not forgetting also the occasioning causes which prevailed at the moment of the transgression.", "In this the procedure is exactly the same as that pursued in the investigation of the series of causes which determine a given physical effect.", "Now, although we believe the action to have been determined by all these circumstances, we do not the less blame the offender.", "We do not blame him for his unhappy disposition, nor for the circumstances which influenced him, nay, not even for his former course of life; for we presuppose that all these considerations may be set aside, that the series of preceding conditions may be regarded as having never existed, and that the action may be considered as completely unconditioned in relation to any state preceding, just as if the agent commenced with it an entirely new series of effects.", "Our blame of the offender is grounded upon a law of reason, which requires us to regard this faculty as a cause, which could have and ought to have otherwise determined the behaviour of the culprit, independently of all empirical conditions.", "This causality of reason we do not regard as a co operating agency, but as complete in itself.", "It matters not whether the sensuous impulses favoured or opposed the action of this causality, the offence is estimated according to its intelligible characterâ€the offender is decidedly worthy of blame, the moment he utters a falsehood.", "It follows that we regard reason, in spite of the empirical conditions of the act, as completely free, and therefore, therefore, as in the present case, culpable.", "The above judgement is complete evidence that we are accustomed to think that reason is not affected by sensuous conditions, that in it no change takes placeâ€although its phenomena, in other words, the mode in which it appears in its effects, are subject to changeâ€that in it no preceding state determines the following, and, consequently, that it does not form a member of the series of sensuous conditions which necessitate phenomena according to natural laws.", "Reason is present and the same in all human actions and at all times; but it does not itself exist in time, and therefore does not enter upon any state in which it did not formerly exist.", "It is, relatively to new states or conditions, determining, but not determinable.", "Hence we cannot ask  â€œWhy did not reason determine itself in a different manner?â€ The question ought to be thus stated  â€œWhy did not reason employ its power of causality to determine certain phenomena in a different manner?â€ But this is a question which admits of no answer.", "For a different intelligible character would have exhibited a different empirical character; and, when we say that, in spite of the course which his whole former life has taken, the offender could have refrained from uttering the falsehood, this means merely that the act was subject to the power and authorityâ€permissive or prohibitiveâ€of reason.", "Now, reason is not subject in its causality to any conditions of phenomena or of time; and a difference in time may produce a difference in the relation of phenomena to each otherâ€for these are not things and therefore not causes in themselvesâ€but it cannot produce any difference in the relation in which the action stands to the faculty of reason.", "Thus, then, in our investigation into free actions and the causal power which produced them, we arrive at an intelligible cause, beyond which, however, we cannot go; although we can recognize that it is free, that is, independent of all sensuous conditions, and that, in this way, it may be the sensuously unconditioned condition of phenomena.", "But for what reason the intelligible character generates such and such phenomena and exhibits such and such an empirical character under certain circumstances, it is beyond the power of our reason to decide.", "The question is as much above the power and the sphere of reason as the following would be  â€œWhy does the transcendental object of our external sensuous intuition allow of no other form than that of intuition in space?â€ But the problem, which we were called upon to solve, does not require us to entertain any such questions.", "The problem was merely thisâ€whether freedom and natural necessity can exist without opposition in the same action.", "To this question we have given a sufficient answer; for we have shown that, as the former stands in a relation to a different kind of condition from those of the latter, the law of the one does not affect the law of the other and that, consequently, both can exist together in independence of and without interference with each other.", "The reader must be careful to remark that my intention in the above remarks has not been to prove the actual existence of freedom, as a faculty in which resides the cause of certain sensuous phenomena.", "For, not to mention that such an argument would not have a transcendental character, nor have been limited to the discussion of pure conceptionsâ€all attempts at inferring from experience what cannot be cogitated in accordance with its laws, must ever be unsuccessful.", "Nay, more, I have not even aimed at demonstrating the possibility of freedom; for this too would have been a vain endeavour, inasmuch as it is beyond the power of the mind to cognize the possibility of a reality or of a causal power by the aid of mere Ã  priori conceptions.", "Freedom has been considered in the foregoing remarks only as a transcendental idea, by means of which reason aims at originating a series of conditions in the world of phenomena with the help of that which is sensuously unconditioned, involving itself, however, in an antinomy with the laws which itself prescribes for the conduct of the understanding.", "That this antinomy is based upon a mere illusion, and that nature and freedom are at least not opposedâ€this was the only thing in our power to prove, and the question which it was our task to solve.", "IV.", "Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Dependence of Phenomenal Existences  In the preceding remarks, we considered the changes in the world of sense as constituting a dynamical series, in which each member is subordinated to anotherâ€as its cause.", "Our present purpose is to avail ourselves of this series of states or conditions as a guide to an existence which may be the highest condition of all changeable phenomena, that is, to a necessary being.", "Our endeavour to reach, not the unconditioned causality, but the unconditioned existence, of substance.", "The series before us is therefore a series of conceptions, and not of intuitions (in which the one intuition is the condition of the other).", "But it is evident that, as all phenomena are subject to change and conditioned in their existence, the series of dependent existences cannot embrace an unconditioned member, the existence of which would be absolutely necessary.", "It follows that, if phenomena were things in themselves, andâ€as an immediate consequence from this suppositionâ€condition and conditioned belonged to the same series of phenomena, the existence of a necessary being, as the condition of the existence of sensuous phenomena, would be perfectly impossible.", "An important distinction, however, exists between the dynamical and the mathematical regress.", "The latter is engaged solely with the combination of parts into a whole, or with the division of a whole into its parts; and therefore are the conditions of its series parts of the series, and to be consequently regarded as homogeneous, and for this reason, as consisting, without exception, of phenomena.", "If the former regress, on the contrary, the aim of which is not to establish the possibility of an unconditioned whole consisting of given parts, or of an unconditioned part of a given whole, but to demonstrate the possibility of the deduction of a certain state from its cause, or of the contingent existence of substance from that which exists necessarily, it is not requisite that the condition should form part of an empirical series along with the conditioned.", "In the case of the apparent antinomy with which we are at present dealing, there exists a way of escape from the difficulty; for it is not impossible that both of the contradictory statements may be true in different relations.", "All sensuous phenomena may be contingent, and consequently possess only an empirically conditioned existence, and yet there may also exist a non empirical condition of the whole series, or, in other words, a necessary being.", "For this necessary being, as an intelligible condition, would not form a memberâ€not even the highest memberâ€of the series; the whole world of sense would be left in its empirically determined existence uninterfered with and uninfluenced.", "This would also form a ground of distinction between the modes of solution employed for the third and fourth antinomies.", "For, while in the consideration of freedom in the former antinomy, the thing itselfâ€the cause (substantia phaenomenon)â€was regarded as belonging to the series of conditions, and only its causality to the intelligible worldâ€we are obliged in the present case to cogitate this necessary being as purely intelligible and as existing entirely apart from the world of sense (as an ens extramundanum); for otherwise it would be subject to the phenomenal law of contingency and dependence.", "In relation to the present problem, therefore, the regulative principle of reason is that everything in the sensuous world possesses an empirically conditioned existenceâ€that no property of the sensuous world possesses unconditioned necessityâ€that we are bound to expect, and, so far as is possible, to seek for the empirical condition of every member in the series of conditionsâ€and that there is no sufficient reason to justify us in deducing any existence from a condition which lies out of and beyond the empirical series, or in regarding any existence as independent and self subsistent; although this should not prevent us from recognizing the possibility of the whole series being based upon a being which is intelligible, and for this reason free from all empirical conditions.", "But it has been far from my intention, in these remarks, to prove the existence of this unconditioned and necessary being, or even to evidence the possibility of a purely intelligible condition of the existence or all sensuous phenomena.", "As bounds were set to reason, to prevent it from leaving the guiding thread of empirical conditions and losing itself in transcendent theories which are incapable of concrete presentation; so it was my purpose, on the other band, to set bounds to the law of the purely empirical understanding, and to protest against any attempts on its part at deciding on the possibility of things, or declaring the existence of the intelligible to be impossible, merely on the ground that it is not available for the explanation and exposition of phenomena.", "It has been shown, at the same time, that the contingency of all the phenomena of nature and their empirical conditions is quite consistent with the arbitrary hypothesis of a necessary, although purely intelligible condition, that no real contradiction exists between them and that, consequently, both may be true.", "The existence of such an absolutely necessary being may be impossible; but this can never be demonstrated from the universal contingency and dependence of sensuous phenomena, nor from the principle which forbids us to discontinue the series at some member of it, or to seek for its cause in some sphere of existence beyond the world of nature.", "Reason goes its way in the empirical world, and follows, too, its peculiar path in the sphere of the transcendental.", "The sensuous world contains nothing but phenomena, which are mere representations, and always sensuously conditioned; things in themselves are not, and cannot be, objects to us.", "It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that we are not justified in leaping from some member of an empirical series beyond the world of sense, as if empirical representations were things in themselves, existing apart from their transcendental ground in the human mind, and the cause of whose existence may be sought out of the empirical series.", "This would certainly be the case with contingent things; but it cannot be with mere representations of things, the contingency of which is itself merely a phenomenon and can relate to no other regress than that which determines phenomena, that is, the empirical.", "But to cogitate an intelligible ground of phenomena, as free, moreover, from the contingency of the latter, conflicts neither with the unlimited nature of the empirical regress, nor with the complete contingency of phenomena.", "And the demonstration of this was the only thing necessary for the solution of this apparent antinomy.", "For if the condition of every conditionedâ€as regards its existenceâ€is sensuous, and for this reason a part of the same series, it must be itself conditioned, as was shown in the antithesis of the fourth antinomy.", "The embarrassments into which a reason, which postulates the unconditioned, necessarily falls, must, therefore, continue to exist; or the unconditioned must be placed in the sphere of the intelligible.", "In this way, its necessity does not require, nor does it even permit, the presence of an empirical condition  and it is, consequently, unconditionally necessary.", "The empirical employment of reason is not affected by the assumption of a purely intelligible being; it continues its operations on the principle of the contingency of all phenomena, proceeding from empirical conditions to still higher and higher conditions, themselves empirical.", "Just as little does this regulative principle exclude the assumption of an intelligible cause, when the question regards merely the pure employment of reasonâ€in relation to ends or aims.", "For, in this case, an intelligible cause signifies merely the transcendental and to us unknown ground of the possibility of sensuous phenomena, and its existence, necessary and independent of all sensuous conditions, is not inconsistent with the contingency of phenomena, or with the unlimited possibility of regress which exists in the series of empirical conditions.", "Concluding Remarks on the Antinomy of Pure Reason.", "So long as the object of our rational conceptions is the totality of conditions in the world of phenomena, and the satisfaction, from this source, of the requirements of reason, so long are our ideas transcendental and cosmological.", "But when we set the unconditionedâ€which is the aim of all our inquiriesâ€in a sphere which lies out of the world of sense and possible experience, our ideas become transcendent.", "They are then not merely serviceable towards the completion of the exercise of reason (which remains an idea, never executed, but always to be pursued); they detach themselves completely from experience and construct for themselves objects, the material of which has not been presented by experience, and the objective reality of which is not based upon the completion of the empirical series, but upon pure Ã  priori conceptions.", "The intelligible object of these transcendent ideas may be conceded, as a transcendental object.", "But we cannot cogitate it as a thing determinable by certain distinct predicates relating to its internal nature, for it has no connection with empirical conceptions; nor are we justified in affirming the existence of any such object.", "It is, consequently, a mere product of the mind alone.", "Of all the cosmological ideas, however, it is that occasioning the fourth antinomy which compels us to venture upon this step.", "For the existence of phenomena, always conditioned and never self subsistent, requires us to look for an object different from phenomenaâ€an intelligible object, with which all contingency must cease.", "But, as we have allowed ourselves to assume the existence of a self subsistent reality out of the field of experience, and are therefore obliged to regard phenomena as merely a contingent mode of representing intelligible objects employed by beings which are themselves intelligencesâ€no other course remains for us than to follow analogy and employ the same mode in forming some conception of intelligible things, of which we have not the least knowledge, which nature taught us to use in the formation of empirical conceptions.", "Experience made us acquainted with the contingent.", "But we are at present engaged in the discussion of things which are not objects of experience; and must, therefore, deduce our knowledge of them from that which is necessary absolutely and in itself, that is, from pure conceptions.", "Hence the first step which we take out of the world of sense obliges us to begin our system of new cognition with the investigation of a necessary being, and to deduce from our conceptions of it all our conceptions of intelligible things.", "This we propose to attempt in the following chapter.", "Chapter III.", "The Ideal of Pure Reason  Section I. Of the Ideal in General  We have seen that pure conceptions do not present objects to the mind, except under sensuous conditions; because the conditions of objective reality do not exist in these conceptions, which contain, in fact, nothing but the mere form of thought.", "They may, however, when applied to phenomena, be presented in concreto; for it is phenomena that present to them the materials for the formation of empirical conceptions, which are nothing more than concrete forms of the conceptions of the understanding.", "But ideas are still further removed from objective reality than categories; for no phenomenon can ever present them to the human mind in concreto.", "They contain a certain perfection, attainable by no possible empirical cognition; and they give to reason a systematic unity, to which the unity of experience attempts to approximate, but can never completely attain.", "But still further removed than the idea from objective reality is the Ideal, by which term I understand the idea, not in concreto, but in individuoâ€as an individual thing, determinable or determined by the idea alone.", "The idea of humanity in its complete perfection supposes not only the advancement of all the powers and faculties, which constitute our conception of human nature, to a complete attainment of their final aims, but also everything which is requisite for the complete determination of the idea; for of all contradictory predicates, only one can conform with the idea of the perfect man.", "What I have termed an ideal was in Platoâ€™s philosophy an idea of the divine mindâ€an individual object present to its pure intuition, the most perfect of every kind of possible beings, and the archetype of all phenomenal existences.", "Without rising to these speculative heights, we are bound to confess that human reason contains not only ideas, but ideals, which possess, not, like those of Plato, creative, but certainly practical powerâ€as regulative principles, and form the basis of the perfectibility of certain actions.", "Moral conceptions are not perfectly pure conceptions of reason, because an empirical elementâ€of pleasure or painâ€lies at the foundation of them.", "In relation, however, to the principle, whereby reason sets bounds to a freedom which is in itself without law, and consequently when we attend merely to their form, they may be considered as pure conceptions of reason.", "Virtue and wisdom in their perfect purity are ideas.", "But the wise man of the Stoics is an ideal, that is to say, a human being existing only in thought and in complete conformity with the idea of wisdom.", "As the idea provides a rule, so the ideal serves as an archetype for the perfect and complete determination of the copy.", "Thus the conduct of this wise and divine man serves us as a standard of action, with which we may compare and judge ourselves, which may help us to reform ourselves, although the perfection it demands can never be attained by us.", "Although we cannot concede objective reality to these ideals, they are not to be considered as chimeras; on the contrary, they provide reason with a standard, which enables it to estimate, by comparison, the degree of incompleteness in the objects presented to it.", "But to aim at realizing the ideal in an example in the world of experienceâ€to describe, for instance, the character of the perfectly wise man in a romanceâ€is impracticable.", "Nay more, there is something absurd in the attempt; and the result must be little edifying, as the natural limitations, which are continually breaking in upon the perfection and completeness of the idea, destroy the illusion in the story and throw an air of suspicion even on what is good in the idea, which hence appears fictitious and unreal.", "Such is the constitution of the ideal of reason, which is always based upon determinate conceptions, and serves as a rule and a model for limitation or of criticism.", "Very different is the nature of the ideals of the imagination.", "Of these it is impossible to present an intelligible conception; they are a kind of monogram, drawn according to no determinate rule, and forming rather a vague pictureâ€the production of many diverse experiencesâ€than a determinate image.", "Such are the ideals which painters and physiognomists profess to have in their minds, and which can serve neither as a model for production nor as a standard for appreciation.", "They may be termed, though improperly, sensuous ideals, as they are declared to be models of certain possible empirical intuitions.", "They cannot, however, furnish rules or standards for explanation or examination.", "In its ideals, reason aims at complete and perfect determination according to Ã  priori rules; and hence it cogitates an object, which must be completely determinable in conformity with principles, although all empirical conditions are absent, and the conception of the object is on this account transcendent.", "Section II.", "Of the Transcendental Ideal (Prototypon Trancendentale)  Every conception is, in relation to that which is not contained in it, undetermined and subject to the principle of determinability.", "This principle is that, of every two contradictorily opposed predicates, only one can belong to a conception.", "It is a purely logical principle, itself based upon the principle of contradiction; inasmuch as it makes complete abstraction of the content and attends merely to the logical form of the cognition.", "But again, everything, as regards its possibility, is also subject to the principle of complete determination, according to which one of all the possible contradictory predicates of things must belong to it.", "This principle is not based merely upon that of contradiction; for, in addition to the relation between two contradictory predicates, it regards everything as standing in a relation to the sum of possibilities, as the sum total of all predicates of things, and, while presupposing this sum as an Ã  priori condition, presents to the mind everything as receiving the possibility of its individual existence from the relation it bears to, and the share it possesses in, the aforesaid sum of possibilities.", "[64] The principle of complete determination relates the content and not to the logical form.", "It is the principle of the synthesis of all the predicates which are required to constitute the complete conception of a thing, and not a mere principle analytical representation, which enounces that one of two contradictory predicates must belong to a conception.", "It contains, moreover, a transcendental presuppositionâ€that, namely, of the material for all possibility, which must contain Ã  priori the data for this or that particular possibility.", "[64] Thus this principle declares everything to possess a relation to  a common correlateâ€the sum total of possibility, which, if discovered  to exist in the idea of one individual thing, would establish the  affinity of all possible things, from the identity of the ground of  their complete determination.", "The determinability of every conception  is subordinate to the universality (Allgemeinheit, universalitas) of  the principle of excluded middle; the determination of a thing to the  totality (Allheit, universitas) of all possible predicates.", "The proposition, everything which exists is completely determined, means not only that one of every pair of given contradictory attributes, but that one of all possible attributes, is always predicable of the thing; in it the predicates are not merely compared logically with each other, but the thing itself is transcendentally compared with the sum total of all possible predicates.", "The proposition is equivalent to saying  â€œTo attain to a complete knowledge of a thing, it is necessary to possess a knowledge of everything that is possible, and to determine it thereby in a positive or negative manner.â€ The conception of complete determination is consequently a conception which cannot be presented in its totality in concreto, and is therefore based upon an idea, which has its seat in the reasonâ€the faculty which prescribes to the understanding the laws of its harmonious and perfect exercise.", "Now, although this idea of the sum total of all possibility, in so far as it forms the condition of the complete determination of everything, is itself undetermined in relation to the predicates which may constitute this sum total, and we cogitate in it merely the sum total of all possible predicatesâ€we nevertheless find, upon closer examination, that this idea, as a primitive conception of the mind, excludes a large number of predicatesâ€those deduced and those irreconcilable with others, and that it is evolved as a conception completely determined Ã  priori.", "Thus it becomes the conception of an individual object, which is completely determined by and through the mere idea, and must consequently be termed an ideal of pure reason.", "When we consider all possible predicates, not merely logically, but transcendentally, that is to say, with reference to the content which may be cogitated as existing in them Ã  priori, we shall find that some indicate a being, others merely a non being.", "The logical negation expressed in the word not does not properly belong to a conception, but only to the relation of one conception to another in a judgement, and is consequently quite insufficient to present to the mind the content of a conception.", "The expression not mortal does not indicate that a non being is cogitated in the object; it does not concern the content at all.", "A transcendental negation, on the contrary, indicates non being in itself, and is opposed to transcendental affirmation, the conception of which of itself expresses a being.", "Hence this affirmation indicates a reality, because in and through it objects are considered to be somethingâ€to be things; while the opposite negation, on the other band, indicates a mere want, or privation, or absence, and, where such negations alone are attached to a representation, the non existence of anything corresponding to the representation.", "Now a negation cannot be cogitated as determined, without cogitating at the same time the opposite affirmation.", "The man born blind has not the least notion of darkness, because he has none of light; the vagabond knows nothing of poverty, because he has never known what it is to be in comfort;[65] the ignorant man has no conception of his ignorance, because he has no conception of knowledge.", "All conceptions of negatives are accordingly derived or deduced conceptions; and realities contain the data, and, so to speak, the material or transcendental content of the possibility and complete determination of all things.", "[65] The investigations and calculations of astronomers have taught us  much that is wonderful; but the most important lesson we have received  from them is the discovery of the abyss of our ignorance in relation  to the universeâ€an ignorance the magnitude of which reason, without  the information thus derived, could never have conceived.", "This  discovery of our deficiencies must produce a great change in the  determination of the aims of human reason.", "If, therefore, a transcendental substratum lies at the foundation of the complete determination of thingsâ€a substratum which is to form the fund from which all possible predicates of things are to be supplied, this substratum cannot be anything else than the idea of a sum total of reality (omnitudo realitatis).", "In this view, negations are nothing but limitationsâ€a term which could not, with propriety, be applied to them, if the unlimited (the all) did not form the true basis of our conception.", "This conception of a sum total of reality is the conception of a thing in itself, regarded as completely determined; and the conception of an ens realissimum is the conception of an individual being, inasmuch as it is determined by that predicate of all possible contradictory predicates, which indicates and belongs to being.", "It is, therefore, a transcendental ideal which forms the basis of the complete determination of everything that exists, and is the highest material condition of its possibilityâ€a condition on which must rest the cogitation of all objects with respect to their content.", "Nay, more, this ideal is the only proper ideal of which the human mind is capable; because in this case alone a general conception of a thing is completely determined by and through itself, and cognized as the representation of an individuum.", "The logical determination of a conception is based upon a disjunctive syllogism, the major of which contains the logical division of the extent of a general conception, the minor limits this extent to a certain part, while the conclusion determines the conception by this part.", "The general conception of a reality cannot be divided Ã  priori, because, without the aid of experience, we cannot know any determinate kinds of reality, standing under the former as the genus.", "The transcendental principle of the complete determination of all things is therefore merely the representation of the sum total of all reality; it is not a conception which is the genus of all predicates under itself, but one which comprehends them all within itself.", "The complete determination of a thing is consequently based upon the limitation of this total of reality, so much being predicated of the thing, while all that remains over is excludedâ€a procedure which is in exact agreement with that of the disjunctive syllogism and the determination of the objects in the conclusion by one of the members of the division.", "It follows that reason, in laying the transcendental ideal at the foundation of its determination of all possible things, takes a course in exact analogy with that which it pursues in disjunctive syllogismsâ€a proposition which formed the basis of the systematic division of all transcendental ideas, according to which they are produced in complete parallelism with the three modes of syllogistic reasoning employed by the human mind.", "It is self evident that reason, in cogitating the necessary complete determination of things, does not presuppose the existence of a being corresponding to its ideal, but merely the idea of the idealâ€for the purpose of deducing from the unconditional totality of complete determination, The ideal is therefore the prototype of all things, which, as defective copies (ectypa), receive from it the material of their possibility, and approximate to it more or less, though it is impossible that they can ever attain to its perfection.", "The possibility of things must therefore be regarded as derivedâ€except that of the thing which contains in itself all reality, which must be considered to be primitive and original.", "For all negationsâ€and they are the only predicates by means of which all other things can be distinguished from the ens realissimumâ€are mere limitations of a greater and a higherâ€nay, the highest reality; and they consequently presuppose this reality, and are, as regards their content, derived from it.", "The manifold nature of things is only an infinitely various mode of limiting the conception of the highest reality, which is their common substratum; just as all figures are possible only as different modes of limiting infinite space.", "The object of the ideal of reasonâ€an object existing only in reason itselfâ€is also termed the primal being (ens originarium); as having no existence superior to him, the supreme being (ens summum); and as being the condition of all other beings, which rank under it, the being of all beings (ens entium).", "But none of these terms indicate the objective relation of an actually existing object to other things, but merely that of an idea to conceptions; and all our investigations into this subject still leave us in perfect uncertainty with regard to the existence of this being.", "A primal being cannot be said to consist of many other beings with an existence which is derivative, for the latter presuppose the former, and therefore cannot be constitutive parts of it.", "It follows that the ideal of the primal being must be cogitated as simple.", "The deduction of the possibility of all other things from this primal being cannot, strictly speaking, be considered as a limitation, or as a kind of division of its reality; for this would be regarding the primal being as a mere aggregateâ€which has been shown to be impossible, although it was so represented in our first rough sketch.", "The highest reality must be regarded rather as the ground than as the sum total of the possibility of all things, and the manifold nature of things be based, not upon the limitation of the primal being itself, but upon the complete series of effects which flow from it.", "And thus all our powers of sense, as well as all phenomenal reality, phenomenal reality, may be with propriety regarded as belonging to this series of effects, while they could not have formed parts of the idea, considered as an aggregate.", "Pursuing this track, and hypostatizing this idea, we shall find ourselves authorized to determine our notion of the Supreme Being by means of the mere conception of a highest reality, as one, simple, all sufficient, eternal, and so onâ€in one word, to determine it in its unconditioned completeness by the aid of every possible predicate.", "The conception of such a being is the conception of God in its transcendental sense, and thus the ideal of pure reason is the object matter of a transcendental theology.", "But, by such an employment of the transcendental idea, we should be over stepping the limits of its validity and purpose.", "For reason placed it, as the conception of all reality, at the basis of the complete determination of things, without requiring that this conception be regarded as the conception of an objective existence.", "Such an existence would be purely fictitious, and the hypostatizing of the content of the idea into an ideal, as an individual being, is a step perfectly unauthorized.", "Nay, more, we are not even called upon to assume the possibility of such an hypothesis, as none of the deductions drawn from such an ideal would affect the complete determination of things in generalâ€for the sake of which alone is the idea necessary.", "It is not sufficient to circumscribe the procedure and the dialectic of reason; we must also endeavour to discover the sources of this dialectic, that we may have it in our power to give a rational explanation of this illusion, as a phenomenon of the human mind.", "For the ideal, of which we are at present speaking, is based, not upon an arbitrary, but upon a natural, idea.", "The question hence arises  How happens it that reason regards the possibility of all things as deduced from a single possibility, that, to wit, of the highest reality, and presupposes this as existing in an individual and primal being?", "The answer is ready; it is at once presented by the procedure of transcendental analytic.", "The possibility of sensuous objects is a relation of these objects to thought, in which something (the empirical form) may be cogitated Ã  priori; while that which constitutes the matterâ€the reality of the phenomenon (that element which corresponds to sensation)â€must be given from without, as otherwise it could not even be cogitated by, nor could its possibility be presentable to the mind.", "Now, a sensuous object is completely determined, when it has been compared with all phenomenal predicates, and represented by means of these either positively or negatively.", "But, as that which constitutes the thing itselfâ€the real in a phenomenon, must be given, and that, in which the real of all phenomena is given, is experience, one, sole, and all embracingâ€the material of the possibility of all sensuous objects must be presupposed as given in a whole, and it is upon the limitation of this whole that the possibility of all empirical objects, their distinction from each other and their complete determination, are based.", "Now, no other objects are presented to us besides sensuous objects, and these can be given only in connection with a possible experience; it follows that a thing is not an object to us, unless it presupposes the whole or sum total of empirical reality as the condition of its possibility.", "Now, a natural illusion leads us to consider this principle, which is valid only of sensuous objects, as valid with regard to things in general.", "And thus we are induced to hold the empirical principle of our conceptions of the possibility of things, as phenomena, by leaving out this limitative condition, to be a transcendental principle of the possibility of things in general.", "We proceed afterwards to hypostatize this idea of the sum total of all reality, by changing the distributive unity of the empirical exercise of the understanding into the collective unity of an empirical wholeâ€a dialectical illusion, and by cogitating this whole or sum of experience as an individual thing, containing in itself all empirical reality.", "This individual thing or being is then, by means of the above mentioned transcendental subreption, substituted for our notion of a thing which stands at the head of the possibility of all things, the real conditions of whose complete determination it presents.", "[66]   [66] This ideal of the ens realissimumâ€although merely a mental  representationâ€is first objectivized, that is, has an objective  existence attributed to it, then hypostatized, and finally, by the  natural progress of reason to the completion of unity, personified, as  we shall show presently.", "For the regulative unity of experience is not  based upon phenomena themselves, but upon the connection of the  variety of phenomena by the understanding in a consciousness, and thus  the unity of the supreme reality and the complete determinability of  all things, seem to reside in a supreme understanding, and,  consequently, in a conscious intelligence.", "Section III.", "Of the Arguments employed by Speculative Reason in Proof of the Existence of a Supreme Being  Notwithstanding the pressing necessity which reason feels, to form some presupposition that shall serve the understanding as a proper basis for the complete determination of its conceptions, the idealistic and factitious nature of such a presupposition is too evident to allow reason for a moment to persuade itself into a belief of the objective existence of a mere creation of its own thought.", "But there are other considerations which compel reason to seek out some resting place in the regress from the conditioned to the unconditioned, which is not given as an actual existence from the mere conception of it, although it alone can give completeness to the series of conditions.", "And this is the natural course of every human reason, even of the most uneducated, although the path at first entered it does not always continue to follow.", "It does not begin from conceptions, but from common experience, and requires a basis in actual existence.", "But this basis is insecure, unless it rests upon the immovable rock of the absolutely necessary.", "And this foundation is itself unworthy of trust, if it leave under and above it empty space, if it do not fill all, and leave no room for a why or a wherefore, if it be not, in one word, infinite in its reality.", "If we admit the existence of some one thing, whatever it may be, we must also admit that there is something which exists necessarily.", "For what is contingent exists only under the condition of some other thing, which is its cause; and from this we must go on to conclude the existence of a cause which is not contingent, and which consequently exists necessarily and unconditionally.", "Such is the argument by which reason justifies its advances towards a primal being.", "Now reason looks round for the conception of a being that may be admitted, without inconsistency, to be worthy of the attribute of absolute necessity, not for the purpose of inferring Ã  priori, from the conception of such a being, its objective existence (for if reason allowed itself to take this course, it would not require a basis in given and actual existence, but merely the support of pure conceptions), but for the purpose of discovering, among all our conceptions of possible things, that conception which possesses no element inconsistent with the idea of absolute necessity.", "For that there must be some absolutely necessary existence, it regards as a truth already established.", "Now, if it can remove every existence incapable of supporting the attribute of absolute necessity, excepting oneâ€this must be the absolutely necessary being, whether its necessity is comprehensible by us, that is, deducible from the conception of it alone, or not.", "Now that, the conception of which contains a therefore to every wherefore, which is not defective in any respect whatever, which is all sufficient as a condition, seems to be the being of which we can justly predicate absolute necessityâ€for this reason, that, possessing the conditions of all that is possible, it does not and cannot itself require any condition.", "And thus it satisfies, in one respect at least, the requirements of the conception of absolute necessity.", "In this view, it is superior to all other conceptions, which, as deficient and incomplete, do not possess the characteristic of independence of all higher conditions.", "It is true that we cannot infer from this that what does not contain in itself the supreme and complete conditionâ€the condition of all other thingsâ€must possess only a conditioned existence; but as little can we assert the contrary, for this supposed being does not possess the only characteristic which can enable reason to cognize by means of an Ã  priori conception the unconditioned and necessary nature of its existence.", "The conception of an ens realissimum is that which best agrees with the conception of an unconditioned and necessary being.", "The former conception does not satisfy all the requirements of the latter; but we have no choice, we are obliged to adhere to it, for we find that we cannot do without the existence of a necessary being; and even although we admit it, we find it out of our power to discover in the whole sphere of possibility any being that can advance well grounded claims to such a distinction.", "The following is, therefore, the natural course of human reason.", "It begins by persuading itself of the existence of some necessary being.", "In this being it recognizes the characteristics of unconditioned existence.", "It then seeks the conception of that which is independent of all conditions, and finds it in that which is itself the sufficient condition of all other thingsâ€in other words, in that which contains all reality.", "But the unlimited all is an absolute unity, and is conceived by the mind as a being one and supreme; and thus reason concludes that the Supreme Being, as the primal basis of all things, possesses an existence which is absolutely necessary.", "This conception must be regarded as in some degree satisfactory, if we admit the existence of a necessary being, and consider that there exists a necessity for a definite and final answer to these questions.", "In such a case, we cannot make a better choice, or rather we have no choice at all, but feel ourselves obliged to declare in favour of the absolute unity of complete reality, as the highest source of the possibility of things.", "But if there exists no motive for coming to a definite conclusion, and we may leave the question unanswered till we have fully weighed both sidesâ€in other words, when we are merely called upon to decide how much we happen to know about the question, and how much we merely flatter ourselves that we knowâ€the above conclusion does not appear to be so great advantage, but, on the contrary, seems defective in the grounds upon which it is supported.", "For, admitting the truth of all that has been said, that, namely, the inference from a given existence (my own, for example) to the existence of an unconditioned and necessary being is valid and unassailable; that, in the second place, we must consider a being which contains all reality, and consequently all the conditions of other things, to be absolutely unconditioned; and admitting too, that we have thus discovered the conception of a thing to which may be attributed, without inconsistency, absolute necessityâ€it does not follow from all this that the conception of a limited being, in which the supreme reality does not reside, is therefore incompatible with the idea of absolute necessity.", "For, although I do not discover the element of the unconditioned in the conception of such a beingâ€an element which is manifestly existent in the sum total of all conditionsâ€I am not entitled to conclude that its existence is therefore conditioned; just as I am not entitled to affirm, in a hypothetical syllogism, that where a certain condition does not exist (in the present, completeness, as far as pure conceptions are concerned), the conditioned does not exist either.", "On the contrary, we are free to consider all limited beings as likewise unconditionally necessary, although we are unable to infer this from the general conception which we have of them.", "Thus conducted, this argument is incapable of giving us the least notion of the properties of a necessary being, and must be in every respect without result.", "This argument continues, however, to possess a weight and an authority, which, in spite of its objective insufficiency, it has never been divested of.", "For, granting that certain responsibilities lie upon us, which, as based on the ideas of reason, deserve to be respected and submitted to, although they are incapable of a real or practical application to our nature, or, in other words, would be responsibilities without motives, except upon the supposition of a Supreme Being to give effect and influence to the practical laws  in such a case we should be bound to obey our conceptions, which, although objectively insufficient, do, according to the standard of reason, preponderate over and are superior to any claims that may be advanced from any other quarter.", "The equilibrium of doubt would in this case be destroyed by a practical addition;

suppose the existence of a necessary being as a basis for the empirical regress, and that, as this necessity must be unconditioned and Ã  priori, reason is bound to discover a conception which shall satisfy, if possible, this requirement, and enable us to attain to the Ã  priori cognition of such a being.", "This conception was thought to be found in the idea of an ens realissimum, and thus this idea was employed for the attainment of a better defined knowledge of a necessary being, of the existence of which we were convinced, or persuaded, on other grounds.", "Thus reason was seduced from her natural courage; and, instead of concluding with the conception of an ens realissimum, an attempt was made to begin with it, for the purpose of inferring from it that idea of a necessary existence

of the philosopher.", "The cosmological proof, which we are about to examine, retains the connection between absolute necessity and the highest reality; but, instead of reasoning from this highest reality to a necessary existence, like the preceding argument, it concludes from the given unconditioned necessity of some being its unlimited reality.", "The track it pursues, whether rational or sophistical, is at least natural, and not only goes far to persuade the common understanding, but shows itself deserving of respect from the speculative intellect; while it contains, at the same time, the outlines of all the arguments employed in natural theologyâ€arguments which always have been, and still will be, in use and authority.", "These, however adorned, and hid under whatever embellishments of rhetoric and sentiment, are at bottom identical with the arguments we are at present to discuss.", "This proof, termed by Leibnitz the argumentum a contingentia mundi, I shall now lay before the reader, and subject to a strict examination.", "It is framed in the following manner  If something exists, an absolutely necessary being must likewise exist.", "Now I, at least, exist.", "Consequently, there exists an absolutely necessary being.", "The minor contains an experience, the major reasons from a general experience to the existence of a necessary being.", "[68] Thus this argument really begins at experience, and is not completely Ã  priori, or ontological.", "The object of all possible experience being the world, it is called the cosmological proof.", "It contains no reference to any peculiar property of sensuous objects, by which this world of sense might be distinguished from other possible worlds; and in this respect it differs from the physico theological proof, which is based upon the consideration of the peculiar constitution of our sensuous world.", "[68] This inference is too well known to require more detailed  discussion.", "It is based upon the spurious transcendental law of  causality, that everything which is contingent has a cause, which, if  itself contingent, must also have a cause; and so on, till the series  of subordinated causes must end with an absolutely necessary cause,  without which it would not possess completeness.", "The proof proceeds thus  A necessary being can be determined only in one way, that is, it can be determined by only one of all possible opposed predicates; consequently, it must be completely determined in and by its conception.", "But there is only a single conception of a thing possible, which completely determines the thing Ã  priori  that is, the conception of the ens realissimum.", "It follows that the conception of the ens realissimum is the only conception by and in which we can cogitate a necessary being.", "Consequently, a Supreme Being necessarily exists.", "In this cosmological argument are assembled so many sophistical propositions that speculative reason seems to have exerted in it all her dialectical skill to produce a transcendental illusion of the most extreme character.", "We shall postpone an investigation of this argument for the present, and confine ourselves to exposing the stratagem by which it imposes upon us an old argument in a new dress, and appeals to the agreement of two witnesses, the one with the credentials of pure reason, and the other with those of empiricism; while, in fact, it is only the former who has changed his dress and voice, for the purpose of passing himself off for an additional witness.", "That it may possess a secure foundation, it bases its conclusions upon experience, and thus appears to be completely distinct from the ontological argument, which places its confidence entirely in pure Ã  priori conceptions.", "But this experience merely aids reason in making one stepâ€to the existence of a necessary being.", "What the properties of this being are cannot be learned from experience; and therefore reason abandons it altogether, and pursues its inquiries in the sphere of pure conception, for the purpose of discovering what the properties of an absolutely necessary being ought to be, that is, what among all possible things contain the conditions (requisita) of absolute necessity.", "Reason believes that it has discovered these requisites in the conception of an ens realissimumâ€and in it alone, and hence concludes  The ens realissimum is an absolutely necessary being.", "But it is evident that reason has here presupposed that the conception of an ens realissimum is perfectly adequate to the conception of a being of absolute necessity, that is, that we may infer the existence of the latter from that of the formerâ€a proposition which formed the basis of the ontological argument, and which is now employed in the support of the cosmological argument, contrary to the wish and professions of its inventors.", "For the existence of an absolutely necessary being is given in conceptions alone.", "But if I say  â€œThe conception of the ens realissimum is a conception of this kind, and in fact the only conception which is adequate to our idea of a necessary being,â€ I am obliged to admit, that the latter may be inferred from the former.", "Thus it is properly the ontological argument which figures in the cosmological, and constitutes the whole strength of the latter; while the spurious basis of experience has been of no further use than to conduct us to the conception of absolute necessity, being utterly insufficient to demonstrate the presence of this attribute in any determinate existence or thing.", "For when we propose to ourselves an aim of this character, we must abandon the sphere of experience, and rise to that of pure conceptions, which we examine with the purpose of discovering whether any one contains the conditions of the possibility of an absolutely necessary being.", "But if the possibility of such a being is thus demonstrated, its existence is also proved; for we may then assert that, of all possible beings there is one which possesses the attribute of necessityâ€in other words, this being possesses an absolutely necessary existence.", "All illusions in an argument are more easily detected when they are presented in the formal manner employed by the schools, which we now proceed to do.", "If the proposition  â€œEvery absolutely necessary being is likewise an ens realissimum,â€ is correct (and it is this which constitutes the nervus probandi of the cosmological argument), it must, like all affirmative judgements, be capable of conversionâ€the conversio per accidens, at least.", "It follows, then, that some entia realissima are absolutely necessary beings.", "But no ens realissimum is in any respect different from another, and what is valid of some is valid of all.", "In this present case, therefore, I may employ simple conversion, and say  â€œEvery ens realissimum is a necessary being.â€ But as this proposition is determined Ã  priori by the conceptions contained in it, the mere conception of an ens realissimum must possess the additional attribute of absolute necessity.", "But this is exactly what was maintained in the ontological argument, and not recognized by the cosmological, although it formed the real ground of its disguised and illusory reasoning.", "Thus the second mode employed by speculative reason of demonstrating the existence of a Supreme Being, is not only, like the first, illusory and inadequate, but possesses the additional blemish of an ignoratio elenchiâ€professing to conduct us by a new road to the desired goal, but bringing us back, after a short circuit, to the old path which we had deserted at its call.", "I mentioned above that this cosmological argument contains a perfect nest of dialectical assumptions, which transcendental criticism does not find it difficult to expose and to dissipate.", "I shall merely enumerate these, leaving it to the reader, who must by this time be well practised in such matters, to investigate the fallacies residing therein.", "The following fallacies, for example, are discoverable in this mode of proof  1.", "The transcendental principle  â€œEverything that is contingent must have a causeâ€â€a principle without significance, except in the sensuous world.", "For the purely intellectual conception of the contingent cannot produce any synthetical proposition, like that of causality, which is itself without significance or distinguishing characteristic except in the phenomenal world.", "But in the present case it is employed to help us beyond the limits of its sphere.", "2. â€œFrom the impossibility of an infinite ascending series of causes in the world of sense a first cause is inferredâ€; a conclusion which the principles of the employment of reason do not justify even in the sphere of experience, and still less when an attempt is made to pass the limits of this sphere.", "3.", "Reason allows itself to be satisfied upon insufficient grounds, with regard to the completion of this series.", "It removes all conditions (without which, however, no conception of Necessity can take place); and, as after this it is beyond our power to form any other conceptions, it accepts this as a completion of the conception it wishes to form of the series.", "4.", "The logical possibility of a conception of the total of reality (the criterion of this possibility being the absence of contradiction) is confounded with the transcendental, which requires a principle of the practicability of such a synthesisâ€a principle which again refers us to the world of experience.", "And so on.", "The aim of the cosmological argument is to avoid the necessity of proving the existence of a necessary being priori from mere conceptionsâ€a proof which must be ontological, and of which we feel ourselves quite incapable.", "With this purpose, we reason from an actual existenceâ€an experience in general, to an absolutely necessary condition of that existence.", "It is in this case unnecessary to demonstrate its possibility.", "For after having proved that it exists, the question regarding its possibility is superfluous.", "Now, when we wish to define more strictly the nature of this necessary being, we do not look out for some being the conception of which would enable us to comprehend the necessity of its beingâ€for if we could do this, an empirical presupposition would be unnecessary; no, we try to discover merely the negative condition (conditio sine qua non), without which a being would not be absolutely necessary.", "Now this would be perfectly admissible in every sort of reasoning, from a consequence to its principle; but in the present case it unfortunately happens that the condition of absolute necessity can be discovered in but a single being, the conception of which must consequently contain all that is requisite for demonstrating the presence of absolute necessity, and thus entitle me to infer this absolute necessity Ã  priori.", "That is, it must be possible to reason conversely, and say  The thing, to which the conception of the highest reality belongs, is absolutely necessary.", "But if I cannot reason thusâ€and I cannot, unless I believe in the sufficiency of the ontological argumentâ€I find insurmountable obstacles in my new path, and am really no farther than the point from which I set out.", "The conception of a Supreme Being satisfies all questions Ã  priori regarding the internal determinations of a thing, and is for this reason an ideal without equal or parallel, the general conception of it indicating it as at the same time an ens individuum among all possible things.", "But the conception does not satisfy the question regarding its existenceâ€which was the purpose of all our inquiries; and, although the existence of a necessary being were admitted, we should find it impossible to answer the question  What of all things in the world must be regarded as such?", "It is certainly allowable to admit the existence of an all sufficient beingâ€a cause of all possible effectsâ€for the purpose of enabling reason to introduce unity into its mode and grounds of explanation with regard to phenomena.", "But to assert that such a being necessarily exists, is no longer the modest enunciation of an admissible hypothesis, but the boldest declaration of an apodeictic certainty; for the cognition of that which is absolutely necessary must itself possess that character.", "The aim of the transcendental ideal formed by the mind is either to discover a conception which shall harmonize with the idea of absolute necessity, or a conception which shall contain that idea.", "If the one is possible, so is the other; for reason recognizes that alone as absolutely necessary which is necessary from its conception.", "But both attempts are equally beyond our powerâ€we find it impossible to satisfy the understanding upon this point, and as impossible to induce it to remain at rest in relation to this incapacity.", "Unconditioned necessity, which, as the ultimate support and stay of all existing things, is an indispensable requirement of the mind, is an abyss on the verge of which human reason trembles in dismay.", "Even the idea of eternity, terrible and sublime as it is, as depicted by Haller, does not produce upon the mental vision such a feeling of awe and terror; for, although it measures the duration of things, it does not support them.", "We cannot bear, nor can we rid ourselves of the thought that a being, which we regard as the greatest of all possible existences, should say to himself  I am from eternity to eternity; beside me there is nothing, except that which exists by my will; whence then am I?", "Here all sinks away from under us; and the greatest, as the smallest, perfection, hovers without stay or footing in presence of the speculative reason, which finds it as easy to part with the one as with the other.", "Many physical powers, which evidence their existence by their effects, are perfectly inscrutable in their nature; they elude all our powers of observation.", "The transcendental object which forms the basis of phenomena, and, in connection with it, the reason why our sensibility possesses this rather than that particular kind of conditions, are and must ever remain hidden from our mental vision; the fact is there, the reason of the fact we cannot see.", "But an ideal of pure reason cannot be termed mysterious or inscrutable, because the only credential of its reality is the need of it felt by reason, for the purpose of giving completeness to the world of synthetical unity.", "An ideal is not even given as a cogitable object, and therefore cannot be inscrutable; on the contrary, it must, as a mere idea, be based on the constitution of reason itself, and on this account must be capable of explanation and solution.", "For the very essence of reason consists in its ability to give an account, of all our conceptions, opinions, and assertionsâ€upon objective, or, when they happen to be illusory and fallacious, upon subjective grounds.", "Detection and Explanation of the Dialectical Illusion in all Transcendental Arguments for the Existence of a Necessary Being.", "Both of the above arguments are transcendental; in other words, they do not proceed upon empirical principles.", "For, although the cosmological argument professed to lay a basis of experience for its edifice of reasoning, it did not ground its procedure upon the peculiar constitution of experience, but upon pure principles of reasonâ€in relation to an existence given by empirical consciousness; utterly abandoning its guidance, however, for the purpose of supporting its assertions entirely upon pure conceptions.", "Now what is the cause, in these transcendental arguments, of the dialectical, but natural, illusion, which connects the conceptions of necessity and supreme reality, and hypostatizes that which cannot be anything but an idea?", "What is the cause of this unavoidable step on the part of reason, of admitting that some one among all existing things must be necessary, while it falls back from the assertion of the existence of such a being as from an abyss?", "And how does reason proceed to explain this anomaly to itself, and from the wavering condition of a timid and reluctant approbationâ€always again withdrawnâ€arrive at a calm and settled insight into its cause?", "It is something very remarkable that, on the supposition that something exists, I cannot avoid the inference that something exists necessarily.", "Upon this perfectly naturalâ€but not on that account reliableâ€inference does the cosmological argument rest.", "But, let me form any conception whatever of a thing, I find that I cannot cogitate the existence of the thing as absolutely necessary, and that nothing prevents meâ€be the thing or being what it mayâ€from cogitating its non existence.", "I may thus be obliged to admit that all existing things have a necessary basis, while I cannot cogitate any single or individual thing as necessary.", "In other words, I can never complete the regress through the conditions of existence, without admitting the existence of a necessary being; but, on the other hand, I cannot make a commencement from this being.", "If I must cogitate something as existing necessarily as the basis of existing things, and yet am not permitted to cogitate any individual thing as in itself necessary, the inevitable inference is that necessity and contingency are not properties of things themselvesâ€otherwise an internal contradiction would result; that consequently neither of these principles are objective, but merely subjective principles of reasonâ€the one requiring us to seek for a necessary ground for everything that exists, that is, to be satisfied with no other explanation than that which is complete Ã  priori, the other forbidding us ever to hope for the attainment of this completeness, that is, to regard no member of the empirical world as unconditioned.", "In this mode of viewing them, both principles, in their purely heuristic and regulative character, and as concerning merely the formal interest of reason, are quite consistent with each other.", "The one says  â€œYou must philosophize upon nature,â€ as if there existed a necessary primal basis of all existing things, solely for the purpose of introducing systematic unity into your knowledge, by pursuing an idea of this characterâ€a foundation which is arbitrarily admitted to be ultimate; while the other warns you to consider no individual determination, concerning the existence of things, as such an ultimate foundation, that is, as absolutely necessary, but to keep the way always open for further progress in the deduction, and to treat every determination as determined by some other.", "But if all that we perceive must be regarded as conditionally necessary, it is impossible that anything which is empirically given should be absolutely necessary.", "It follows from this that you must accept the absolutely necessary as out of and beyond the world, inasmuch as it is useful only as a principle of the highest possible unity in experience, and you cannot discover any such necessary existence in the would, the second rule requiring you to regard all empirical causes of unity as themselves deduced.", "The philosophers of antiquity regarded all the forms of nature as contingent; while matter was considered by them, in accordance with the judgement of the common reason of mankind, as primal and necessary.", "But if they had regarded matter, not relativelyâ€as the substratum of phenomena, but absolutely and in itselfâ€as an independent existence, this idea of absolute necessity would have immediately disappeared.", "For there is nothing absolutely connecting reason with such an existence; on the contrary, it can annihilate it in thought, always and without self contradiction.", "But in thought alone lay the idea of absolute necessity.", "A regulative principle must, therefore, have been at the foundation of this opinion.", "In fact, extension and impenetrabilityâ€which together constitute our conception of matterâ€form the supreme empirical principle of the unity of phenomena, and this principle, in so far as it is empirically unconditioned, possesses the property of a regulative principle.", "But, as every determination of matter which constitutes what is real in itâ€and consequently impenetrabilityâ€is an effect, which must have a cause, and is for this reason always derived, the notion of matter cannot harmonize with the idea of a necessary being, in its character of the principle of all derived unity.", "For every one of its real properties, being derived, must be only conditionally necessary, and can therefore be annihilated in thought; and thus the whole existence of matter can be so annihilated or suppressed.", "If this were not the case, we should have found in the world of phenomena the highest ground or condition of unityâ€which is impossible, according to the second regulative principle.", "It follows that matter, and, in general, all that forms part of the world of sense, cannot be a necessary primal being, nor even a principle of empirical unity, but that this being or principle must have its place assigned without the world.", "And, in this way, we can proceed in perfect confidence to deduce the phenomena of the world and their existence from other phenomena, just as if there existed no necessary being; and we can at the same time, strive without ceasing towards the attainment of completeness for our deduction, just as if such a beingâ€the supreme condition of all existencesâ€were presupposed by the mind.", "These remarks will have made it evident to the reader that the ideal of the Supreme Being, far from being an enouncement of the existence of a being in itself necessary, is nothing more than a regulative principle of reason, requiring us to regard all connection existing between phenomena as if it had its origin from an all sufficient necessary cause, and basing upon this the rule of a systematic and necessary unity in the explanation of phenomena.", "We cannot, at the same time, avoid regarding, by a transcendental subreptio, this formal principle as constitutive, and hypostatizing this unity.", "Precisely similar is the case with our notion of space.", "Space is the primal condition of all forms, which are properly just so many different limitations of it; and thus, although it is merely a principle of sensibility, we cannot help regarding it as an absolutely necessary and self subsistent thingâ€as an object given Ã  priori in itself.", "In the same way, it is quite natural that, as the systematic unity of nature cannot be established as a principle for the empirical employment of reason, unless it is based upon the idea of an ens realissimum, as the supreme cause, we should regard this idea as a real object, and this object, in its character of supreme condition, as absolutely necessary, and that in this way a regulative should be transformed into a constitutive principle.", "This interchange becomes evident when I regard this supreme being, which, relatively to the world, was absolutely (unconditionally) necessary, as a thing per se.", "In this case, I find it impossible to represent this necessity in or by any conception, and it exists merely in my own mind, as the formal condition of thought, but not as a material and hypostatic condition of existence.", "Section VI.", "Of the Impossibility of a Physico Theological Proof  If, then, neither a pure conception nor the general experience of an existing being can provide a sufficient basis for the proof of the existence of the Deity, we can make the attempt by the only other modeâ€that of grounding our argument upon a determinate experience of the phenomena of the present world, their constitution and disposition, and discover whether we can thus attain to a sound conviction of the existence of a Supreme Being.", "This argument we shall term the physico theological argument.", "If it is shown to be insufficient, speculative reason cannot present us with any satisfactory proof of the existence of a being corresponding to our transcendental idea.", "It is evident from the remarks that have been made in the preceding sections, that an answer to this question will be far from being difficult or unconvincing.", "For how can any experience be adequate with an idea?", "The very essence of an idea consists in the fact that no experience can ever be discovered congruent or adequate with it.", "The transcendental idea of a necessary and all sufficient being is so immeasurably great, so high above all that is empirical, which is always conditioned, that we hope in vain to find materials in the sphere of experience sufficiently ample for our conception, and in vain seek the unconditioned among things that are conditioned, while examples, nay, even guidance is denied us by the laws of empirical synthesis.", "If the Supreme Being forms a link in the chain of empirical conditions, it must be a member of the empirical series, and, like the lower members which it precedes, have its origin in some higher member of the series.", "If, on the other hand, we disengage it from the chain, and cogitate it as an intelligible being, apart from the series of natural causesâ€how shall reason bridge the abyss that separates the latter from the former?", "All laws respecting the regress from effects to causes, all synthetical additions to our knowledge relate solely to possible experience and the objects of the sensuous world, and, apart from them, are without significance.", "The world around us opens before our view so magnificent a spectacle of order, variety, beauty, and conformity to ends, that whether we pursue our observations into the infinity of space in the one direction, or into its illimitable divisions in the other, whether we regard the world in its greatest or its least manifestationsâ€even after we have attained to the highest summit of knowledge which our weak minds can reach, we find that language in the presence of wonders so inconceivable has lost its force, and number its power to reckon, nay, even thought fails to conceive adequately, and our conception of the whole dissolves into an astonishment without power of expressionâ€all the more eloquent that it is dumb.", "Everywhere around us we observe a chain of causes and effects, of means and ends, of death and birth; and, as nothing has entered of itself into the condition in which we find it, we are constantly referred to some other thing, which itself suggests the same inquiry regarding its cause, and thus the universe must sink into the abyss of nothingness, unless we admit that, besides this infinite chain of contingencies, there exists something that is primal and self subsistentâ€something which, as the cause of this phenomenal world, secures its continuance and preservation.", "This highest causeâ€what magnitude shall we attribute to it?", "Of the content of the world we are ignorant; still less can we estimate its magnitude by comparison with the sphere of the possible.", "But this supreme cause being a necessity of the human mind, what is there to prevent us from attributing to it such a degree of perfection as to place it above the sphere of all that is possible?", "This we can easily do, although only by the aid of the faint outline of an abstract conception, by representing this being to ourselves as containing in itself, as an individual substance, all possible perfectionâ€a conception which satisfies that requirement of reason which demands parsimony in principles, which is free from self contradiction, which even contributes to the extension of the employment of reason in experience, by means of the guidance afforded by this idea to order and system, and which in no respect conflicts with any law of experience.", "This argument always deserves to be mentioned with respect.", "It is the oldest, the clearest, and that most in conformity with the common reason of humanity.", "It animates the study of nature, as it itself derives its existence and draws ever new strength from that source.", "It introduces aims and ends into a sphere in which our observation could not of itself have discovered them, and extends our knowledge of nature, by directing our attention to a unity, the principle of which lies beyond nature.", "This knowledge of nature again reacts upon this ideaâ€its cause; and thus our belief in a divine author of the universe rises to the power of an irresistible conviction.", "For these reasons it would be utterly hopeless to attempt to rob this argument of the authority it has always enjoyed.", "The mind, unceasingly elevated by these considerations, which, although empirical, are so remarkably powerful, and continually adding to their force, will not suffer itself to be depressed by the doubts suggested by subtle speculation; it tears itself out of this state of uncertainty, the moment it casts a look upon the wondrous forms of nature and the majesty of the universe, and rises from height to height, from condition to condition, till it has elevated itself to the supreme and unconditioned author of all.", "But although we have nothing to object to the reasonableness and utility of this procedure, but have rather to commend and encourage it, we cannot approve of the claims which this argument advances to demonstrative certainty and to a reception upon its own merits, apart from favour or support by other arguments.", "Nor can it injure the cause of morality to endeavour to lower the tone of the arrogant sophist, and to teach him that modesty and moderation which are the properties of a belief that brings calm and content into the mind, without prescribing to it an unworthy subjection.", "I maintain, then, that the physico theological argument is insufficient of itself to prove the existence of a Supreme Being, that it must entrust this to the ontological argumentâ€to which it serves merely as an introduction, and that, consequently, this argument contains the only possible ground of proof (possessed by speculative reason) for the existence of this being.", "The chief momenta in the physico theological argument are as follow  1.", "We observe in the world manifest signs of an arrangement full of purpose, executed with great wisdom, and argument in whole of a content indescribably various, and of an extent without limits.", "2.", "This arrangement of means and ends is entirely foreign to the things existing in the worldâ€it belongs to them merely as a contingent attribute; in other words, the nature of different things could not of itself, whatever means were employed, harmoniously tend towards certain purposes, were they not chosen and directed for these purposes by a rational and disposing principle, in accordance with certain fundamental ideas.", "3.", "There exists, therefore, a sublime and wise cause (or several), which is not merely a blind, all powerful nature, producing the beings and events which fill the world in unconscious fecundity, but a free and intelligent cause of the world.", "4.", "The unity of this cause may be inferred from the unity of the reciprocal relation existing between the parts of the world, as portions of an artistic edificeâ€an inference which all our observation favours, and all principles of analogy support.", "In the above argument, it is inferred from the analogy of certain products of nature with those of human art, when it compels Nature to bend herself to its purposes, as in the case of a house, a ship, or a watch, that the same kind of causalityâ€namely, understanding and willâ€resides in nature.", "It is also declared that the internal possibility of this freely acting nature (which is the source of all art, and perhaps also of human reason) is derivable from another and superhuman artâ€a conclusion which would perhaps be found incapable of standing the test of subtle transcendental criticism.", "But to neither of these opinions shall we at present object.", "We shall only remark that it must be confessed that, if we are to discuss the subject of cause at all, we cannot proceed more securely than with the guidance of the analogy subsisting between nature and such products of designâ€these being the only products whose causes and modes of organization are completely known to us.", "Reason would be unable to satisfy her own requirements, if she passed from a causality which she does know, to obscure and indemonstrable principles of explanation which she does not know.", "According to the physico theological argument, the connection and harmony existing in the world evidence the contingency of the form merely, but not of the matter, that is, of the substance of the world.", "To establish the truth of the latter opinion, it would be necessary to prove that all things would be in themselves incapable of this harmony and order, unless they were, even as regards their substance, the product of a supreme wisdom.", "But this would require very different grounds of proof from those presented by the analogy with human art.", "This proof can at most, therefore, demonstrate the existence of an architect of the world, whose efforts are limited by the capabilities of the material with which he works, but not of a creator of the world, to whom all things are subject.", "Thus this argument is utterly insufficient for the task before usâ€a demonstration of the existence of an all sufficient being.", "If we wish to prove the contingency of matter, we must have recourse to a transcendental argument, which the physico theological was constructed expressly to avoid.", "We infer, from the order and design visible in the universe, as a disposition of a thoroughly contingent character, the existence of a cause proportionate thereto.", "The conception of this cause must contain certain determinate qualities, and it must therefore be regarded as the conception of a being which possesses all power, wisdom, and so on, in one word, all perfectionâ€the conception, that is, of an all sufficient being.", "For the predicates of very great, astonishing, or immeasurable power and excellence, give us no determinate conception of the thing, nor do they inform us what the thing may be in itself.", "They merely indicate the relation existing between the magnitude of the object and the observer, who compares it with himself and with his own power of comprehension, and are mere expressions of praise and reverence, by which the object is either magnified, or the observing subject depreciated in relation to the object.", "Where we have to do with the magnitude (of the perfection) of a thing, we can discover no determinate conception, except that which comprehends all possible perfection or completeness, and it is only the total (omnitudo) of reality which is completely determined in and through its conception alone.", "Now it cannot be expected that any one will be bold enough to declare that he has a perfect insight into the relation which the magnitude of the world he contemplates bears (in its extent as well as in its content) to omnipotence, into that of the order and design in the world to the highest wisdom, and that of the unity of the world to the absolute unity of a Supreme Being.", "Physico theology is therefore incapable of presenting a determinate conception of a supreme cause of the world, and is therefore insufficient as a principle of theologyâ€a theology which is itself to be the basis of religion.", "The attainment of absolute totality is completely impossible on the path of empiricism.", "And yet this is the path pursued in the physico theological argument.", "What means shall we employ to bridge the abyss?", "After elevating ourselves to admiration of the magnitude of the power, wisdom, and other attributes of the author of the world, and finding we can advance no further, we leave the argument on empirical grounds, and proceed to infer the contingency of the world from the order and conformity to aims that are observable in it.", "From this contingency we infer, by the help of transcendental conceptions alone, the existence of something absolutely necessary; and, still advancing, proceed from the conception of the absolute necessity of the first cause to the completely determined or determining conception thereofâ€the conception of an all embracing reality.", "Thus the physico theological, failing in its undertaking, recurs in its embarrassment to the cosmological argument; and, as this is merely the ontological argument in disguise, it executes its design solely by the aid of pure reason, although it at first professed to have no connection with this faculty and to base its entire procedure upon experience alone.", "The physico theologians have therefore no reason to regard with such contempt the transcendental mode of argument, and to look down upon it, with the conceit of clear sighted observers of nature, as the brain cobweb of obscure speculatists.", "For, if they reflect upon and examine their own arguments, they will find that, after following for some time the path of nature and experience, and discovering themselves no nearer their object, they suddenly leave this path and pass into the region of pure possibility, where they hope to reach upon the wings of ideas what had eluded all their empirical investigations.", "Gaining, as they think, a firm footing after this immense leap, they extend their determinate conceptionâ€into the possession of which they have come, they know not howâ€over the whole sphere of creation, and explain their ideal, which is entirely a product of pure reason, by illustrations drawn from experienceâ€though in a degree miserably unworthy of the grandeur of the object, while they refuse to acknowledge that they have arrived at this cognition or hypothesis by a very different road from that of experience.", "Thus the physico theological is based upon the cosmological, and this upon the ontological proof of the existence of a Supreme Being; and as besides these three there is no other path open to speculative reason, the ontological proof, on the ground of pure conceptions of reason, is the only possible one, if any proof of a proposition so far transcending the empirical exercise of the understanding is possible at all.", "Section VII.", "Critique of all Theology based upon Speculative Principles of Reason  If by the term theology I understand the cognition of a primal being, that cognition is based either upon reason alone (theologia rationalis) or upon revelation (theologia revelata).", "The former cogitates its object either by means of pure transcendental conceptions, as an ens originarium, realissimum, ens entium, and is termed transcendental theology; or, by means of a conception derived from the nature of our own mind, as a supreme intelligence, and must then be entitled natural theology.", "The person who believes in a transcendental theology alone, is termed a deist; he who acknowledges the possibility of a natural theology also, a theist.", "The former admits that we can cognize by pure reason alone the existence of a Supreme Being, but at the same time maintains that our conception of this being is purely transcendental, and that all we can say of it is that it possesses all reality, without being able to define it more closely.", "The second asserts that reason is capable of presenting us, from the analogy with nature, with a more definite conception of this being, and that its operations, as the cause of all things, are the results of intelligence and free will.", "The former regards the Supreme Being as the cause of the worldâ€whether by the necessity of his nature, or as a free agent, is left undetermined; the latter considers this being as the author of the world.", "Transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a Supreme Being from a general experience, without any closer reference to the world to which this experience belongs, and in this case it is called cosmotheology; or it endeavours to cognize the existence of such a being, through mere conceptions, without the aid of experience, and is then termed ontotheology.", "Natural theology infers the attributes and the existence of an author of the world, from the constitution of, the order and unity observable in, the world, in which two modes of causality must be admitted to existâ€those of nature and freedom.", "Thus it rises from this world to a supreme intelligence, either as the principle of all natural, or of all moral order and perfection.", "In the former case it is termed physico theology, in the latter, ethical or moral theology.", "[69]   [69] Not theological ethics; for this science contains ethical laws,  which presuppose the existence of a Supreme Governor of the world;  while moral theology, on the contrary, is the expression of a  conviction of the existence of a Supreme Being, founded upon ethical  laws.", "As we are wont to understand by the term God not merely an eternal nature, the operations of which are insensate and blind, but a Supreme Being, who is the free and intelligent author of all things, and as it is this latter view alone that can be of interest to humanity, we might, in strict rigour, deny to the deist any belief in God at all, and regard him merely as a maintainer of the existence of a primal being or thingâ€the supreme cause of all other things.", "But, as no one ought to be blamed, merely because he does not feel himself justified in maintaining a certain opinion, as if he altogether denied its truth and asserted the opposite, it is more correctâ€as it is less harshâ€to say, the deist believes in a God, the theist in a living God (summa intelligentia).", "We shall now proceed to investigate the sources of all these attempts of reason to establish the existence of a Supreme Being.", "It may be sufficient in this place to define theoretical knowledge or cognition as knowledge of that which is, and practical knowledge as knowledge of that which ought to be.", "In this view, the theoretical employment of reason is that by which I cognize Ã  priori (as necessary) that something is, while the practical is that by which I cognize Ã  priori what ought to happen.", "Now, if it is an indubitably certain, though at the same time an entirely conditioned truth, that something is, or ought to happen, either a certain determinate condition of this truth is absolutely necessary, or such a condition may be arbitrarily presupposed.", "In the former case the condition is postulated (per thesin), in the latter supposed (per hypothesin).", "There are certain practical lawsâ€those of moralityâ€which are absolutely necessary.", "Now, if these laws necessarily presuppose the existence of some being, as the condition of the possibility of their obligatory power, this being must be postulated, because the conditioned, from which we reason to this determinate condition, is itself cognized Ã  priori as absolutely necessary.", "We shall at some future time show that the moral laws not merely presuppose the existence of a Supreme Being, but also, as themselves absolutely necessary in a different relation, demand or postulate itâ€although only from a practical point of view.", "The discussion of this argument we postpone for the present.", "When the question relates merely to that which is, not to that which ought to be, the conditioned which is presented in experience is always cogitated as contingent.", "For this reason its condition cannot be regarded as absolutely necessary, but merely as relatively necessary, or rather as needful; the condition is in itself and Ã  priori a mere arbitrary presupposition in aid of the cognition, by reason, of the conditioned.", "If, then, we are to possess a theoretical cognition of the absolute necessity of a thing, we cannot attain to this cognition otherwise than Ã  priori by means of conceptions; while it is impossible in this way to cognize the existence of a cause which bears any relation to an existence given in experience.", "Theoretical cognition is speculative when it relates to an object or certain conceptions of an object which is not given and cannot be discovered by means of experience.", "It is opposed to the cognition of nature, which concerns only those objects or predicates which can be presented in a possible experience.", "The principle that everything which happens (the empirically contingent) must have a cause, is a principle of the cognition of nature, but not of speculative cognition.", "For, if we change it into an abstract principle, and deprive it of its reference to experience and the empirical, we shall find that it cannot with justice be regarded any longer as a synthetical proposition, and that it is impossible to discover any mode of transition from that which exists to something entirely differentâ€termed cause.", "Nay, more, the conception of a cause likewise that of the contingentâ€loses, in this speculative mode of employing it, all significance, for its objective reality and meaning are comprehensible from experience alone.", "When from the existence of the universe and the things in it the existence of a cause of the universe is inferred, reason is proceeding not in the natural, but in the speculative method.", "For the principle of the former enounces, not that things themselves or substances, but only that which happens or their statesâ€as empirically contingent, have a cause  the assertion that the existence of substance itself is contingent is not justified by experience, it is the assertion of a reason employing its principles in a speculative manner.", "If, again, I infer from the form of the universe, from the way in which all things are connected and act and react upon each other, the existence of a cause entirely distinct from the universeâ€this would again be a judgement of purely speculative reason; because the object in this caseâ€the causeâ€can never be an object of possible experience.", "In both these cases the principle of causality, which is valid only in the field of experienceâ€useless and even meaningless beyond this region, would be diverted from its proper destination.", "Now I maintain that all attempts of reason to establish a theology by the aid of speculation alone are fruitless, that the principles of reason as applied to nature do not conduct us to any theological truths, and, consequently, that a rational theology can have no existence, unless it is founded upon the laws of morality.", "For all synthetical principles of the understanding are valid only as immanent in experience; while the cognition of a Supreme Being necessitates their being employed transcendentally, and of this the understanding is quite incapable.", "If the empirical law of causality is to conduct us to a Supreme Being, this being must belong to the chain of empirical objectsâ€in which case it would be, like all phenomena, itself conditioned.", "If the possibility of passing the limits of experience be admitted, by means of the dynamical law of the relation of an effect to its cause, what kind of conception shall we obtain by this procedure?", "Certainly not the conception of a Supreme Being, because experience never presents us with the greatest of all possible effects, and it is only an effect of this character that could witness to the existence of a corresponding cause.", "If, for the purpose of fully satisfying the requirements of Reason, we recognize her right to assert the existence of a perfect and absolutely necessary being, this can be admitted only from favour, and cannot be regarded as the result or irresistible demonstration.", "The physico theological proof may add weight to othersâ€if other proofs there areâ€by connecting speculation with experience; but in itself it rather prepares the mind for theological cognition, and gives it a right and natural direction, than establishes a sure foundation for theology.", "It is now perfectly evident that transcendental questions admit only of transcendental answersâ€those presented Ã  priori by pure conceptions without the least empirical admixture.", "But the question in the present case is evidently syntheticalâ€it aims at the extension of our cognition beyond the bounds of experienceâ€it requires an assurance respecting the existence of a being corresponding with the idea in our minds, to which no experience can ever be adequate.", "Now it has been abundantly proved that all Ã  priori synthetical cognition is possible only as the expression of the formal conditions of a possible experience; and that the validity of all principles depends upon their immanence in the field of experience, that is, their relation to objects of empirical cognition or phenomena.", "Thus all transcendental procedure in reference to speculative theology is without result.", "If any one prefers doubting the conclusiveness of the proofs of our analytic to losing the persuasion of the validity of these old and time honoured arguments, he at least cannot decline answering the questionâ€how he can pass the limits of all possible experience by the help of mere ideas.", "If he talks of new arguments, or of improvements upon old arguments, I request him to spare me.", "There is certainly no great choice in this sphere of discussion, as all speculative arguments must at last look for support to the ontological, and I have, therefore, very little to fear from the argumentative fecundity of the dogmatical defenders of a non sensuous reason.", "Without looking upon myself as a remarkably combative person, I shall not decline the challenge to detect the fallacy and destroy the pretensions of every attempt of speculative theology.", "And yet the hope of better fortune never deserts those who are accustomed to the dogmatical mode of procedure.", "I shall, therefore, restrict myself to the simple and equitable demand that such reasoners will demonstrate, from the nature of the human mind as well as from that of the other sources of knowledge, how we are to proceed to extend our cognition completely Ã  priori, and to carry it to that point where experience abandons us, and no means exist of guaranteeing the objective reality of our conceptions.", "In whatever way the understanding may have attained to a conception, the existence of the object of the conception cannot be discovered in it by analysis, because the cognition of the existence of the object depends upon the objectâ€™s being posited and given in itself apart from the conception.", "But it is utterly impossible to go beyond our conception, without the aid of experienceâ€which presents to the mind nothing but phenomena, or to attain by the help of mere conceptions to a conviction of the existence of new kinds of objects or supernatural beings.", "But although pure speculative reason is far from sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a Supreme Being, it is of the highest utility in correcting our conception of this beingâ€on the supposition that we can attain to the cognition of it by some other meansâ€in making it consistent with itself and with all other conceptions of intelligible objects, clearing it from all that is incompatible with the conception of an ens summun, and eliminating from it all limitations or admixtures of empirical elements.", "Transcendental theology is still therefore, notwithstanding its objective insufficiency, of importance in a negative respect; it is useful as a test of the procedure of reason when engaged with pure ideas, no other than a transcendental standard being in this case admissible.", "For if, from a practical point of view, the hypothesis of a Supreme and All sufficient Being is to maintain its validity without opposition, it must be of the highest importance to define this conception in a correct and rigorous mannerâ€as the transcendental conception of a necessary being, to eliminate all phenomenal elements (anthropomorphism in its most extended signification), and at the same time to overflow all contradictory assertionsâ€be they atheistic, deistic, or anthropomorphic.", "This is of course very easy; as the same arguments which demonstrated the inability of human reason to affirm the existence of a Supreme Being must be alike sufficient to prove the invalidity of its denial.", "For it is impossible to gain from the pure speculation of reason demonstration that there exists no Supreme Being, as the ground of all that exists, or that this being possesses none of those properties which we regard as analogical with the dynamical qualities of a thinking being, or that, as the anthropomorphists would have us believe, it is subject to all the limitations which sensibility imposes upon those intelligences which exist in the world of experience.", "A Supreme Being is, therefore, for the speculative reason, a mere ideal, though a faultless oneâ€a conception which perfects and crowns the system of human cognition, but the objective reality of which can neither be proved nor disproved by pure reason.", "If this defect is ever supplied by a moral theology, the problematic transcendental theology which has preceded, will have been at least serviceable as demonstrating the mental necessity existing for the conception, by the complete determination of it which it has furnished, and the ceaseless testing of the conclusions of a reason often deceived by sense, and not always in harmony with its own ideas.", "The attributes of necessity, infinitude, unity, existence apart from the world (and not as a world soul), eternity (free from conditions of time), omnipresence (free from conditions of space), omnipotence, and others, are pure transcendental predicates; and thus the accurate conception of a Supreme Being, which every theology requires, is furnished by transcendental theology alone.", "APPENDIX.", "Of the Regulative Employment of the Ideas of Pure Reason  The result of all the dialectical attempts of pure reason not only confirms the truth of what we have already proved in our Transcendental Analytic, namely, that all inferences which would lead us beyond the limits of experience are fallacious and groundless, but it at the same time teaches us this important lesson, that human reason has a natural inclination to overstep these limits, and that transcendental ideas are as much the natural property of the reason as categories are of the understanding.", "There exists this difference, however, that while the categories never mislead us, outward objects being always in perfect harmony therewith, ideas are the parents of irresistible illusions, the severest and most subtle criticism being required to save us from the fallacies which they induce.", "Whatever is grounded in the nature of our powers will be found to be in harmony with the final purpose and proper employment of these powers, when once we have discovered their true direction and aim.", "We are entitled to suppose, therefore, that there exists a mode of employing transcendental ideas which is proper and immanent; although, when we mistake their meaning, and regard them as conceptions of actual things, their mode of application is transcendent and delusive.", "For it is not the idea itself, but only the employment of the idea in relation to possible experience, that is transcendent or immanent.", "An idea is employed transcendently, when it is applied to an object falsely believed to be adequate with and to correspond to it; imminently, when it is applied solely to the employment of the understanding in the sphere of experience.", "Thus all errors of subreptioâ€of misapplication, are to be ascribed to defects of judgement, and not to understanding or reason.", "Reason never has an immediate relation to an object; it relates immediately to the understanding alone.", "It is only through the understanding that it can be employed in the field of experience.", "It does not form conceptions of objects, it merely arranges them and gives to them that unity which they are capable of possessing when the sphere of their application has been extended as widely as possible.", "Reason avails itself of the conception of the understanding for the sole purpose of producing totality in the different series.", "This totality the understanding does not concern itself with; its only occupation is the connection of experiences, by which series of conditions in accordance with conceptions are established.", "The object of reason is, therefore, the understanding and its proper destination.", "As the latter brings unity into the diversity of objects by means of its conceptions, so the former brings unity into the diversity of conceptions by means of ideas; as it sets the final aim of a collective unity to the operations of the understanding, which without this occupies itself with a distributive unity alone.", "I accordingly maintain that transcendental ideas can never be employed as constitutive ideas, that they cannot be conceptions of objects, and that, when thus considered, they assume a fallacious and dialectical character.", "But, on the other hand, they are capable of an admirable and indispensably necessary application to objectsâ€as regulative ideas, directing the understanding to a certain aim, the guiding lines towards which all its laws follow, and in which they all meet in one point.", "This pointâ€though a mere idea (focus imaginarius), that is, not a point from which the conceptions of the understanding do really proceed, for it lies beyond the sphere of possible experienceâ€serves, notwithstanding, to give to these conceptions the greatest possible unity combined with the greatest possible extension.", "Hence arises the natural illusion which induces us to believe that these lines proceed from an object which lies out of the sphere of empirical cognition, just as objects reflected in a mirror appear to be behind it.", "But this illusionâ€which we may hinder from imposing upon usâ€is necessary and unavoidable, if we desire to see, not only those objects which lie before us, but those which are at a great distance behind us; that is to say, when, in the present case, we direct the aims of the understanding, beyond every given experience, towards an extension as great as can possibly be attained.", "If we review our cognitions in their entire extent, we shall find that the peculiar business of reason is to arrange them into a system, that is to say, to give them connection according to a principle.", "This unity presupposes an ideaâ€the idea of the form of a whole (of cognition), preceding the determinate cognition of the parts, and containing the conditions which determine Ã  priori to every part its place and relation to the other parts of the whole system.", "This idea, accordingly, demands complete unity in the cognition of the understandingâ€not the unity of a contingent aggregate, but that of a system connected according to necessary laws.", "It cannot be affirmed with propriety that this idea is a conception of an object; it is merely a conception of the complete unity of the conceptions of objects, in so far as this unity is available to the understanding as a rule.", "Such conceptions of reason are not derived from nature; on the contrary, we employ them for the interrogation and investigation of nature, and regard our cognition as defective so long as it is not adequate to them.", "We admit that such a thing as pure earth, pure water, or pure air, is not to be discovered.", "And yet we require these conceptions (which have their origin in the reason, so far as regards their absolute purity and completeness) for the purpose of determining the share which each of these natural causes has in every phenomenon.", "Thus the different kinds of matter are all referred to earths, as mere weight; to salts and inflammable bodies, as pure force; and finally, to water and air, as the vehicula of the former, or the machines employed by them in their operationsâ€for the purpose of explaining the chemical action and reaction of bodies in accordance with the idea of a mechanism.", "For, although not actually so expressed, the influence of such ideas of reason is very observable in the procedure of natural philosophers.", "If reason is the faculty of deducing the particular from the general, and if the general be certain in se and given, it is only necessary that the judgement should subsume the particular under the general, the particular being thus necessarily determined.", "I shall term this the demonstrative or apodeictic employment of reason.", "If, however, the general is admitted as problematical only, and is a mere idea, the particular case is certain, but the universality of the rule which applies to this particular case remains a problem.", "Several particular cases, the certainty of which is beyond doubt, are then taken and examined, for the purpose of discovering whether the rule is applicable to them; and if it appears that all the particular cases which can be collected follow from the rule, its universality is inferred, and at the same time, all the causes which have not, or cannot be presented to our observation, are concluded to be of the same character with those which we have observed.", "This I shall term the hypothetical employment of the reason.", "The hypothetical exercise of reason by the aid of ideas employed as problematical conceptions is properly not constitutive.", "That is to say, if we consider the subject strictly, the truth of the rule, which has been employed as an hypothesis, does not follow from the use that is made of it by reason.", "For how can we know all the possible cases that may arise?", "some of which may, however, prove exceptions to the universality of the rule.", "This employment of reason is merely regulative, and its sole aim is the introduction of unity into the aggregate of our particular cognitions, and thereby the approximating of the rule to universality.", "The object of the hypothetical employment of reason is therefore the systematic unity of cognitions; and this unity is the criterion of the truth of a rule.", "On the other hand, this systematic unityâ€as a mere ideaâ€is in fact merely a unity projected, not to be regarded as given, but only in the light of a problemâ€a problem which serves, however, as a principle for the various and particular exercise of the understanding in experience, directs it with regard to those cases which are not presented to our observation, and introduces harmony and consistency into all its operations.", "All that we can be certain of from the above considerations is that this systematic unity is a logical principle, whose aim is to assist the understanding, where it cannot of itself attain to rules, by means of ideas, to bring all these various rules under one principle, and thus to ensure the most complete consistency and connection that can be attained.", "But the assertion that objects and the understanding by which they are cognized are so constituted as to be determined to systematic unity, that this may be postulated Ã  priori, without any reference to the interest of reason, and that we are justified in declaring all possible cognitionsâ€empirical and othersâ€to possess systematic unity, and to be subject to general principles from which, notwithstanding their various character, they are all derivable such an assertion can be founded only upon a transcendental principle of reason, which would render this systematic unity not subjectively and logicallyâ€in its character of a method, but objectively necessary.", "We shall illustrate this by an example.", "The conceptions of the understanding make us acquainted, among many other kinds of unity, with that of the causality of a substance, which is termed power.", "The different phenomenal manifestations of the same substance appear at first view to be so very dissimilar that we are inclined to assume the existence of just as many different powers as there are different effectsâ€as, in the case of the human mind, we have feeling, consciousness, imagination, memory, wit, analysis, pleasure, desire and so on.", "Now we are required by a logical maxim to reduce these differences to as small a number as possible, by comparing them and discovering the hidden identity which exists.", "We must inquire, for example, whether or not imagination (connected with consciousness), memory, wit, and analysis are not merely different forms of understanding and reason.", "The idea of a fundamental power, the existence of which no effort of logic can assure us of, is the problem to be solved, for the systematic representation of the existing variety of powers.", "The logical principle of reason requires us to produce as great a unity as is possible in the system of our cognitions; and the more the phenomena of this and the other power are found to be identical, the more probable does it become, that they are nothing but different manifestations of one and the same power, which may be called, relatively speaking, a fundamental power.", "And so with other cases.", "These relatively fundamental powers must again be compared with each other, to discover, if possible, the one radical and absolutely fundamental power of which they are but the manifestations.", "But this unity is purely hypothetical.", "It is not maintained, that this unity does really exist, but that we must, in the interest of reason, that is, for the establishment of principles for the various rules presented by experience, try to discover and introduce it, so far as is practicable, into the sphere of our cognitions.", "But the transcendental employment of the understanding would lead us to believe that this idea of a fundamental power is not problematical, but that it possesses objective reality, and thus the systematic unity of the various powers or forces in a substance is demanded by the understanding and erected into an apodeictic or necessary principle.", "For, without having attempted to discover the unity of the various powers existing in nature, nay, even after all our attempts have failed, we notwithstanding presuppose that it does exist, and may be, sooner or later, discovered.", "And this reason does, not only, as in the case above adduced, with regard to the unity of substance, but where many substances, although all to a certain extent homogeneous, are discoverable, as in the case of matter in general.", "Here also does reason presuppose the existence of the systematic unity of various powersâ€inasmuch as particular laws of nature are subordinate to general laws; and parsimony in principles is not merely an economical principle of reason, but an essential law of nature.", "We cannot understand, in fact, how a logical principle of unity can of right exist, unless we presuppose a transcendental principle, by which such a systematic unitâ€as a property of objects themselvesâ€is regarded as necessary Ã  priori.", "For with what right can reason, in its logical exercise, require us to regard the variety of forces which nature displays, as in effect a disguised unity, and to deduce them from one fundamental force or power, when she is free to admit that it is just as possible that all forces should be different in kind, and that a systematic unity is not conformable to the design of nature?", "In this view of the case, reason would be proceeding in direct opposition to her own destination, by setting as an aim an idea which entirely conflicts with the procedure and arrangement of nature.", "Neither can we assert that reason has previously inferred this unity from the contingent nature of phenomena.", "For the law of reason which requires us to seek for this unity is a necessary law, inasmuch as without it we should not possess a faculty of reason, nor without reason a consistent and self accordant mode of employing the understanding, nor, in the absence of this, any proper and sufficient criterion of empirical truth.", "In relation to this criterion, therefore, we must suppose the idea of the systematic unity of nature to possess objective validity and necessity.", "We find this transcendental presupposition lurking in different forms in the principles of philosophers, although they have neither recognized it nor confessed to themselves its presence.", "That the diversities of individual things do not exclude identity of species, that the various species must be considered as merely different determinations of a few genera, and these again as divisions of still higher races, and so onâ€that, accordingly, a certain systematic unity of all possible empirical conceptions, in so far as they can be deduced from higher and more general conceptions, must be sought for, is a scholastic maxim or logical principle, without which reason could not be employed by us.", "For we can infer the particular from the general, only in so far as general properties of things constitute the foundation upon which the particular rest.", "That the same unity exists in nature is presupposed by philosophers in the well known scholastic maxim, which forbids us unnecessarily to augment the number of entities or principles (entia praeter necessitatem non esse multiplicanda).", "This maxim asserts that nature herself assists in the establishment of this unity of reason, and that the seemingly infinite diversity of phenomena should not deter us from the expectation of discovering beneath this diversity a unity of fundamental properties, of which the aforesaid variety is but a more or less determined form.", "This unity, although a mere idea, thinkers have found it necessary rather to moderate the desire than to encourage it.", "It was considered a great step when chemists were able to reduce all salts to two main generaâ€acids and alkalis; and they regard this difference as itself a mere variety, or different manifestation of one and the same fundamental material.", "The different kinds of earths (stones and even metals) chemists have endeavoured to reduce to three, and afterwards to two; but still, not content with this advance, they cannot but think that behind these diversities there lurks but one genusâ€nay, that even salts and earths have a common principle.", "It might be conjectured that this is merely an economical plan of reason, for the purpose of sparing itself trouble, and an attempt of a purely hypothetical character, which, when successful, gives an appearance of probability to the principle of explanation employed by the reason.", "But a selfish purpose of this kind is easily to be distinguished from the idea, according to which every one presupposes that this unity is in accordance with the laws of nature, and that reason does not in this case request, but requires, although we are quite unable to determine the proper limits of this unity.", "If the diversity existing in phenomenaâ€a diversity not of form (for in this they may be similar) but of contentâ€were so great that the subtlest human reason could never by comparison discover in them the least similarity (which is not impossible), in this case the logical law of genera would be without foundation, the conception of a genus, nay, all general conceptions would be impossible, and the faculty of the understanding, the exercise of which is restricted to the world of conceptions, could not exist.", "The logical principle of genera, accordingly, if it is to be applied to nature (by which I mean objects presented to our senses), presupposes a transcendental principle.", "In accordance with this principle, homogeneity is necessarily presupposed in the variety of phenomena (although we are unable to determine Ã  priori the degree of this homogeneity), because without it no empirical conceptions, and consequently no experience, would be possible.", "The logical principle of genera, which demands identity in phenomena, is balanced by another principleâ€that of species, which requires variety and diversity in things, notwithstanding their accordance in the same genus, and directs the understanding to attend to the one no less than to the other.", "This principle (of the faculty of distinction) acts as a check upon the reason and reason exhibits in this respect a double and conflicting interestâ€on the one hand, the interest in the extent (the interest of generality) in relation to genera; on the other, that of the content (the interest of individuality) in relation to the variety of species.", "In the former case, the understanding cogitates more under its conceptions, in the latter it cogitates more in them.", "This distinction manifests itself likewise in the habits of thought peculiar to natural philosophers, some of whomâ€the remarkably speculative headsâ€may be said to be hostile to heterogeneity in phenomena, and have their eyes always fixed on the unity of genera, while othersâ€with a strong empirical tendencyâ€aim unceasingly at the analysis of phenomena, and almost destroy in us the hope of ever being able to estimate the character of these according to general principles.", "The latter mode of thought is evidently based upon a logical principle, the aim of which is the systematic completeness of all cognitions.", "This principle authorizes me, beginning at the genus, to descend to the various and diverse contained under it; and in this way extension, as in the former case unity, is assured to the system.", "For if we merely examine the sphere of the conception which indicates a genus, we cannot discover how far it is possible to proceed in the division of that sphere; just as it is impossible, from the consideration of the space occupied by matter, to determine how far we can proceed in the division of it.", "Hence every genus must contain different species, and these again different subspecies; and as each of the latter must itself contain a sphere (must be of a certain extent, as a conceptus communis), reason demands that no species or sub species is to be considered as the lowest possible.", "For a species or sub species, being always a conception, which contains only what is common to a number of different things, does not completely determine any individual thing, or relate immediately to it, and must consequently contain other conceptions, that is, other sub species under it.", "This law of specification may be thus expressed  entium varietates non temere sunt minuendae.", "But it is easy to see that this logical law would likewise be without sense or application, were it not based upon a transcendental law of specification, which certainly does not require that the differences existing phenomena should be infinite in number, for the logical principle, which merely maintains the indeterminateness of the logical sphere of a conception, in relation to its possible division, does not authorize this statement; while it does impose upon the understanding the duty of searching for subspecies to every species, and minor differences in every difference.", "For, were there no lower conceptions, neither could there be any higher.", "Now the understanding cognizes only by means of conceptions; consequently, how far soever it may proceed in division, never by mere intuition, but always by lower and lower conceptions.", "The cognition of phenomena in their complete determination (which is possible only by means of the understanding) requires an unceasingly continued specification of conceptions, and a progression to ever smaller differences, of which abstraction bad been made in the conception of the species, and still more in that of the genus.", "This law of specification cannot be deduced from experience; it can never present us with a principle of so universal an application.", "Empirical specification very soon stops in its distinction of diversities, and requires the guidance of the transcendental law, as a principle of the reasonâ€a law which imposes on us the necessity of never ceasing in our search for differences, even although these may not present themselves to the senses.", "That absorbent earths are of different kinds could only be discovered by obeying the anticipatory law of reason, which imposes upon the understanding the task of discovering the differences existing between these earths, and supposes that nature is richer in substances than our senses would indicate.", "The faculty of the understanding belongs to us just as much under the presupposition of differences in the objects of nature, as under the condition that these objects are homogeneous, because we could not possess conceptions, nor make any use of our understanding, were not the phenomena included under these conceptions in some respects dissimilar, as well as similar, in their character.", "Reason thus prepares the sphere of the understanding for the operations of this faculty  1.", "By the principle of the homogeneity of the diverse in higher genera; 2.", "By the principle of the variety of the homogeneous in lower species; and, to complete the systematic unity, it adds, 3.", "A law of the affinity of all conceptions which prescribes a continuous transition from one species to every other by the gradual increase of diversity.", "We may term these the principles of the homogeneity, the specification, and the continuity of forms.", "The latter results from the union of the two former, inasmuch as we regard the systematic connection as complete in thought, in the ascent to higher genera, as well as in the descent to lower species.", "For all diversities must be related to each other, as they all spring from one highest genus, descending through the different gradations of a more and more extended determination.", "We may illustrate the systematic unity produced by the three logical principles in the following manner.", "Every conception may be regarded as a point, which, as the standpoint of a spectator, has a certain horizon, which may be said to enclose a number of things that may be viewed, so to speak, from that centre.", "Within this horizon there must be an infinite number of other points, each of which has its own horizon, smaller and more circumscribed; in other words, every species contains sub species, according to the principle of specification, and the logical horizon consists of smaller horizons (subspecies), but not of points (individuals), which possess no extent.", "But different horizons or genera, which include under them so many conceptions, may have one common horizon, from which, as from a mid point, they may be surveyed; and we may proceed thus, till we arrive at the highest genus, or universal and true horizon, which is determined by the highest conception, and which contains under itself all differences and varieties, as genera, species, and subspecies.", "To this highest standpoint I am conducted by the law of homogeneity, as to all lower and more variously determined conceptions by the law of specification.", "Now as in this way there exists no void in the whole extent of all possible conceptions, and as out of the sphere of these the mind can discover nothing, there arises from the presupposition of the universal horizon above mentioned, and its complete division, the principle  Non datur vacuum formarum.", "This principle asserts that there are not different primitive and highest genera, which stand isolated, so to speak, from each other, but all the various genera are mere divisions and limitations of one highest and universal genus; and hence follows immediately the principle  Datur continuum formarum.", "This principle indicates that all differences of species limit each other, and do not admit of transition from one to another by a saltus, but only through smaller degrees of the difference between the one species and the other.", "In one word, there are no species or sub species which (in the view of reason) are the nearest possible to each other; intermediate species or sub species being always possible, the difference of which from each of the former is always smaller than the difference existing between these.", "The first law, therefore, directs us to avoid the notion that there exist different primal genera, and enounces the fact of perfect homogeneity; the second imposes a check upon this tendency to unity and prescribes the distinction of sub species, before proceeding to apply our general conceptions to individuals.", "The third unites both the former, by enouncing the fact of homogeneity as existing even in the most various diversity, by means of the gradual transition from one species to another.", "Thus it indicates a relationship between the different branches or species, in so far as they all spring from the same stem.", "But this logical law of the continuum specierum (formarum logicarum) presupposes a transcendental principle (lex continui in natura), without which the understanding might be led into error, by following the guidance of the former, and thus perhaps pursuing a path contrary to that prescribed by nature.", "This law must, consequently, be based upon pure transcendental, and not upon empirical, considerations.", "For, in the latter case, it would come later than the system; whereas it is really itself the parent of all that is systematic in our cognition of nature.", "These principles are not mere hypotheses employed for the purpose of experimenting upon nature; although when any such connection is discovered, it forms a solid ground for regarding the hypothetical unity as valid in the sphere of natureâ€and thus they are in this respect not without their use.", "But we go farther, and maintain that it is manifest that these principles of parsimony in fundamental causes, variety in effects, and affinity in phenomena, are in accordance both with reason and nature, and that they are not mere methods or plans devised for the purpose of assisting us in our observation of the external world.", "But it is plain that this continuity of forms is a mere idea, to which no adequate object can be discovered in experience.", "And this for two reasons.", "First, because the species in nature are really divided, and hence form quanta discreta; and, if the gradual progression through their affinity were continuous, the intermediate members lying between two given species must be infinite in number, which is impossible.", "Secondly, because we cannot make any determinate empirical use of this law, inasmuch as it does not present us with any criterion of affinity which could aid us in determining how far we ought to pursue the graduation of differences  it merely contains a general indication that it is our duty to seek for and, if possible, to discover them.", "When we arrange these principles of systematic unity in the order conformable to their employment in experience, they will stand thus  Variety, Affinity, Unity, each of them, as ideas, being taken in the highest degree of their completeness.", "Reason presupposes the existence of cognitions of the understanding, which have a direct relation to experience, and aims at the ideal unity of these cognitionsâ€a unity which far transcends all experience or empirical notions.", "The affinity of the diverse, notwithstanding the differences existing between its parts, has a relation to things, but a still closer one to the mere properties and powers of things.", "For example, imperfect experience may represent the orbits of the planets as circular.", "But we discover variations from this course, and we proceed to suppose that the planets revolve in a path which, if not a circle, is of a character very similar to it.", "That is to say, the movements of those planets which do not form a circle will approximate more or less to the properties of a circle, and probably form an ellipse.", "The paths of comets exhibit still greater variations, for, so far as our observation extends, they do not return upon their own course in a circle or ellipse.", "But we proceed to the conjecture that comets describe a parabola, a figure which is closely allied to the ellipse.", "In fact, a parabola is merely an ellipse, with its longer axis produced to an indefinite extent.", "Thus these principles conduct us to a unity in the genera of the forms of these orbits, and, proceeding farther, to a unity as regards the cause of the motions of the heavenly bodiesâ€that is, gravitation.", "But we go on extending our conquests over nature, and endeavour to explain all seeming deviations from these rules, and even make additions to our system which no experience can ever substantiateâ€for example, the theory, in affinity with that of ellipses, of hyperbolic paths of comets, pursuing which, these bodies leave our solar system and, passing from sun to sun, unite the most distant parts of the infinite universe, which is held together by the same moving power.", "The most remarkable circumstance connected with these principles is that they seem to be transcendental, and, although only containing ideas for the guidance of the empirical exercise of reason, and although this empirical employment stands to these ideas in an asymptotic relation alone (to use a mathematical term), that is, continually approximate, without ever being able to attain to them, they possess, notwithstanding, as Ã  priori synthetical propositions, objective though undetermined validity, and are available as rules for possible experience.", "In the elaboration of our experience, they may also be employed with great advantage, as heuristic[70] principles.", "A transcendental deduction of them cannot be made; such a deduction being always impossible in the case of ideas, as has been already shown.", "[70] From the Greek, eurhioko.", "We distinguished, in the Transcendental Analytic, the dynamical principles of the understanding, which are regulative principles of intuition, from the mathematical, which are constitutive principles of intuition.", "These dynamical laws are, however, constitutive in relation to experience, inasmuch as they render the conceptions without which experience could not exist possible Ã  priori.", "But the principles of pure reason cannot be constitutive even in regard to empirical conceptions, because no sensuous schema corresponding to them can be discovered, and they cannot therefore have an object in concreto.", "Now, if I grant that they cannot be employed in the sphere of experience, as constitutive principles, how shall I secure for them employment and objective validity as regulative principles, and in what way can they be so employed?", "The understanding is the object of reason, as sensibility is the object of the understanding.", "The production of systematic unity in all the empirical operations of the understanding is the proper occupation of reason; just as it is the business of the understanding to connect the various content of phenomena by means of conceptions, and subject them to empirical laws.", "But the operations of the understanding are, without the schemata of sensibility, undetermined; and, in the same manner, the unity of reason is perfectly undetermined as regards the conditions under which, and the extent to which, the understanding ought to carry the systematic connection of its conceptions.", "But, although it is impossible to discover in intuition a schema for the complete systematic unity of all the conceptions of the understanding, there must be some analogon of this schema.", "This analogon is the idea of the maximum of the division and the connection of our cognition in one principle.", "For we may have a determinate notion of a maximum and an absolutely perfect, all the restrictive conditions which are connected with an indeterminate and various content having been abstracted.", "Thus the idea of reason is analogous with a sensuous schema, with this difference, that the application of the categories to the schema of reason does not present a cognition of any object (as is the case with the application of the categories to sensuous schemata), but merely provides us with a rule or principle for the systematic unity of the exercise of the understanding.", "Now, as every principle which imposes upon the exercise of the understanding Ã  priori compliance with the rule of systematic unity also relates, although only in an indirect manner, to an object of experience, the principles of pure reason will also possess objective reality and validity in relation to experience.", "But they will not aim at determining our knowledge in regard to any empirical object; they will merely indicate the procedure, following which the empirical and determinate exercise of the understanding may be in complete harmony and connection with itselfâ€a result which is produced by its being brought into harmony with the principle of systematic unity, so far as that is possible, and deduced from it.", "I term all subjective principles, which are not derived from observation of the constitution of an object, but from the interest which Reason has in producing a certain completeness in her cognition of that object, maxims of reason.", "Thus there are maxims of speculative reason, which are based solely upon its speculative interest, although they appear to be objective principles.", "When principles which are really regulative are regarded as constitutive, and employed as objective principles, contradictions must arise; but if they are considered as mere maxims, there is no room for contradictions of any kind, as they then merely indicate the different interests of reason, which occasion differences in the mode of thought.", "In effect, Reason has only one single interest, and the seeming contradiction existing between her maxims merely indicates a difference in, and a reciprocal limitation of, the methods by which this interest is satisfied.", "This reasoner has at heart the interest of diversityâ€in accordance with the principle of specification; another, the interest of unityâ€in accordance with the principle of aggregation.", "Each believes that his judgement rests upon a thorough insight into the subject he is examining, and yet it has been influenced solely by a greater or less degree of adherence to some one of the two principles, neither of which are objective, but originate solely from the interest of reason, and on this account to be termed maxims rather than principles.", "When I observe intelligent men disputing about the distinctive characteristics of men, animals, or plants, and even of minerals, those on the one side assuming the existence of certain national characteristics, certain well defined and hereditary distinctions of family, race, and so on, while the other side maintain that nature has endowed all races of men with the same faculties and dispositions, and that all differences are but the result of external and accidental circumstancesâ€I have only to consider for a moment the real nature of the subject of discussion, to arrive at the conclusion that it is a subject far too deep for us to judge of, and that there is little probability of either party being able to speak from a perfect insight into and understanding of the nature of the subject itself.", "Both have, in reality, been struggling for the twofold interest of reason; the one maintaining the one interest, the other the other.", "But this difference between the maxims of diversity and unity may easily be reconciled and adjusted; although, so long as they are regarded as objective principles, they must occasion not only contradictions and polemic, but place hinderances in the way of the advancement of truth, until some means is discovered of reconciling these conflicting interests, and bringing reason into union and harmony with itself.", "The same is the case with the so called law discovered by Leibnitz, and supported with remarkable ability by Bonnetâ€the law of the continuous gradation of created beings, which is nothing more than an inference from the principle of affinity; for observation and study of the order of nature could never present it to the mind as an objective truth.", "The steps of this ladder, as they appear in experience, are too far apart from each other, and the so called petty differences between different kinds of animals are in nature commonly so wide separations that no confidence can be placed in such views (particularly when we reflect on the great variety of things, and the ease with which we can discover resemblances), and no faith in the laws which are said to express the aims and purposes of nature.", "On the other hand, the method of investigating the order of nature in the light of this principle, and the maxim which requires us to regard this orderâ€it being still undetermined how far it extendsâ€as really existing in nature, is beyond doubt a legitimate and excellent principle of reasonâ€a principle which extends farther than any experience or observation of ours and which, without giving us any positive knowledge of anything in the region of experience, guides us to the goal of systematic unity.", "Of the Ultimate End of the Natural Dialectic of Human Reason.", "The ideas of pure reason cannot be, of themselves and in their own nature, dialectical; it is from their misemployment alone that fallacies and illusions arise.", "For they originate in the nature of reason itself, and it is impossible that this supreme tribunal for all the rights and claims of speculation should be itself undeserving of confidence and promotive of error.", "It is to be expected, therefore, that these ideas have a genuine and legitimate aim.", "It is true, the mob of sophists raise against reason the cry of inconsistency and contradiction, and affect to despise the government of that faculty, because they cannot understand its constitution, while it is to its beneficial influences alone that they owe the position and the intelligence which enable them to criticize and to blame its procedure.", "We cannot employ an Ã  priori conception with certainty, until we have made a transcendental deduction therefore.", "The ideas of pure reason do not admit of the same kind of deduction as the categories.", "But if they are to possess the least objective validity, and to represent anything but mere creations of thought (entia rationis ratiocinantis), a deduction of them must be possible.", "This deduction will complete the critical task imposed upon pure reason; and it is to this part Of our labours that we now proceed.", "There is a great difference between a thingâ€™s being presented to the mind as an object in an absolute sense, or merely as an ideal object.", "In the former case I employ my conceptions to determine the object; in the latter case nothing is present to the mind but a mere schema, which does not relate directly to an object, not even in a hypothetical sense, but which is useful only for the purpose of representing other objects to the mind, in a mediate and indirect manner, by means of their relation to the idea in the intellect.", "Thus I say the conception of a supreme intelligence is a mere idea; that is to say, its objective reality does not consist in the fact that it has an immediate relation to an object (for in this sense we have no means of establishing its objective validity), it is merely a schema constructed according to the necessary conditions of the unity of reasonâ€the schema of a thing in general, which is useful towards the production of the highest degree of systematic unity in the empirical exercise of reason, in which we deduce this or that object of experience from the imaginary object of this idea, as the ground or cause of the said object of experience.", "In this way, the idea is properly a heuristic, and not an ostensive, conception; it does not give us any information respecting the constitution of an object, it merely indicates how, under the guidance of the idea, we ought to investigate the constitution and the relations of objects in the world of experience.", "Now, if it can be shown that the three kinds of transcendental ideas (psychological, cosmological, and theological), although not relating directly to any object nor determining it, do nevertheless, on the supposition of the existence of an ideal object, produce systematic unity in the laws of the empirical employment of the reason, and extend our empirical cognition, without ever being inconsistent or in opposition with itâ€it must be a necessary maxim of reason to regulate its procedure according to these ideas.", "And this forms the transcendental deduction of all speculative ideas, not as constitutive principles of the extension of our cognition beyond the limits of our experience, but as regulative principles of the systematic unity of empirical cognition, which is by the aid of these ideas arranged and emended within its own proper limits, to an extent unattainable by the operation of the principles of the understanding alone.", "I shall make this plainer.", "Guided by the principles involved in these ideas, we must, in the first place, so connect all the phenomena, actions, and feelings of the mind, as if it were a simple substance, which, endowed with personal identity, possesses a permanent existence (in this life at least), while its states, among which those of the body are to be included as external conditions, are in continual change.", "Secondly, in cosmology, we must investigate the conditions of all natural phenomena, internal as well as external, as if they belonged to a chain infinite and without any prime or supreme member, while we do not, on this account, deny the existence of intelligible grounds of these phenomena, although we never employ them to explain phenomena, for the simple reason that they are not objects of our cognition.", "Thirdly, in the sphere of theology, we must regard the whole system of possible experience as forming an absolute, but dependent and sensuously conditioned unity, and at the same time as based upon a sole, supreme, and all sufficient ground existing apart from the world itselfâ€a ground which is a self subsistent, primeval and creative reason, in relation to which we so employ our reason in the field of experience, as if all objects drew their origin from that archetype of all reason.", "In other words, we ought not to deduce the internal phenomena of the mind from a simple thinking substance, but deduce them from each other under the guidance of the regulative idea of a simple being; we ought not to deduce the phenomena, order, and unity of the universe from a supreme intelligence, but merely draw from this idea of a supremely wise cause the rules which must guide reason in its connection of causes and effects.", "Now there is nothing to hinder us from admitting these ideas to possess an objective and hyperbolic existence, except the cosmological ideas, which lead reason into an antinomy  the psychological and theological ideas are not antinomial.", "They contain no contradiction; and how, then, can any one dispute their objective reality, since he who denies it knows as little about their possibility as we who affirm?", "And yet, when we wish to admit the existence of a thing, it is not sufficient to convince ourselves that there is no positive obstacle in the way; for it cannot be allowable to regard mere creations of thought, which transcend, though they do not contradict, all our conceptions, as real and determinate objects, solely upon the authority of a speculative reason striving to compass its own aims.", "They cannot, therefore, be admitted to be real in themselves; they can only possess a comparative realityâ€that of a schema of the regulative principle of the systematic unity of all cognition.", "They are to be regarded not as actual things, but as in some measure analogous to them.", "We abstract from the object of the idea all the conditions which limit the exercise of our understanding, but which, on the other hand, are the sole conditions of our possessing a determinate conception of any given thing.", "And thus we cogitate a something, of the real nature of which we have not the least conception, but which we represent to ourselves as standing in a relation to the whole system of phenomena, analogous to that in which phenomena stand to each other.", "By admitting these ideal beings, we do not really extend our cognitions beyond the objects of possible experience; we extend merely the empirical unity of our experience, by the aid of systematic unity, the schema of which is furnished by the idea, which is therefore validâ€not as a constitutive, but as a regulative principle.", "For although we posit a thing corresponding to the ideaâ€a something, an actual existenceâ€we do not on that account aim at the extension of our cognition by means of transcendent conceptions.", "This existence is purely ideal, and not objective; it is the mere expression of the systematic unity which is to be the guide of reason in the field of experience.", "There are no attempts made at deciding what the ground of this unity may be, or what the real nature of this imaginary being.", "Thus the transcendental and only determinate conception of God, which is presented to us by speculative reason, is in the strictest sense deistic.", "In other words, reason does not assure us of the objective validity of the conception; it merely gives us the idea of something, on which the supreme and necessary unity of all experience is based.", "This something we cannot, following the analogy of a real substance, cogitate otherwise than as the cause of all things operating in accordance with rational laws, if we regard it as an individual object; although we should rest contented with the idea alone as a regulative principle of reason, and make no attempt at completing the sum of the conditions imposed by thought.", "This attempt is, indeed, inconsistent with the grand aim of complete systematic unity in the sphere of cognitionâ€a unity to which no bounds are set by reason.", "Hence it happens that, admitting a divine being, I can have no conception of the internal possibility of its perfection, or of the necessity of its existence.", "The only advantage of this admission is that it enables me to answer all other questions relating to the contingent, and to give reason the most complete satisfaction as regards the unity which it aims at attaining in the world of experience.", "But I cannot satisfy reason with regard to this hypothesis itself; and this proves that it is not its intelligence and insight into the subject, but its speculative interest alone which induces it to proceed from a point lying far beyond the sphere of our cognition, for the purpose of being able to consider all objects as parts of a systematic whole.", "Here a distinction presents itself, in regard to the way in which we may cogitate a presuppositionâ€a distinction which is somewhat subtle, but of great importance in transcendental philosophy.", "I may have sufficient grounds to admit something, or the existence of something, in a relative point of view (suppositio relativa), without being justified in admitting it in an absolute sense (suppositio absoluta).", "This distinction is undoubtedly requisite, in the case of a regulative principle, the necessity of which we recognize, though we are ignorant of the source and cause of that necessity, and which we assume to be based upon some ultimate ground, for the purpose of being able to cogitate the universality of the principle in a more determinate way.", "For example, I cogitate the existence of a being corresponding to a pure transcendental idea.", "But I cannot admit that this being exists absolutely and in itself, because all of the conceptions by which I can cogitate an object in a determinate manner fall short of assuring me of its existence; nay, the conditions of the objective validity of my conceptions are excluded by the ideaâ€by the very fact of its being an idea.", "The conceptions of reality, substance, causality, nay, even that of necessity in existence, have no significance out of the sphere of empirical cognition, and cannot, beyond that sphere, determine any object.", "They may, accordingly, be employed to explain the possibility of things in the world of sense, but they are utterly inadequate to explain the possibility of the universe itself considered as a whole; because in this case the ground of explanation must lie out of and beyond the world, and cannot, therefore, be an object of possible experience.", "Now, I may admit the existence of an incomprehensible being of this natureâ€the object of a mere idea, relatively to the world of sense; although I have no ground to admit its existence absolutely and in itself.", "For if an idea (that of a systematic and complete unity, of which I shall presently speak more particularly) lies at the foundation of the most extended empirical employment of reason, and if this idea cannot be adequately represented in concreto, although it is indispensably necessary for the approximation of empirical unity to the highest possible degreeâ€I am not only authorized, but compelled, to realize this idea, that is, to posit a real object corresponding thereto.", "But I cannot profess to know this object; it is to me merely a something, to which, as the ground of systematic unity in cognition, I attribute such properties as are analogous to the conceptions employed by the understanding in the sphere of experience.", "Following the analogy of the notions of reality, substance, causality, and necessity, I cogitate a being, which possesses all these attributes in the highest degree; and, as this idea is the offspring of my reason alone, I cogitate this being as self subsistent reason, and as the cause of the universe operating by means of ideas of the greatest possible harmony and unity.", "Thus I abstract all conditions that would limit my idea, solely for the purpose of rendering systematic unity possible in the world of empirical diversity, and thus securing the widest possible extension for the exercise of reason in that sphere.", "This I am enabled to do, by regarding all connections and relations in the world of sense, as if they were the dispositions of a supreme reason, of which our reason is but a faint image.", "I then proceed to cogitate this Supreme Being by conceptions which have, properly, no meaning or application, except in the world of sense.", "But as I am authorized to employ the transcendental hypothesis of such a being in a relative respect alone, that is, as the substratum of the greatest possible unity in experienceâ€I may attribute to a being which I regard as distinct from the world, such properties as belong solely to the sphere of sense and experience.", "For I do not desire, and am not justified in desiring, to cognize this object of my idea, as it exists in itself; for I possess no conceptions sufficient for or task, those of reality, substance, causality, nay, even that of necessity in existence, losing all significance, and becoming merely the signs of conceptions, without content and without applicability, when I attempt to carry them beyond the limits of the world of sense.", "I cogitate merely the relation of a perfectly unknown being to the greatest possible systematic unity of experience, solely for the purpose of employing it as the schema of the regulative principle which directs reason in its empirical exercise.", "It is evident, at the first view, that we cannot presuppose the reality of this transcendental object, by means of the conceptions of reality, substance, causality, and so on, because these conceptions cannot be applied to anything that is distinct from the world of sense.", "Thus the supposition of a Supreme Being or cause is purely relative; it is cogitated only in behalf of the systematic unity of experience; such a being is but a something, of whose existence in itself we have not the least conception.", "Thus, too, it becomes sufficiently manifest why we required the idea of a necessary being in relation to objects given by sense, although we can never have the least conception of this being, or of its absolute necessity.", "And now we can clearly perceive the result of our transcendental dialectic, and the proper aim of the ideas of pure reasonâ€which become dialectical solely from misunderstanding and inconsiderateness.", "Pure reason is, in fact, occupied with itself, and not with any object.", "Objects are not presented to it to be embraced in the unity of an empirical conception; it is only the cognitions of the understanding that are presented to it, for the purpose of receiving the unity of a rational conception, that is, of being connected according to a principle.", "The unity of reason is the unity of system; and this systematic unity is not an objective principle, extending its dominion over objects, but a subjective maxim, extending its authority over the empirical cognition of objects.", "The systematic connection which reason gives to the empirical employment of the understanding not only advances the extension of that employment, but ensures its correctness, and thus the principle of a systematic unity of this nature is also objective, although only in an indefinite respect (principium vagum).", "It is not, however, a constitutive principle, determining an object to which it directly relates; it is merely a regulative principle or maxim, advancing and strengthening the empirical exercise of reason, by the opening up of new paths of which the understanding is ignorant, while it never conflicts with the laws of its exercise in the sphere of experience.", "But reason cannot cogitate this systematic unity, without at the same time cogitating an object of the ideaâ€an object that cannot be presented in any experience, which contains no concrete example of a complete systematic unity.", "This being (ens rationis ratiocinatae) is therefore a mere idea and is not assumed to be a thing which is real absolutely and in itself.", "On the contrary, it forms merely the problematical foundation of the connection which the mind introduces among the phenomena of the sensuous world.", "We look upon this connection, in the light of the above mentioned idea, as if it drew its origin from the supposed being which corresponds to the idea.", "And yet all we aim at is the possession of this idea as a secure foundation for the systematic unity of experienceâ€a unity indispensable to reason, advantageous to the understanding, and promotive of the interests of empirical cognition.", "We mistake the true meaning of this idea when we regard it as an enouncement, or even as a hypothetical declaration of the existence of a real thing, which we are to regard as the origin or ground of a systematic constitution of the universe.", "On the contrary, it is left completely undetermined what the nature or properties of this so called ground may be.", "The idea is merely to be adopted as a point of view, from which this unity, so essential to reason and so beneficial to the understanding, may be regarded as radiating.", "In one word, this transcendental thing is merely the schema of a regulative principle, by means of which Reason, so far as in her lies, extends the dominion of systematic unity over the whole sphere of experience.", "The first object of an idea of this kind is the ego, considered merely as a thinking nature or soul.", "If I wish to investigate the properties of a thinking being, I must interrogate experience.", "But I find that I can apply none of the categories to this object, the schema of these categories, which is the condition of their application, being given only in sensuous intuition.", "But I cannot thus attain to the cognition of a systematic unity of all the phenomena of the internal sense.", "Instead, therefore, of an empirical conception of what the soul really is, reason takes the conception of the empirical unity of all thought, and, by cogitating this unity as unconditioned and primitive, constructs the rational conception or idea of a simple substance which is in itself unchangeable, possessing personal identity, and in connection with other real things external to it; in one word, it constructs the idea of a simple self subsistent intelligence.", "But the real aim of reason in this procedure is the attainment of principles of systematic unity for the explanation of the phenomena of the soul.", "That is, reason desires to be able to represent all the determinations of the internal sense as existing in one subject, all powers as deduced from one fundamental power, all changes as mere varieties in the condition of a being which is permanent and always the same, and all phenomena in space as entirely different in their nature from the procedure of thought.", "Essential simplicity (with the other attributes predicated of the ego) is regarded as the mere schema of this regulative principle; it is not assumed that it is the actual ground of the properties of the soul.", "For these properties may rest upon quite different grounds, of which we are completely ignorant; just as the above predicates could not give us any knowledge of the soul as it is in itself, even if we regarded them as valid in respect of it, inasmuch as they constitute a mere idea, which cannot be represented in concreto.", "Nothing but good can result from a psychological idea of this kind, if we only take proper care not to consider it as more than an idea; that is, if we regard it as valid merely in relation to the employment of reason, in the sphere of the phenomena of the soul.", "Under the guidance of this idea, or principle, no empirical laws of corporeal phenomena are called in to explain that which is a phenomenon of the internal sense alone; no windy hypotheses of the generation, annihilation, and palingenesis of souls are admitted.", "Thus the consideration of this object of the internal sense is kept pure, and unmixed with heterogeneous elements; while the investigation of reason aims at reducing all the grounds of explanation employed in this sphere of knowledge to a single principle.", "All this is best effected, nay, cannot be effected otherwise than by means of such a schema, which requires us to regard this ideal thing as an actual existence.", "The psychological idea is, therefore, meaningless and inapplicable, except as the schema of a regulative conception.", "For, if I ask whether the soul is not really of a spiritual natureâ€it is a question which has no meaning.", "From such a conception has been abstracted, not merely all corporeal nature, but all nature, that is, all the predicates of a possible experience; and consequently, all the conditions which enable us to cogitate an object to this conception have disappeared.", "But, if these conditions are absent, it is evident that the conception is meaningless.", "The second regulative idea of speculative reason is the conception of the universe.", "For nature is properly the only object presented to us, in regard to which reason requires regulative principles.", "Nature is twofoldâ€thinking and corporeal nature.", "To cogitate the latter in regard to its internal possibility, that is, to determine the application of the categories to it, no idea is requiredâ€no representation which transcends experience.", "In this sphere, therefore, an idea is impossible, sensuous intuition being our only guide; while, in the sphere of psychology, we require the fundamental idea (I), which contains Ã  priori a certain form of thought namely, the unity of the ego.", "Pure reason has, therefore, nothing left but nature in general, and the completeness of conditions in nature in accordance with some principle.", "The absolute totality of the series of these conditions is an idea, which can never be fully realized in the empirical exercise of reason, while it is serviceable as a rule for the procedure of reason in relation to that totality.", "It requires us, in the explanation of given phenomena (in the regress or ascent in the series), to proceed as if the series were infinite in itself, that is, were prolonged in indefinitum; while on the other hand, where reason is regarded as itself the determining cause (in the region of freedom), we are required to proceed as if we had not before us an object of sense, but of the pure understanding.", "In this latter case, the conditions do not exist in the series of phenomena, but may be placed quite out of and beyond it, and the series of conditions may be regarded as if it had an absolute beginning from an intelligible cause.", "All this proves that the cosmological ideas are nothing but regulative principles, and not constitutive; and that their aim is not to realize an actual totality in such series.", "The full discussion of this subject will be found in its proper place in the chapter on the antinomy of pure reason.", "The third idea of pure reason, containing the hypothesis of a being which is valid merely as a relative hypothesis, is that of the one and all sufficient cause of all cosmological series, in other words, the idea of God.", "We have not the slightest ground absolutely to admit the existence of an object corresponding to this idea; for what can empower or authorize us to affirm the existence of a being of the highest perfectionâ€a being whose existence is absolutely necessaryâ€merely because we possess the conception of such a being?", "The answer is  It is the existence of the world which renders this hypothesis necessary.", "But this answer makes it perfectly evident that the idea of this being, like all other speculative ideas, is essentially nothing more than a demand upon reason that it shall regulate the connection which it and its subordinate faculties introduce into the phenomena of the world by principles of systematic unity and, consequently, that it shall regard all phenomena as originating from one all embracing being, as the supreme and all sufficient cause.", "From this it is plain that the only aim of reason in this procedure is the establishment of its own formal rule for the extension of its dominion in the world of experience; that it does not aim at an extension of its cognition beyond the limits of experience; and that, consequently, this idea does not contain any constitutive principle.", "The highest formal unity, which is based upon ideas alone, is the unity of all thingsâ€a unity in accordance with an aim or purpose; and the speculative interest of reason renders it necessary to regard all order in the world as if it originated from the intention and design of a supreme reason.", "This principle unfolds to the view of reason in the sphere of experience new and enlarged prospects, and invites it to connect the phenomena of the world according to teleological laws, and in this way to attain to the highest possible degree of systematic unity.", "The hypothesis of a supreme intelligence, as the sole cause of the universeâ€an intelligence which has for us no more than an ideal existenceâ€is accordingly always of the greatest service to reason.", "Thus, if we presuppose, in relation to the figure of the earth (which is round, but somewhat flattened at the poles),[71] or that of mountains or seas, wise designs on the part of an author of the universe, we cannot fail to make, by the light of this supposition, a great number of interesting discoveries.", "If we keep to this hypothesis, as a principle which is purely regulative, even error cannot be very detrimental.", "For, in this case, error can have no more serious consequences than that, where we expected to discover a teleological connection (nexus finalis), only a mechanical or physical connection appears.", "In such a case, we merely fail to find the additional form of unity we expected, but we do not lose the rational unity which the mind requires in its procedure in experience.", "But even a miscarriage of this sort cannot affect the law in its general and teleological relations.", "For although we may convict an anatomist of an error, when he connects the limb of some animal with a certain purpose, it is quite impossible to prove in a single case that any arrangement of nature, be it what it may, is entirely without aim or design.", "And thus medical physiology, by the aid of a principle presented to it by pure reason, extends its very limited empirical knowledge of the purposes of the different parts of an organized body so far that it may be asserted with the utmost confidence, and with the approbation of all reflecting men, that every organ or bodily part of an animal has its use and answers a certain design.", "Now, this is a supposition which, if regarded as of a constitutive character, goes much farther than any experience or observation of ours can justify.", "Hence it is evident that it is nothing more than a regulative principle of reason, which aims at the highest degree of systematic unity, by the aid of the idea of a causality according to design in a supreme causeâ€a cause which it regards as the highest intelligence.", "[71] The advantages which a circular form, in the case of the earth,  has over every other, are well known.", "But few are aware that the  slight flattening at the poles, which gives it the figure of a  spheroid, is the only cause which prevents the elevations of  continents or even of mountains, perhaps thrown up by some internal  convulsion, from continually altering the position of the axis of the  earthâ€and that to some considerable degree in a short time.", "The great  protuberance of the earth under the Equator serves to overbalance the  impetus of all other masses of earth, and thus to preserve the axis of  the earth, so far as we can observe, in its present position.", "And yet  this wise arrangement has been unthinkingly explained from the  equilibrium of the formerly fluid mass.", "If, however, we neglect this restriction of the idea to a purely regulative influence, reason is betrayed into numerous errors.", "For it has then left the ground of experience, in which alone are to be found the criteria of truth, and has ventured into the region of the incomprehensible and unsearchable, on the heights of which it loses its power and collectedness, because it has completely severed its connection with experience.", "The first error which arises from our employing the idea of a Supreme Being as a constitutive (in repugnance to the very nature of an idea), and not as a regulative principle, is the error of inactive reason (ignava ratio).", "[72] We may so term every principle which requires us to regard our investigations of nature as absolutely complete, and allows reason to cease its inquiries, as if it had fully executed its task.", "Thus the psychological idea of the ego, when employed as a constitutive principle for the explanation of the phenomena of the soul, and for the extension of our knowledge regarding this subject beyond the limits of experienceâ€even to the condition of the soul after deathâ€is convenient enough for the purposes of pure reason, but detrimental and even ruinous to its interests in the sphere of nature and experience.", "The dogmatizing spiritualist explains the unchanging unity of our personality through all changes of condition from the unity of a thinking substance, the interest which we take in things and events that can happen only after our death, from a consciousness of the immaterial nature of our thinking subject, and so on.", "Thus he dispenses with all empirical investigations into the cause of these internal phenomena, and with all possible explanations of them upon purely natural grounds; while, at the dictation of a transcendent reason, he passes by the immanent sources of cognition in experience, greatly to his own ease and convenience, but to the sacrifice of all, genuine insight and intelligence.", "These prejudicial consequences become still more evident, in the case of the dogmatical treatment of our idea of a Supreme Intelligence, and the theological system of nature (physico theology) which is falsely based upon it.", "For, in this case, the aims which we observe in nature, and often those which we merely fancy to exist, make the investigation of causes a very easy task, by directing us to refer such and such phenomena immediately to the unsearchable will and counsel of the Supreme Wisdom, while we ought to investigate their causes in the general laws of the mechanism of matter.", "We are thus recommended to consider the labour of reason as ended, when we have merely dispensed with its employment, which is guided surely and safely only by the order of nature and the series of changes in the worldâ€which are arranged according to immanent and general laws.", "This error may be avoided, if we do not merely consider from the view point of final aims certain parts of nature, such as the division and structure of a continent, the constitution and direction of certain mountain chains, or even the organization existing in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, but look upon this systematic unity of nature in a perfectly general way, in relation to the idea of a Supreme Intelligence.", "If we pursue this advice, we lay as a foundation for all investigation the conformity to aims of all phenomena of nature in accordance with universal laws, for which no particular arrangement of nature is exempt, but only cognized by us with more or less difficulty; and we possess a regulative principle of the systematic unity of a teleological connection, which we do not attempt to anticipate or predetermine.", "All that we do, and ought to do, is to follow out the physico mechanical connection in nature according to general laws, with the hope of discovering, sooner or later, the teleological connection also.", "Thus, and thus only, can the principle of final unity aid in the extension of the employment of reason in the sphere of experience, without being in any case detrimental to its interests.", "[72] This was the term applied by the old dialecticians to a  sophistical argument, which ran thus  If it is your fate to die of  this disease, you will die, whether you employ a physician or not.", "Cicero says that this mode of reasoning has received this appellation,  because, if followed, it puts an end to the employment of reason in  the affairs of life.", "For a similar reason, I have applied this  designation to the sophistical argument of pure reason.", "The second error which arises from the misconception of the principle of systematic unity is that of perverted reason (perversa ratio, usteron roteron rationis).", "The idea of systematic unity is available as a regulative principle in the connection of phenomena according to general natural laws; and, how far soever we have to travel upon the path of experience to discover some fact or event, this idea requires us to believe that we have approached all the more nearly to the completion of its use in the sphere of nature, although that completion can never be attained.", "But this error reverses the procedure of reason.", "We begin by hypostatizing the principle of systematic unity, and by giving an anthropomorphic determination to the conception of a Supreme Intelligence, and then proceed forcibly to impose aims upon nature.", "Thus not only does teleology, which ought to aid in the completion of unity in accordance with general laws, operate to the destruction of its influence, but it hinders reason from attaining its proper aim, that is, the proof, upon natural grounds, of the existence of a supreme intelligent cause.", "For, if we cannot presuppose supreme finality in nature Ã  priori, that is, as essentially belonging to nature, how can we be directed to endeavour to discover this unity and, rising gradually through its different degrees, to approach the supreme perfection of an author of allâ€a perfection which is absolutely necessary, and therefore cognizable Ã  priori?", "The regulative principle directs us to presuppose systematic unity absolutely and, consequently, as following from the essential nature of thingsâ€but only as a unity of nature, not merely cognized empirically, but presupposed Ã  priori, although only in an indeterminate manner.", "But if I insist on basing nature upon the foundation of a supreme ordaining Being, the unity of nature is in effect lost.", "For, in this case, it is quite foreign and unessential to the nature of things, and cannot be cognized from the general laws of nature.", "And thus arises a vicious circular argument, what ought to have been proved having been presupposed.", "To take the regulative principle of systematic unity in nature for a constitutive principle, and to hypostatize and make a cause out of that which is properly the ideal ground of the consistent and harmonious exercise of reason, involves reason in inextricable embarrassments.", "The investigation of nature pursues its own path under the guidance of the chain of natural causes, in accordance with the general laws of nature, and ever follows the light of the idea of an author of the universeâ€not for the purpose of deducing the finality, which it constantly pursues, from this Supreme Being, but to attain to the cognition of his existence from the finality which it seeks in the existence of the phenomena of nature, and, if possible, in that of all things to cognize this being, consequently, as absolutely necessary.", "Whether this latter purpose succeed or not, the idea is and must always be a true one, and its employment, when merely regulative, must always be accompanied by truthful and beneficial results.", "Complete unity, in conformity with aims, constitutes absolute perfection.", "But if we do not find this unity in the nature of the things which go to constitute the world of experience, that is, of objective cognition, consequently in the universal and necessary laws of nature, how can we infer from this unity the idea of the supreme and absolutely necessary perfection of a primal being, which is the origin of all causality?", "The greatest systematic unity, and consequently teleological unity, constitutes the very foundation of the possibility of the most extended employment of human reason.", "The idea of unity is therefore essentially and indissolubly connected with the nature of our reason.", "This idea is a legislative one; and hence it is very natural that we should assume the existence of a legislative reason corresponding to it, from which the systematic unity of natureâ€the object of the operations of reasonâ€must be derived.", "In the course of our discussion of the antinomies, we stated that it is always possible to answer all the questions which pure reason may raise; and that the plea of the limited nature of our cognition, which is unavoidable and proper in many questions regarding natural phenomena, cannot in this case be admitted, because the questions raised do not relate to the nature of things, but are necessarily originated by the nature of reason itself, and relate to its own internal constitution.", "We can now establish this assertion, which at first sight appeared so rash, in relation to the two questions in which reason takes the greatest interest, and thus complete our discussion of the dialectic of pure reason.", "If, then, the question is asked, in relation to transcendental theology,[73] first, whether there is anything distinct from the world, which contains the ground of cosmical order and connection according to general laws?", "The answer is  Certainly.", "For the world is a sum of phenomena; there must, therefore, be some transcendental basis of these phenomena, that is, a basis cogitable by the pure understanding alone.", "If, secondly, the question is asked whether this being is substance, whether it is of the greatest reality, whether it is necessary, and so forth?", "I answer that this question is utterly without meaning.", "For all the categories which aid me in forming a conception of an object cannot be employed except in the world of sense, and are without meaning when not applied to objects of actual or possible experience.", "Out of this sphere, they are not properly conceptions, but the mere marks or indices of conceptions, which we may admit, although they cannot, without the help of experience, help us to understand any subject or thing.", "If, thirdly, the question is whether we may not cogitate this being, which is distinct from the world, in analogy with the objects of experience?", "The answer is  Undoubtedly, but only as an ideal, and not as a real object.", "That is, we must cogitate it only as an unknown substratum of the systematic unity, order, and finality of the worldâ€a unity which reason must employ as the regulative principle of its investigation of nature.", "Nay, more, we may admit into the idea certain anthropomorphic elements, which are promotive of the interests of this regulative principle.", "For it is no more than an idea, which does not relate directly to a being distinct from the world, but to the regulative principle of the systematic unity of the world, by means, however, of a schema of this unityâ€the schema of a Supreme Intelligence, who is the wisely designing author of the universe.", "What this basis of cosmical unity may be in itself, we know notâ€we cannot discover from the idea; we merely know how we ought to employ the idea of this unity, in relation to the systematic operation of reason in the sphere of experience.", "[73] After what has been said of the psychological idea of the ego and  its proper employment as a regulative principle of the operations of  reason, I need not enter into details regarding the transcendental  illusion by which the systematic unity of all the various phenomena of  the internal sense is hypostatized.", "The procedure is in this case very  similar to that which has been discussed in our remarks on the  theological ideal.", "But, it will be asked again, can we on these grounds, admit the existence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world?", "Without doubt; and not only so, but we must assume the existence of such a being.", "But do we thus extend the limits of our knowledge beyond the field of possible experience?", "By no means.", "For we have merely presupposed a something, of which we have no conception, which we do not know as it is in itself; but, in relation to the systematic disposition of the universe, which we must presuppose in all our observation of nature, we have cogitated this unknown being in analogy with an intelligent existence (an empirical conception), that is to say, we have endowed it with those attributes, which, judging from the nature of our own reason, may contain the ground of such a systematic unity.", "This idea is therefore valid only relatively to the employment in experience of our reason.", "But if we attribute to it absolute and objective validity, we overlook the fact that it is merely an ideal being that we cogitate; and, by setting out from a basis which is not determinable by considerations drawn from experience, we place ourselves in a position which incapacitates us from applying this principle to the empirical employment of reason.", "But, it will be asked further, can I make any use of this conception and hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature?", "Yes, for this very purpose was the idea established by reason as a fundamental basis.", "But may I regard certain arrangements, which seemed to have been made in conformity with some fixed aim, as the arrangements of design, and look upon them as proceeding from the divine will, with the intervention, however, of certain other particular arrangements disposed to that end?", "Yes, you may do so; but at the same time you must regard it as indifferent, whether it is asserted that divine wisdom has disposed all things in conformity with his highest aims, or that the idea of supreme wisdom is a regulative principle in the investigation of nature, and at the same time a principle of the systematic unity of nature according to general laws, even in those cases where we are unable to discover that unity.", "In other words, it must be perfectly indifferent to you whether you say, when you have discovered this unity  God has wisely willed it so; or  Nature has wisely arranged this.", "For it was nothing but the systematic unity, which reason requires as a basis for the investigation of nature, that justified you in accepting the idea of a supreme intelligence as a schema for a regulative principle; and, the farther you advance in the discovery of design and finality, the more certain the validity of your idea.", "But, as the whole aim of this regulative principle was the discovery of a necessary and systematic unity in nature, we have, in so far as we attain this, to attribute our success to the idea of a Supreme Being; while, at the same time, we cannot, without involving ourselves in contradictions, overlook the general laws of nature, as it was in reference to them alone that this idea was employed.", "We cannot, I say, overlook the general laws of nature, and regard this conformity to aims observable in nature as contingent or hyperphysical in its origin; inasmuch as there is no ground which can justify us in the admission of a being with such properties distinct from and above nature.", "All that we are authorized to assert is that this idea may be employed as a principle, and that the properties of the being which is assumed to correspond to it may be regarded as systematically connected in analogy with the causal determination of phenomena.", "For the same reasons we are justified in introducing into the idea of the supreme cause other anthropomorphic elements (for without these we could not predicate anything of it); we may regard it as allowable to cogitate this cause as a being with understanding, the feelings of pleasure and displeasure, and faculties of desire and will corresponding to these.", "At the same time, we may attribute to this being infinite perfectionâ€a perfection which necessarily transcends that which our knowledge of the order and design in the world authorize us to predicate of it.", "For the regulative law of systematic unity requires us to study nature on the supposition that systematic and final unity in infinitum is everywhere discoverable, even in the highest diversity.", "For, although we may discover little of this cosmical perfection, it belongs to the legislative prerogative of reason to require us always to seek for and to expect it; while it must always be beneficial to institute all inquiries into nature in accordance with this principle.", "But it is evident that, by this idea of a supreme author of all, which I place as the foundation of all inquiries into nature, I do not mean to assert the existence of such a being, or that I have any knowledge of its existence; and, consequently, I do not really deduce anything from the existence of this being, but merely from its idea, that is to say, from the nature of things in this world, in accordance with this idea.", "A certain dim consciousness of the true use of this idea seems to have dictated to the philosophers of all times the moderate language used by them regarding the cause of the world.", "We find them employing the expressions wisdom and care of nature, and divine wisdom, as synonymousâ€nay, in purely speculative discussions, preferring the former, because it does not carry the appearance of greater pretensions than such as we are entitled to make, and at the same time directs reason to its proper field of actionâ€nature and her phenomena.", "Thus, pure reason, which at first seemed to promise us nothing less than the extension of our cognition beyond the limits of experience, is found, when thoroughly examined, to contain nothing but regulative principles, the virtue and function of which is to introduce into our cognition a higher degree of unity than the understanding could of itself.", "These principles, by placing the goal of all our struggles at so great a distance, realize for us the most thorough connection between the different parts of our cognition, and the highest degree of systematic unity.", "But, on the other hand, if misunderstood and employed as constitutive principles of transcendent cognition, they become the parents of illusions and contradictions, while pretending to introduce us to new regions of knowledge.", "Thus all human cognition begins with intuitions, proceeds from thence to conceptions, and ends with ideas.", "Although it possesses, in relation to all three elements, Ã  priori sources of cognition, which seemed to transcend the limits of all experience, a thoroughgoing criticism demonstrates that speculative reason can never, by the aid of these elements, pass the bounds of possible experience, and that the proper destination of this highest faculty of cognition is to employ all methods, and all the principles of these methods, for the purpose of penetrating into the innermost secrets of nature, by the aid of the principles of unity (among all kinds of which teleological unity is the highest), while it ought not to attempt to soar above the sphere of experience, beyond which there lies nought for us but the void inane.", "The critical examination, in our Transcendental Analytic, of all the propositions which professed to extend cognition beyond the sphere of experience, completely demonstrated that they can only conduct us to a possible experience.", "If we were not distrustful even of the clearest abstract theorems, if we were not allured by specious and inviting prospects to escape from the constraining power of their evidence, we might spare ourselves the laborious examination of all the dialectical arguments which a transcendent reason adduces in support of its pretensions; for we should know with the most complete certainty that, however honest such professions might be, they are null and valueless, because they relate to a kind of knowledge to which no man can by any possibility attain.", "But, as there is no end to discussion, if we cannot discover the true cause of the illusions by which even the wisest are deceived, and as the analysis of all our transcendent cognition into its elements is of itself of no slight value as a psychological study, while it is a duty incumbent on every philosopherâ€it was found necessary to investigate the dialectical procedure of reason in its primary sources.", "And as the inferences of which this dialectic is the parent are not only deceitful, but naturally possess a profound interest for humanity, it was advisable at the same time, to give a full account of the momenta of this dialectical procedure, and to deposit it in the archives of human reason, as a warning to all future metaphysicians to avoid these causes of speculative error.", "II.", "Transcendental Doctrine of Method   If we regard the sum of the cognition of pure speculative reason as an edifice, the idea of which, at least, exists in the human mind, it may be said that we have in the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements examined the materials and determined to what edifice these belong, and what its height and stability.", "We have found, indeed, that, although we had purposed to build for ourselves a tower which should reach to Heaven, the supply of materials sufficed merely for a habitation, which was spacious enough for all terrestrial purposes, and high enough to enable us to survey the level plain of experience, but that the bold undertaking designed necessarily failed for want of materialsâ€not to mention the confusion of tongues, which gave rise to endless disputes among the labourers on the plan of the edifice, and at last scattered them over all the world, each to erect a separate building for himself, according to his own plans and his own inclinations.", "Our present task relates not to the materials, but to the plan of an edifice; and, as we have had sufficient warning not to venture blindly upon a design which may be found to transcend our natural powers, while, at the same time, we cannot give up the intention of erecting a secure abode for the mind, we must proportion our design to the material which is presented to us, and which is, at the same time, sufficient for all our wants.", "I understand, then, by the transcendental doctrine of method, the determination of the formal conditions of a complete system of pure reason.", "We shall accordingly have to treat of the discipline, the canon, the architectonic, and, finally, the history of pure reason.", "This part of our Critique will accomplish, from the transcendental point of view, what has been usually attempted, but miserably executed, under the name of practical logic.", "It has been badly executed, I say, because general logic, not being limited to any particular kind of cognition (not even to the pure cognition of the understanding) nor to any particular objects, it cannot, without borrowing from other sciences, do more than present merely the titles or signs of possible methods and the technical expressions, which are employed in the systematic parts of all sciences; and thus the pupil is made acquainted with names, the meaning and application of which he is to learn only at some future time.", "Chapter I. The Discipline of Pure Reason  Negative judgementsâ€those which are so not merely as regards their logical form, but in respect of their contentâ€are not commonly held in especial respect.", "They are, on the contrary, regarded as jealous enemies of our insatiable desire for knowledge; and it almost requires an apology to induce us to tolerate, much less to prize and to respect them.", "All propositions, indeed, may be logically expressed in a negative form; but, in relation to the content of our cognition, the peculiar province of negative judgements is solely to prevent error.", "For this reason, too, negative propositions, which are framed for the purpose of correcting false cognitions where error is absolutely impossible, are undoubtedly true, but inane and senseless; that is, they are in reality purposeless and, for this reason, often very ridiculous.", "Such is the proposition of the schoolman that Alexander could not have subdued any countries without an army.", "But where the limits of our possible cognition are very much contracted, the attraction to new fields of knowledge great, the illusions to which the mind is subject of the most deceptive character, and the evil consequences of error of no inconsiderable magnitudeâ€the negative element in knowledge, which is useful only to guard us against error, is of far more importance than much of that positive instruction which makes additions to the sum of our knowledge.", "The restraint which is employed to repress, and finally to extirpate the constant inclination to depart from certain rules, is termed discipline.", "It is distinguished from culture, which aims at the formation of a certain degree of skill, without attempting to repress or to destroy any other mental power, already existing.", "In the cultivation of a talent, which has given evidence of an impulse towards self development, discipline takes a negative,[74] culture and doctrine a positive, part.", "[74] I am well aware that, in the language of the schools, the term  discipline is usually employed as synonymous with instruction.", "But  there are so many cases in which it is necessary to distinguish the  notion of the former, as a course of corrective training, from that of  the latter, as the communication of knowledge, and the nature of  things itself demands the appropriation of the most suitable  expressions for this distinction, that it is my desire that the former  terms should never be employed in any other than a negative  signification.", "That natural dispositions and talents (such as imagination and wit), which ask a free and unlimited development, require in many respects the corrective influence of discipline, every one will readily grant.", "But it may well appear strange that reason, whose proper duty it is to prescribe rules of discipline to all the other powers of the mind, should itself require this corrective.", "It has, in fact, hitherto escaped this humiliation, only because, in presence of its magnificent pretensions and high position, no one could readily suspect it to be capable of substituting fancies for conceptions, and words for things.", "Reason, when employed in the field of experience, does not stand in need of criticism, because its principles are subjected to the continual test of empirical observations.", "Nor is criticism requisite in the sphere of mathematics, where the conceptions of reason must always be presented in concreto in pure intuition, and baseless or arbitrary assertions are discovered without difficulty.", "But where reason is not held in a plain track by the influence of empirical or of pure intuition, that is, when it is employed in the transcendental sphere of pure conceptions, it stands in great need of discipline, to restrain its propensity to overstep the limits of possible experience and to keep it from wandering into error.", "In fact, the utility of the philosophy of pure reason is entirely of this negative character.", "Particular errors may be corrected by particular animadversions, and the causes of these errors may be eradicated by criticism.", "But where we find, as in the case of pure reason, a complete system of illusions and fallacies, closely connected with each other and depending upon grand general principles, there seems to be required a peculiar and negative code of mental legislation, which, under the denomination of a discipline, and founded upon the nature of reason and the objects of its exercise, shall constitute a system of thorough examination and testing, which no fallacy will be able to withstand or escape from, under whatever disguise or concealment it may lurk.", "But the reader must remark that, in this the second division of our transcendental Critique the discipline of pure reason is not directed to the content, but to the method of the cognition of pure reason.", "The former task has been completed in the doctrine of elements.", "But there is so much similarity in the mode of employing the faculty of reason, whatever be the object to which it is applied, while, at the same time, its employment in the transcendental sphere is so essentially different in kind from every other, that, without the warning negative influence of a discipline specially directed to that end, the errors are unavoidable which spring from the unskillful employment of the methods which are originated by reason but which are out of place in this sphere.", "Section I. The Discipline of Pure Reason in the Sphere of Dogmatism  The science of mathematics presents the most brilliant example of the extension of the sphere of pure reason without the aid of experience.", "Examples are always contagious; and they exert an especial influence on the same faculty, which naturally flatters itself that it will have the same good fortune in other case as fell to its lot in one fortunate instance.", "Hence pure reason hopes to be able to extend its empire in the transcendental sphere with equal success and security, especially when it applies the same method which was attended with such brilliant results in the science of mathematics.", "It is, therefore, of the highest importance for us to know whether the method of arriving at demonstrative certainty, which is termed mathematical, be identical with that by which we endeavour to attain the same degree of certainty in philosophy, and which is termed in that science dogmatical.", "Philosophical cognition is the cognition of reason by means of conceptions; mathematical cognition is cognition by means of the construction of conceptions.", "The construction of a conception is the presentation Ã  priori of the intuition which corresponds to the conception.", "For this purpose a non empirical intuition is requisite, which, as an intuition, is an individual object; while, as the construction of a conception (a general representation), it must be seen to be universally valid for all the possible intuitions which rank under that conception.", "Thus I construct a triangle, by the presentation of the object which corresponds to this conception, either by mere imagination, in pure intuition, or upon paper, in empirical intuition, in both cases completely Ã  priori, without borrowing the type of that figure from any experience.", "The individual figure drawn upon paper is empirical; but it serves, notwithstanding, to indicate the conception, even in its universality, because in this empirical intuition we keep our eye merely on the act of the construction of the conception, and pay no attention to the various modes of determining it, for example, its size, the length of its sides, the size of its angles, these not in the least affecting the essential character of the conception.", "Philosophical cognition, accordingly, regards the particular only in the general; mathematical the general in the particular, nay, in the individual.", "This is done, however, entirely Ã  priori and by means of pure reason, so that, as this individual figure is determined under certain universal conditions of construction, the object of the conception, to which this individual figure corresponds as its schema, must be cogitated as universally determined.", "The essential difference of these two modes of cognition consists, therefore, in this formal quality; it does not regard the difference of the matter or objects of both.", "Those thinkers who aim at distinguishing philosophy from mathematics by asserting that the former has to do with quality merely, and the latter with quantity, have mistaken the effect for the cause.", "The reason why mathematical cognition can relate only to quantity is to be found in its form alone.", "For it is the conception of quantities only that is capable of being constructed, that is, presented Ã  priori in intuition; while qualities cannot be given in any other than an empirical intuition.", "Hence the cognition of qualities by reason is possible only through conceptions.", "No one can find an intuition which shall correspond to the conception of reality, except in experience; it cannot be presented to the mind Ã  priori and antecedently to the empirical consciousness of a reality.", "We can form an intuition, by means of the mere conception of it, of a cone, without the aid of experience; but the colour of the cone we cannot know except from experience.", "I cannot present an intuition of a cause, except in an example which experience offers to me.", "Besides, philosophy, as well as mathematics, treats of quantities; as, for example, of totality, infinity, and so on.", "Mathematics, too, treats of the difference of lines and surfacesâ€as spaces of different quality, of the continuity of extensionâ€as a quality thereof.", "But, although in such cases they have a common object, the mode in which reason considers that object is very different in philosophy from what it is in mathematics.", "The former confines itself to the general conceptions; the latter can do nothing with a mere conception, it hastens to intuition.", "In this intuition it regards the conception in concreto, not empirically, but in an Ã  priori intuition, which it has constructed; and in which, all the results which follow from the general conditions of the construction of the conception are in all cases valid for the object of the constructed conception.", "Suppose that the conception of a triangle is given to a philosopher and that he is required to discover, by the philosophical method, what relation the sum of its angles bears to a right angle.", "He has nothing before him but the conception of a figure enclosed within three right lines, and, consequently, with the same number of angles.", "He may analyse the conception of a right line, of an angle, or of the number three as long as he pleases, but he will not discover any properties not contained in these conceptions.", "But, if this question is proposed to a geometrician, he at once begins by constructing a triangle.", "He knows that two right angles are equal to the sum of all the contiguous angles which proceed from one point in a straight line; and he goes on to produce one side of his triangle, thus forming two adjacent angles which are together equal to two right angles.", "He then divides the exterior of these angles, by drawing a line parallel with the opposite side of the triangle, and immediately perceives that he has thus got an exterior adjacent angle which is equal to the interior.", "Proceeding in this way, through a chain of inferences, and always on the ground of intuition, he arrives at a clear and universally valid solution of the question.", "But mathematics does not confine itself to the construction of quantities (quanta), as in the case of geometry; it occupies itself with pure quantity also (quantitas), as in the case of algebra, where complete abstraction is made of the properties of the object indicated by the conception of quantity.", "In algebra, a certain method of notation by signs is adopted, and these indicate the different possible constructions of quantities, the extraction of roots, and so on.", "After having thus denoted the general conception of quantities, according to their different relations, the different operations by which quantity or number is increased or diminished are presented in intuition in accordance with general rules.", "Thus, when one quantity is to be divided by another, the signs which denote both are placed in the form peculiar to the operation of division; and thus algebra, by means of a symbolical construction of quantity, just as geometry, with its ostensive or geometrical construction (a construction of the objects themselves), arrives at results which discursive cognition cannot hope to reach by the aid of mere conceptions.", "Now, what is the cause of this difference in the fortune of the philosopher and the mathematician, the former of whom follows the path of conceptions, while the latter pursues that of intuitions, which he represents, Ã  priori, in correspondence with his conceptions?", "The cause is evident from what has been already demonstrated in the introduction to this Critique.", "We do not, in the present case, want to discover analytical propositions, which may be produced merely by analysing our conceptionsâ€for in this the philosopher would have the advantage over his rival; we aim at the discovery of synthetical propositionsâ€such synthetical propositions, moreover, as can be cognized Ã  priori.", "I must not confine myself to that which I actually cogitate in my conception of a triangle, for this is nothing more than the mere definition; I must try to go beyond that, and to arrive at properties which are not contained in, although they belong to, the conception.", "Now, this is impossible, unless I determine the object present to my mind according to the conditions, either of empirical, or of pure, intuition.", "In the former case, I should have an empirical proposition (arrived at by actual measurement of the angles of the triangle), which would possess neither universality nor necessity; but that would be of no value.", "In the latter, I proceed by geometrical construction, by means of which I collect, in a pure intuition, just as I would in an empirical intuition, all the various properties which belong to the schema of a triangle in general, and consequently to its conception, and thus construct synthetical propositions which possess the attribute of universality.", "It would be vain to philosophize upon the triangle, that is, to reflect on it discursively; I should get no further than the definition with which I had been obliged to set out.", "There are certainly transcendental synthetical propositions which are framed by means of pure conceptions, and which form the peculiar distinction of philosophy; but these do not relate to any particular thing, but to a thing in general, and enounce the conditions under which the perception of it may become a part of possible experience.", "But the science of mathematics has nothing to do with such questions, nor with the question of existence in any fashion; it is concerned merely with the properties of objects in themselves, only in so far as these are connected with the conception of the objects.", "In the above example, we merely attempted to show the great difference which exists between the discursive employment of reason in the sphere of conceptions, and its intuitive exercise by means of the construction of conceptions.", "The question naturally arises  What is the cause which necessitates this twofold exercise of reason, and how are we to discover whether it is the philosophical or the mathematical method which reason is pursuing in an argument?", "All our knowledge relates, finally, to possible intuitions, for it is these alone that present objects to the mind.", "An Ã  priori or non empirical conception contains either a pure intuitionâ€and in this case it can be constructed; or it contains nothing but the synthesis of possible intuitions, which are not given Ã  priori.", "In this latter case, it may help us to form synthetical Ã  priori judgements, but only in the discursive method, by conceptions, not in the intuitive, by means of the construction of conceptions.", "The only Ã  priori intuition is that of the pure form of phenomenaâ€space and time.", "A conception of space and time as quanta may be presented Ã  priori in intuition, that is, constructed, either alone with their quality (figure), or as pure quantity (the mere synthesis of the homogeneous), by means of number.", "But the matter of phenomena, by which things are given in space and time, can be presented only in perception, Ã  posteriori.", "The only conception which represents Ã  priori this empirical content of phenomena is the conception of a thing in general; and the Ã  priori synthetical cognition of this conception can give us nothing more than the rule for the synthesis of that which may be contained in the corresponding Ã  posteriori perception; it is utterly inadequate to present an Ã  priori intuition of the real object, which must necessarily be empirical.", "Synthetical propositions, which relate to things in general, an Ã  priori intuition of which is impossible, are transcendental.", "For this reason transcendental propositions cannot be framed by means of the construction of conceptions; they are Ã  priori, and based entirely on conceptions themselves.", "They contain merely the rule, by which we are to seek in the world of perception or experience the synthetical unity of that which cannot be intuited Ã  priori.", "But they are incompetent to present any of the conceptions which appear in them in an Ã  priori intuition; these can be given only Ã  posteriori, in experience, which, however, is itself possible only through these synthetical principles.", "If we are to form a synthetical judgement regarding a conception, we must go beyond it, to the intuition in which it is given.", "If we keep to what is contained in the conception, the judgement is merely analyticalâ€it is merely an explanation of what we have cogitated in the conception.", "But I can pass from the conception to the pure or empirical intuition which corresponds to it.", "I can proceed to examine my conception in concreto, and to cognize, either Ã  priori or a posterio, what I find in the object of the conception.", "The formerâ€Ã  priori cognitionâ€is rational mathematical cognition by means of the construction of the conception; the latterâ€Ã  posteriori cognitionâ€is purely empirical cognition, which does not possess the attributes of necessity and universality.", "Thus I may analyse the conception I have of gold; but I gain no new information from this analysis, I merely enumerate the different properties which I had connected with the notion indicated by the word.", "My knowledge has gained in logical clearness and arrangement, but no addition has been made to it.", "But if I take the matter which is indicated by this name, and submit it to the examination of my senses, I am enabled to form several syntheticalâ€although still empiricalâ€propositions.", "The mathematical conception of a triangle I should construct, that is, present Ã  priori in intuition, and in this way attain to rational synthetical cognition.", "But when the transcendental conception of reality, or substance, or power is presented to my mind, I find that it does not relate to or indicate either an empirical or pure intuition, but that it indicates merely the synthesis of empirical intuitions, which cannot of course be given Ã  priori.", "The synthesis in such a conception cannot proceed Ã  prioriâ€without the aid of experienceâ€to the intuition which corresponds to the conception; and, for this reason, none of these conceptions can produce a determinative synthetical proposition, they can never present more than a principle of the synthesis[75] of possible empirical intuitions.", "A transcendental proposition is, therefore, a synthetical cognition of reason by means of pure conceptions and the discursive method, and it renders possible all synthetical unity in empirical cognition, though it cannot present us with any intuition Ã  priori.", "[75] In the case of the conception of cause, I do really go beyond the  empirical conception of an eventâ€but not to the intuition which  presents this conception in concreto, but only to the time conditions,  which may be found in experience to correspond to the conception.", "My  procedure is, therefore, strictly according to conceptions; I cannot  in a case of this kind employ the construction of conceptions, because  the conception is merely a rule for the synthesis of perceptions,  which are not pure intuitions, and which, therefore, cannot be given Ã   priori.", "There is thus a twofold exercise of reason.", "Both modes have the properties of universality and an Ã  priori origin in common, but are, in their procedure, of widely different character.", "The reason of this is that in the world of phenomena, in which alone objects are presented to our minds, there are two main elementsâ€the form of intuition (space and time), which can be cognized and determined completely Ã  priori, and the matter or contentâ€that which is presented in space and time, and which, consequently, contains a somethingâ€an existence corresponding to our powers of sensation.", "As regards the latter, which can never be given in a determinate mode except by experience, there are no Ã  priori notions which relate to it, except the undetermined conceptions of the synthesis of possible sensations, in so far as these belong (in a possible experience) to the unity of consciousness.", "As regards the former, we can determine our conceptions Ã  priori in intuition, inasmuch as we are ourselves the creators of the objects of the conceptions in space and timeâ€these objects being regarded simply as quanta.", "In the one case, reason proceeds according to conceptions and can do nothing more than subject phenomena to theseâ€which can only be determined empirically, that is, Ã  posterioriâ€in conformity, however, with those conceptions as the rules of all empirical synthesis.", "In the other case, reason proceeds by the construction of conceptions; and, as these conceptions relate to an Ã  priori intuition, they may be given and determined in pure intuition Ã  priori, and without the aid of empirical data.", "The examination and consideration of everything that exists in space or timeâ€whether it is a quantum or not, in how far the particular something (which fills space or time) is a primary substratum, or a mere determination of some other existence, whether it relates to anything elseâ€either as cause or effect, whether its existence is isolated or in reciprocal connection with and dependence upon others, the possibility of this existence, its reality and necessity or oppositesâ€all these form part of the cognition of reason on the ground of conceptions, and this cognition is termed philosophical.", "But to determine Ã  priori an intuition in space (its figure), to divide time into periods, or merely to cognize the quantity of an intuition in space and time, and to determine it by numberâ€all this is an operation of reason by means of the construction of conceptions, and is called mathematical.", "The success which attends the efforts of reason in the sphere of mathematics naturally fosters the expectation that the same good fortune will be its lot, if it applies the mathematical method in other regions of mental endeavour besides that of quantities.", "Its success is thus great, because it can support all its conceptions by Ã  priori intuitions and, in this way, make itself a master, as it were, over nature; while pure philosophy, with its Ã  priori discursive conceptions, bungles about in the world of nature, and cannot accredit or show any Ã  priori evidence of the reality of these conceptions.", "Masters in the science of mathematics are confident of the success of this method; indeed, it is a common persuasion that it is capable of being applied to any subject of human thought.", "They have hardly ever reflected or philosophized on their favourite scienceâ€a task of great difficulty; and the specific difference between the two modes of employing the faculty of reason has never entered their thoughts.", "Rules current in the field of common experience, and which common sense stamps everywhere with its approval, are regarded by them as axiomatic.", "From what source the conceptions of space and time, with which (as the only primitive quanta) they have to deal, enter their minds, is a question which they do not trouble themselves to answer; and they think it just as unnecessary to examine into the origin of the pure conceptions of the understanding and the extent of their validity.", "All they have to do with them is to employ them.", "In all this they are perfectly right, if they do not overstep the limits of the sphere of nature.", "But they pass, unconsciously, from the world of sense to the insecure ground of pure transcendental conceptions (instabilis tellus, innabilis unda), where they can neither stand nor swim, and where the tracks of their footsteps are obliterated by time; while the march of mathematics is pursued on a broad and magnificent highway, which the latest posterity shall frequent without fear of danger or impediment.", "As we have taken upon us the task of determining, clearly and certainly, the limits of pure reason in the sphere of transcendentalism, and as the efforts of reason in this direction are persisted in, even after the plainest and most expressive warnings, hope still beckoning us past the limits of experience into the splendours of the intellectual worldâ€it becomes necessary to cut away the last anchor of this fallacious and fantastic hope.", "We shall, accordingly, show that the mathematical method is unattended in the sphere of philosophy by the least advantageâ€except, perhaps, that it more plainly exhibits its own inadequacyâ€that geometry and philosophy are two quite different things, although they go band in hand in hand in the field of natural science, and, consequently, that the procedure of the one can never be imitated by the other.", "The evidence of mathematics rests upon definitions, axioms, and demonstrations.", "I shall be satisfied with showing that none of these forms can be employed or imitated in philosophy in the sense in which they are understood by mathematicians; and that the geometrician, if he employs his method in philosophy, will succeed only in building card castles, while the employment of the philosophical method in mathematics can result in nothing but mere verbiage.", "The essential business of philosophy, indeed, is to mark out the limits of the science; and even the mathematician, unless his talent is naturally circumscribed and limited to this particular department of knowledge, cannot turn a deaf ear to the warnings of philosophy, or set himself above its direction.", "I. Of Definitions.", "A definition is, as the term itself indicates, the representation, upon primary grounds, of the complete conception of a thing within its own limits.", "[76] Accordingly, an empirical conception cannot be defined, it can only be explained.", "For, as there are in such a conception only a certain number of marks or signs, which denote a certain class of sensuous objects, we can never be sure that we do not cogitate under the word which indicates the same object, at one time a greater, at another a smaller number of signs.", "Thus, one person may cogitate in his conception of gold, in addition to its properties of weight, colour, malleability, that of resisting rust, while another person may be ignorant of this quality.", "We employ certain signs only so long as we require them for the sake of distinction; new observations abstract some and add new ones, so that an empirical conception never remains within permanent limits.", "It is, in fact, useless to define a conception of this kind.", "If, for example, we are speaking of water and its properties, we do not stop at what we actually think by the word water, but proceed to observation and experiment; and the word, with the few signs attached to it, is more properly a designation than a conception of the thing.", "A definition in this case would evidently be nothing more than a determination of the word.", "In the second place, no Ã  priori conception, such as those of substance, cause, right, fitness, and so on, can be defined.", "For I can never be sure, that the clear representation of a given conception (which is given in a confused state) has been fully developed, until I know that the representation is adequate with its object.", "But, inasmuch as the conception, as it is presented to the mind, may contain a number of obscure representations, which we do not observe in our analysis, although we employ them in our application of the conception, I can never be sure that my analysis is complete, while examples may make this probable, although they can never demonstrate the fact.", "Instead of the word definition, I should rather employ the term expositionâ€a more modest expression, which the critic may accept without surrendering his doubts as to the completeness of the analysis of any such conception.", "As, therefore, neither empirical nor Ã  priori conceptions are capable of definition, we have to see whether the only other kind of conceptionsâ€arbitrary conceptionsâ€can be subjected to this mental operation.", "Such a conception can always be defined; for I must know thoroughly what I wished to cogitate in it, as it was I who created it, and it was not given to my mind either by the nature of my understanding or by experience.", "At the same time, I cannot say that, by such a definition, I have defined a real object.", "If the conception is based upon empirical conditions, if, for example, I have a conception of a clock for a ship, this arbitrary conception does not assure me of the existence or even of the possibility of the object.", "My definition of such a conception would with more propriety be termed a declaration of a project than a definition of an object.", "There are no other conceptions which can bear definition, except those which contain an arbitrary synthesis, which can be constructed Ã  priori.", "Consequently, the science of mathematics alone possesses definitions.", "For the object here thought is presented Ã  priori in intuition; and thus it can never contain more or less than the conception, because the conception of the object has been given by the definitionâ€and primarily, that is, without deriving the definition from any other source.", "Philosophical definitions are, therefore, merely expositions of given conceptions, while mathematical definitions are constructions of conceptions originally formed by the mind itself; the former are produced by analysis, the completeness of which is never demonstratively certain, the latter by a synthesis.", "In a mathematical definition the conception is formed, in a philosophical definition it is only explained.", "From this it follows    [76] The definition must describe the conception completely that is,  omit none of the marks or signs of which it composed; within its own  limits, that is, it must be precise, and enumerate no more signs than  belong to the conception; and on primary grounds, that is to say, the  limitations of the bounds of the conception must not be deduced from  other conceptions, as in this case a proof would be necessary, and the  so called definition would be incapable of taking its place at the  bead of all the judgements we have to form regarding an object.", "(a) That we must not imitate, in philosophy, the mathematical usage of commencing with definitionsâ€except by way of hypothesis or experiment.", "For, as all so called philosophical definitions are merely analyses of given conceptions, these conceptions, although only in a confused form, must precede the analysis; and the incomplete exposition must precede the complete, so that we may be able to draw certain inferences from the characteristics which an incomplete analysis has enabled us to discover, before we attain to the complete exposition or definition of the conception.", "In one word, a full and clear definition ought, in philosophy, rather to form the conclusion than the commencement of our labours.", "[77] In mathematics, on the contrary, we cannot have a conception prior to the definition; it is the definition which gives us the conception, and it must for this reason form the commencement of every chain of mathematical reasoning.", "[77] Philosophy abounds in faulty definitions, especially such as  contain some of the elements requisite to form a complete definition.", "If a conception could not be employed in reasoning before it had been  defined, it would fare ill with all philosophical thought.", "But, as  incompletely defined conceptions may always be employed without  detriment to truth, so far as our analysis of the elements contained  in them proceeds, imperfect definitions, that is, propositions which  are properly not definitions, but merely approximations thereto, may  be used with great advantage.", "In mathematics, definition belongs ad  esse, in philosophy ad melius esse.", "It is a difficult task to  construct a proper definition.", "Jurists are still without a complete  definition of the idea of right.", "(b) Mathematical definitions cannot be erroneous.", "For the conception is given only in and through the definition, and thus it contains only what has been cogitated in the definition.", "But although a definition cannot be incorrect, as regards its content, an error may sometimes, although seldom, creep into the form.", "This error consists in a want of precision.", "Thus the common definition of a circleâ€that it is a curved line, every point in which is equally distant from another point called the centreâ€is faulty, from the fact that the determination indicated by the word curved is superfluous.", "For there ought to be a particular theorem, which may be easily proved from the definition, to the effect that every line, which has all its points at equal distances from another point, must be a curved lineâ€that is, that not even the smallest part of it can be straight.", "Analytical definitions, on the other hand, may be erroneous in many respects, either by the introduction of signs which do not actually exist in the conception, or by wanting in that completeness which forms the essential of a definition.", "In the latter case, the definition is necessarily defective, because we can never be fully certain of the completeness of our analysis.", "For these reasons, the method of definition employed in mathematics cannot be imitated in philosophy.", "2.", "Of Axioms.", "These, in so far as they are immediately certain, are Ã  priori synthetical principles.", "Now, one conception cannot be connected synthetically and yet immediately with another;

although from another point of view, that of experience, it is capable of being proved to demonstration.", "The proper term for such a proposition is principle, and not theorem (although it does require to be proved), because it possesses the remarkable peculiarity of being the condition of the possibility of its own ground of proof, that is, experience, and of forming a necessary presupposition in all empirical observation.", "If then, in the speculative sphere of pure reason, no dogmata are to be found; all dogmatical methods, whether borrowed from mathematics, or invented by philosophical thinkers, are alike inappropriate and inefficient.", "They only serve to conceal errors and fallacies, and to deceive philosophy, whose duty it is to see that reason pursues a safe and straight path.", "A philosophical method may, however, be systematical.", "For our reason is, subjectively considered, itself a system, and, in the sphere of mere conceptions, a system of investigation according to principles of unity, the material being supplied by experience alone.", "But this is not the proper place for discussing the peculiar method of transcendental philosophy, as our present task is simply to examine whether our faculties are capable of erecting an edifice on the basis of pure reason, and how far they may proceed with the materials at their command.", "Section II.", "The Discipline of Pure Reason in Polemics  Reason must be subject, in all its operations, to criticism, which must always be permitted to exercise its functions without restraint;

and thus I know the limitsâ€merely visualâ€of my actual knowledge of the earth, although I am ignorant of the limits of the earth itself.", "But if I have got so far as to know that the earth is a sphere, and that its surface is spherical, I can cognize Ã  priori and determine upon principles, from my knowledge of a small part of this surfaceâ€say to the extent of a degreeâ€the diameter and circumference of the earth; and although I am ignorant of the objects which this surface contains, I have a perfect knowledge of its limits and extent.", "The sum of all the possible objects of our cognition seems to us to be a level surface, with an apparent horizonâ€that which forms the limit of its extent, and which has been termed by us the idea of unconditioned totality.", "To reach this limit by empirical means is impossible, and all attempts to determine it Ã  priori according to a principle, are alike in vain.", "But all the questions raised by pure reason relate to that which lies beyond this horizon, or, at least, in its boundary line.", "The celebrated David Hume was one of those geographers of human reason who believe that they have given a sufficient answer to all such questions by declaring them to lie beyond the horizon of our knowledgeâ€a horizon which, however, Hume was unable to determine.", "His attention especially was directed to the principle of causality; and he remarked with perfect justice that the truth of this principle, and even the objective validity of the conception of a cause, was not commonly based upon clear insight, that is, upon Ã  priori cognition.", "Hence he concluded that this law does not derive its authority from its universality and necessity, but merely from its general applicability in the course of experience, and a kind of subjective necessity thence arising, which he termed habit.", "From the inability of reason to establish this principle as a necessary law for the acquisition of all experience, he inferred the nullity of all the attempts of reason to pass the region of the empirical.", "This procedure of subjecting the facta of reason to examination, and, if necessary, to disapproval, may be termed the censura of reason.", "This censura must inevitably lead us to doubts regarding all transcendent employment of principles.", "But this is only the second step in our inquiry.", "The first step in regard to the subjects of pure reason, and which marks the infancy of that faculty, is that of dogmatism.", "The second, which we have just mentioned, is that of scepticism, and it gives evidence that our judgement has been improved by experience.", "But a third step is necessaryâ€indicative of the maturity and manhood of the judgement, which now lays a firm foundation upon universal and necessary principles.", "This is the period of criticism, in which we do not examine the facta of reason, but reason itself, in the whole extent of its powers, and in regard to its capability of Ã  priori cognition; and thus we determine not merely the empirical and ever shifting bounds of our knowledge, but its necessary and eternal limits.", "We demonstrate from indubitable principles, not merely our ignorance in respect to this or that subject, but in regard to all possible questions of a certain class.", "Thus scepticism is a resting place for reason, in which it may reflect on its dogmatical wanderings and gain some knowledge of the region in which it happens to be, that it may pursue its way with greater certainty; but it cannot be its permanent dwelling place.", "It must take up its abode only in the region of complete certitude, whether this relates to the cognition of objects themselves, or to the limits which bound all our cognition.", "Reason is not to be considered as an indefinitely extended plane, of the bounds of which we have only a general knowledge; it ought rather to be compared to a sphere, the radius of which may be found from the curvature of its surfaceâ€that is, the nature of Ã  priori synthetical propositionsâ€and, consequently, its circumference and extent.", "Beyond the sphere of experience there are no objects which it can cognize; nay, even questions regarding such supposititious objects relate only to the subjective principles of a complete determination of the relations which exist between the understanding conceptions which lie within this sphere.", "We are actually in possession of Ã  priori synthetical cognitions, as is proved by the existence of the principles of the understanding, which anticipate experience.", "If any one cannot comprehend the possibility of these principles, he may have some reason to doubt whether they are really Ã  priori; but he cannot on this account declare them to be impossible, and affirm the nullity of the steps which reason may have taken under their guidance.", "He can only say  If we perceived their origin and their authenticity, we should be able to determine the extent and limits of reason; but, till we can do this, all propositions regarding the latter are mere random assertions.", "In this view, the doubt respecting all dogmatical philosophy, which proceeds without the guidance of criticism, is well grounded; but we cannot therefore deny to reason the ability to construct a sound philosophy, when the way has been prepared by a thorough critical investigation.", "All the conceptions produced, and all the questions raised, by pure reason, do not lie in the sphere of experience, but in that of reason itself, and hence they must be solved, and shown to be either valid or inadmissible, by that faculty.", "We have no right to decline the solution of such problems, on the ground that the solution can be discovered only from the nature of things, and under pretence of the limitation of human faculties, for reason is the sole creator of all these ideas, and is therefore bound either to establish their validity or to expose their illusory nature.", "The polemic of scepticism is properly directed against the dogmatist, who erects a system of philosophy without having examined the fundamental objective principles on which it is based, for the purpose of evidencing the futility of his designs, and thus bringing him to a knowledge of his own powers.", "But, in itself, scepticism does not give us any certain information in regard to the bounds of our knowledge.", "All unsuccessful dogmatical attempts of reason are facia, which it is always useful to submit to the censure of the sceptic.", "But this cannot help us to any decision regarding the expectations which reason cherishes of better success in future endeavours; the investigations of scepticism cannot, therefore, settle the dispute regarding the rights and powers of human reason.", "Hume is perhaps the ablest and most ingenious of all sceptical philosophers, and his writings have, undoubtedly, exerted the most powerful influence in awakening reason to a thorough investigation into its own powers.", "It will, therefore, well repay our labours to consider for a little the course of reasoning which he followed and the errors into which he strayed, although setting out on the path of truth and certitude.", "Hume was probably aware, although he never clearly developed the notion, that we proceed in judgements of a certain class beyond our conception if the object.", "I have termed this kind of judgement synthetical.", "As regard the manner in which I pass beyond my conception by the aid of experience, no doubts can be entertained.", "Experience is itself a synthesis of perceptions; and it employs perceptions to increment the conception, which I obtain by means of another perception.", "But we feel persuaded that we are able to proceed beyond a conception, and to extend our cognition Ã  priori.", "We attempt this in two waysâ€either, through the pure understanding, in relation to that which may become an object of experience, or, through pure reason, in relation to such properties of things, or of the existence of things, as can never be presented in any experience.", "This sceptical philosopher did not distinguish these two kinds of judgements, as he ought to have done, but regarded this augmentation of conceptions, and, if we may so express ourselves, the spontaneous generation of understanding and reason, independently of the impregnation of experience, as altogether impossible.", "The so called Ã  priori principles of these faculties he consequently held to be invalid and imaginary, and regarded them as nothing but subjective habits of thought originating in experience, and therefore purely empirical and contingent rules, to which we attribute a spurious necessity and universality.", "In support of this strange assertion, he referred us to the generally acknowledged principle of the relation between cause and effect.", "No faculty of the mind can conduct us from the conception of a thing to the existence of something else; and hence he believed he could infer that, without experience, we possess no source from which we can augment a conception, and no ground sufficient to justify us in framing a judgement that is to extend our cognition Ã  priori.", "That the light of the sun, which shines upon a piece of wax, at the same time melts it, while it hardens clay, no power of the understanding could infer from the conceptions which we previously possessed of these substances; much less is there any Ã  priori law that could conduct us to such a conclusion, which experience alone can certify.", "On the other hand, we have seen in our discussion of transcendental logic, that, although we can never proceed immediately beyond the content of the conception which is given us, we can always cognize completely Ã  prioriâ€in relation, however, to a third term, namely, possible experienceâ€the law of its connection with other things.", "For example, if I observe that a piece of wax melts, I can cognize Ã  priori that there must have been something (the sunâ€™s heat) preceding, which this law; although, without the aid of experience, I could not cognize Ã  priori and in a determinate manner either the cause from the effect, or the effect from the cause.", "Hume was, therefore, wrong in inferring, from the contingency of the determination according to law, the contingency of the law itself; and the passing beyond the conception of a thing to possible experience (which is an Ã  priori proceeding, constituting the objective reality of the conception), he confounded with our synthesis of objects in actual experience, which is always, of course, empirical.", "Thus, too, he regarded the principle of affinity, which has its seat in the understanding and indicates a necessary connection, as a mere rule of association, lying in the imitative faculty of imagination, which can present only contingent, and not objective connections.", "The sceptical errors of this remarkably acute thinker arose principally from a defect, which was common to him with the dogmatists, namely, that he had never made a systematic review of all the different kinds of Ã  priori synthesis performed by the understanding.", "Had he done so, he would have found, to take one example among many, that the principle of permanence was of this character, and that it, as well as the principle of causality, anticipates experience.", "In this way he might have been able to describe the determinate limits of the Ã  priori operations of understanding and reason.", "But he merely declared the understanding to be limited, instead of showing what its limits were; he created a general mistrust in the power of our faculties, without giving us any determinate knowledge of the bounds of our necessary and unavoidable ignorance; he examined and condemned some of the principles of the understanding, without investigating all its powers with the completeness necessary to criticism.", "He denies, with truth, certain powers to the understanding, but he goes further, and declares it to be utterly inadequate to the Ã  priori extension of knowledge, although he has not fully examined all the powers which reside in the faculty; and thus the fate which always overtakes scepticism meets him too.", "That is to say, his own declarations are doubted, for his objections were based upon facta, which are contingent, and not upon principles, which can alone demonstrate the necessary invalidity of all dogmatical assertions.", "As Hume makes no distinction between the well grounded claims of the understanding and the dialectical pretensions of reason, against which, however, his attacks are mainly directed, reason does not feel itself shut out from all attempts at the extension of Ã  priori cognition, and hence it refuses, in spite of a few checks in this or that quarter, to relinquish such efforts.", "For one naturally arms oneself to resist an attack, and becomes more obstinate in the resolve to establish the claims he has advanced.", "But a complete review of the powers of reason, and the conviction thence arising that we are in possession of a limited field of action, while we must admit the vanity of higher claims, puts an end to all doubt and dispute, and induces reason to rest satisfied with the undisturbed possession of its limited domain.", "To the uncritical dogmatist, who has not surveyed the sphere of his understanding, nor determined, in accordance with principles, the limits of possible cognition, who, consequently, is ignorant of his own powers, and believes he will discover them by the attempts he makes in the field of cognition, these attacks of scepticism are not only dangerous, but destructive.", "For if there is one proposition in his chain of reasoning which be he cannot prove, or the fallacy in which he cannot evolve in accordance with a principle, suspicion falls on all his statements, however plausible they may appear.", "And thus scepticism, the bane of dogmatical philosophy, conducts us to a sound investigation into the understanding and the reason.", "When we are thus far advanced, we need fear no further attacks; for the limits of our domain are clearly marked out, and we can make no claims nor become involved in any disputes regarding the region that lies beyond these limits.", "Thus the sceptical procedure in philosophy does not present any solution of the problems of reason, but it forms an excellent exercise for its powers, awakening its circumspection, and indicating the means whereby it may most fully establish its claims to its legitimate possessions.", "Section III.", "The Discipline of Pure Reason in Hypothesis  This critique of reason has now taught us that all its efforts to extend the bounds of knowledge, by means of pure speculation, are utterly fruitless.", "So much the wider field, it may appear, lies open to hypothesis; as, where we cannot know with certainty, we are at liberty to make guesses and to form suppositions.", "Imagination may be allowed, under the strict surveillance of reason, to invent suppositions; but, these must be based on something that is perfectly certainâ€and that is the possibility of the object.", "If we are well assured upon this point, it is allowable to have recourse to supposition in regard to the reality of the object; but this supposition must, unless it is utterly groundless, be connected, as its ground of explanation, with that which is really given and absolutely certain.", "Such a supposition is termed a hypothesis.", "It is beyond our power to form the least conception Ã  priori of the possibility of dynamical connection in phenomena; and the category of the pure understanding will not enable us to excogitate any such connection, but merely helps us to understand it, when we meet with it in experience.", "For this reason we cannot, in accordance with the categories, imagine or invent any object or any property of an object not given, or that may not be given in experience, and employ it in a hypothesis; otherwise, we should be basing our chain of reasoning upon mere chimerical fancies, and not upon conceptions of things.", "Thus, we have no right to assume the existence of new powers, not existing in natureâ€for example, an understanding with a non sensuous intuition, a force of attraction without contact, or some new kind of substances occupying space, and yet without the property of impenetrabilityâ€and, consequently, we cannot assume that there is any other kind of community among substances than that observable in experience, any kind of presence than that in space, or any kind of duration than that in time.", "In one word, the conditions of possible experience are for reason the only conditions of the possibility of things; reason cannot venture to form, independently of these conditions, any conceptions of things, because such conceptions, although not self contradictory, are without object and without application.", "The conceptions of reason are, as we have already shown, mere ideas, and do not relate to any object in any kind of experience.", "At the same time, they do not indicate imaginary or possible objects.", "They are purely problematical in their nature and, as aids to the heuristic exercise of the faculties, form the basis of the regulative principles for the systematic employment of the understanding in the field of experience.", "If we leave this ground of experience, they become mere fictions of thought, the possibility of which is quite indemonstrable; and they cannot, consequently, be employed as hypotheses in the explanation of real phenomena.", "It is quite admissible to cogitate the soul as simple, for the purpose of enabling ourselves to employ the idea of a perfect and necessary unity of all the faculties of the mind as the principle of all our inquiries into its internal phenomena, although we cannot cognize this unity in concreto.", "But to assume that the soul is a simple substance (a transcendental conception) would be enouncing a proposition which is not only indemonstrableâ€as many physical hypotheses areâ€but a proposition which is purely arbitrary, and in the highest degree rash.", "The simple is never presented in experience; and, if by substance is here meant the permanent object of sensuous intuition, the possibility of a simple phenomenon is perfectly inconceivable.", "Reason affords no good grounds for admitting the existence of intelligible beings, or of intelligible properties of sensuous things, althoughâ€as we have no conception either of their possibility or of their impossibilityâ€it will always be out of our power to affirm dogmatically that they do not exist.", "In the explanation of given phenomena, no other things and no other grounds of explanation can be employed than those which stand in connection with the given phenomena according to the known laws of experience.", "A transcendental hypothesis, in which a mere idea of reason is employed to explain the phenomena of nature, would not give us any better insight into a phenomenon, as we should be trying to explain what we do not sufficiently understand from known empirical principles, by what we do not understand at all.", "The principles of such a hypothesis might conduce to the satisfaction of reason, but it would not assist the understanding in its application to objects.", "Order and conformity to aims in the sphere of nature must be themselves explained upon natural grounds and according to natural laws; and the wildest hypotheses, if they are only physical, are here more admissible than a hyperphysical hypothesis, such as that of a divine author.", "For such a hypothesis would introduce the principle of ignava ratio, which requires us to give up the search for causes that might be discovered in the course of experience and to rest satisfied with a mere idea.", "As regards the absolute totality of the grounds of explanation in the series of these causes, this can be no hindrance to the understanding in the case of phenomena; because, as they are to us nothing more than phenomena, we have no right to look for anything like completeness in the synthesis of the series of their conditions.", "Transcendental hypotheses are therefore inadmissible; and we cannot use the liberty of employing, in the absence of physical, hyperphysical grounds of explanation.", "And this for two reasons; first, because such hypothesis do not advance reason, but rather stop it in its progress; secondly, because this licence would render fruitless all its exertions in its own proper sphere, which is that of experience.", "For, when the explanation of natural phenomena happens to be difficult, we have constantly at hand a transcendental ground of explanation, which lifts us above the necessity of investigating nature; and our inquiries are brought to a close, not because we have obtained all the requisite knowledge, but because we abut upon a principle which is incomprehensible and which, indeed, is so far back in the track of thought as to contain the conception of the absolutely primal being.", "The next requisite for the admissibility of a hypothesis is its sufficiency.", "That is, it must determine Ã  priori the consequences which are given in experience and which are supposed to follow from the hypothesis itself.", "If we require to employ auxiliary hypotheses, the suspicion naturally arises that they are mere fictions; because the necessity for each of them requires the same justification as in the case of the original hypothesis, and thus their testimony is invalid.", "If we suppose the existence of an infinitely perfect cause, we possess sufficient grounds for the explanation of the conformity to aims, the order and the greatness which we observe in the universe; but we find ourselves obliged, when we observe the evil in the world and the exceptions to these laws, to employ new hypothesis in support of the original one.", "We employ the idea of the simple nature of the human soul as the foundation of all the theories we may form of its phenomena; but when we meet with difficulties in our way, when we observe in the soul phenomena similar to the changes which take place in matter, we require to call in new auxiliary hypotheses.", "These may, indeed, not be false, but we do not know them to be true, because the only witness to their certitude is the hypothesis which they themselves have been called in to explain.", "We are not discussing the above mentioned assertions regarding the immaterial unity of the soul and the existence of a Supreme Being as dogmata, which certain philosophers profess to demonstrate Ã  priori, but purely as hypotheses.", "In the former case, the dogmatist must take care that his arguments possess the apodeictic certainty of a demonstration.", "For the assertion that the reality of such ideas is probable is as absurd as a proof of the probability of a proposition in geometry.", "Pure abstract reason, apart from all experience, can either cognize nothing at all; and hence the judgements it enounces are never mere opinions, they are either apodeictic certainties, or declarations that nothing can be known on the subject.", "Opinions and probable judgements on the nature of things can only be employed to explain given phenomena, or they may relate to the effect, in accordance with empirical laws, of an actually existing cause.", "In other words, we must restrict the sphere of opinion to the world of experience and nature.", "Beyond this region opinion is mere invention; unless we are groping about for the truth on a path not yet fully known, and have some hopes of stumbling upon it by chance.", "But, although hypotheses are inadmissible in answers to the questions of pure speculative reason, they may be employed in the defence of these answers.", "That is to say, hypotheses are admissible in polemic, but not in the sphere of dogmatism.", "By the defence of statements of this character, I do not mean an attempt at discovering new grounds for their support, but merely the refutation of the arguments of opponents.", "All Ã  priori synthetical propositions possess the peculiarity that, although the philosopher who maintains the reality of the ideas contained in the proposition is not in possession of sufficient knowledge to establish the certainty of his statements, his opponent is as little able to prove the truth of the opposite.", "This equality of fortune does not allow the one party to be superior to the other in the sphere of speculative cognition; and it is this sphere, accordingly, that is the proper arena of these endless speculative conflicts.", "But we shall afterwards show that, in relation to its practical exercise, Reason has the right of admitting what, in the field of pure speculation, she would not be justified in supposing, except upon perfectly sufficient grounds; because all such suppositions destroy the necessary completeness of speculationâ€a condition which the practical reason, however, does not consider to be requisite.", "In this sphere, therefore, Reason is mistress of a possession, her title to which she does not require to proveâ€which, in fact, she could not do.", "The burden of proof accordingly rests upon the opponent.", "But as he has just as little knowledge regarding the subject discussed, and is as little able to prove the non existence of the object of an idea, as the philosopher on the other side is to demonstrate its reality, it is evident that there is an advantage on the side of the philosopher who maintains his proposition as a practically necessary supposition (melior est conditio possidentis).", "For he is at liberty to employ, in self defence, the same weapons as his opponent makes use of in attacking him; that is, he has a right to use hypotheses not for the purpose of supporting the arguments in favour of his own propositions, but to show that his opponent knows no more than himself regarding the subject under discussion and cannot boast of any speculative advantage.", "Hypotheses are, therefore, admissible in the sphere of pure reason only as weapons for self defence, and not as supports to dogmatical assertions.", "But the opposing party we must always seek for in ourselves.", "For speculative reason is, in the sphere of transcendentalism, dialectical in its own nature.", "The difficulties and objections we have to fear lie in ourselves.", "They are like old but never superannuated claims; and we must seek them out, and settle them once and for ever, if we are to expect a permanent peace.", "External tranquility is hollow and unreal.", "The root of these contradictions, which lies in the nature of human reason, must be destroyed; and this can only be done by giving it, in the first instance, freedom to grow, nay, by nourishing it, that it may send out shoots, and thus betray its own existence.", "It is our duty, therefore, to try to discover new objections, to put weapons in the bands of our opponent, and to grant him the most favourable position in the arena that he can wish.", "We have nothing to fear from these concessions; on the contrary, we may rather hope that we shall thus make ourselves master of a possession which no one will ever venture to dispute.", "The thinker requires, to be fully equipped, the hypotheses of pure reason, which, although but leaden weapons (for they have not been steeled in the armoury of experience), are as useful as any that can be employed by his opponents.", "If, accordingly, we have assumed, from a non speculative point of view, the immaterial nature of the soul, and are met by the objection that experience seems to prove that the growth and decay of our mental faculties are mere modifications of the sensuous organismâ€we can weaken the force of this objection by the assumption that the body is nothing but the fundamental phenomenon, to which, as a necessary condition, all sensibility, and consequently all thought, relates in the present state of our existence; and that the separation of soul and body forms the conclusion of the sensuous exercise of our power of cognition and the beginning of the intellectual.", "The body would, in this view of the question, be regarded, not as the cause of thought, but merely as its restrictive condition, as promotive of the sensuous and animal, but as a hindrance to the pure and spiritual life; and the dependence of the animal life on the constitution of the body, would not prove that the whole life of man was also dependent on the state of the organism.", "We might go still farther, and discover new objections, or carry out to their extreme consequences those which have already been adduced.", "Generation, in the human race as well as among the irrational animals, depends on so many accidentsâ€of occasion, of proper sustenance, of the laws enacted by the government of a country of vice even, that it is difficult to believe in the eternal existence of a being whose life has begun under circumstances so mean and trivial, and so entirely dependent upon our own control.", "As regards the continuance of the existence of the whole race, we need have no difficulties, for accident in single cases is subject to general laws; but, in the case of each individual, it would seem as if we could hardly expect so wonderful an effect from causes so insignificant.", "But, in answer to these objections, we may adduce the transcendental hypothesis that all life is properly intelligible, and not subject to changes of time, and that it neither began in birth, nor will end in death.", "We may assume that this life is nothing more than a sensuous representation of pure spiritual life; that the whole world of sense is but an image, hovering before the faculty of cognition which we exercise in this sphere, and with no more objective reality than a dream; and that if we could intuite ourselves and other things as they really are, we should see ourselves in a world of spiritual natures, our connection with which did not begin at our birth and will not cease with the destruction of the body.", "And so on.", "We cannot be said to know what has been above asserted, nor do we seriously maintain the truth of these assertions; and the notions therein indicated are not even ideas of reason, they are purely fictitious conceptions.", "But this hypothetical procedure is in perfect conformity with the laws of reason.", "Our opponent mistakes the absence of empirical conditions for a proof of the complete impossibility of all that we have asserted; and we have to show him that he has not exhausted the whole sphere of possibility and that he can as little compass that sphere by the laws of experience and nature, as we can lay a secure foundation for the operations of reason beyond the region of experience.", "Such hypothetical defences against the pretensions of an opponent must not be regarded as declarations of opinion.", "The philosopher abandons them, so soon as the opposite party renounces its dogmatical conceit.", "To maintain a simply negative position in relation to propositions which rest on an insecure foundation, well befits the moderation of a true philosopher; but to uphold the objections urged against an opponent as proofs of the opposite statement is a proceeding just as unwarrantable and arrogant as it is to attack the position of a philosopher who advances affirmative propositions regarding such a subject.", "It is evident, therefore, that hypotheses, in the speculative sphere, are valid, not as independent propositions, but only relatively to opposite transcendent assumptions.", "For, to make the principles of possible experience conditions of the possibility of things in general is just as transcendent a procedure as to maintain the objective reality of ideas which can be applied to no objects except such as lie without the limits of possible experience.", "The judgements enounced by pure reason must be necessary, or they must not be enounced at all.", "Reason cannot trouble herself with opinions.", "But the hypotheses we have been discussing are merely problematical judgements, which can neither be confuted nor proved; while, therefore, they are not personal opinions, they are indispensable as answers to objections which are liable to be raised.", "But we must take care to confine them to this function, and guard against any assumption on their part of absolute validity, a proceeding which would involve reason in inextricable difficulties and contradictions.", "Section IV.", "The Discipline of Pure Reason in Relation to Proofs  It is a peculiarity, which distinguishes the proofs of transcendental synthetical propositions from those of all other Ã  priori synthetical cognitions, that reason, in the case of the former, does not apply its conceptions directly to an object, but is first obliged to prove, Ã  priori, the objective validity of these conceptions and the possibility of their syntheses.", "This is not merely a prudential rule, it is essential to the very possibility of the proof of a transcendental proposition.", "If I am required to pass, Ã  priori, beyond the conception of an object, I find that it is utterly impossible without the guidance of something which is not contained in the conception.", "In mathematics, it is Ã  priori intuition that guides my synthesis; and, in this case, all our conclusions may be drawn immediately from pure intuition.", "In transcendental cognition, so long as we are dealing only with conceptions of the understanding, we are guided by possible experience.", "That is to say, a proof in the sphere of transcendental cognition does not show that the given conception (that of an event, for example) leads directly to another conception (that of a cause)â€for this would be a saltus which nothing can justify; but it shows that experience itself, and consequently the object of experience, is impossible without the connection indicated by these conceptions.", "It follows that such a proof must demonstrate the possibility of arriving, synthetically and Ã  priori, at a certain knowledge of things, which was not contained in our conceptions of these things.", "Unless we pay particular attention to this requirement, our proofs, instead of pursuing the straight path indicated by reason, follow the tortuous road of mere subjective association.", "The illusory conviction, which rests upon subjective causes of association, and which is considered as resulting from the perception of a real and objective natural affinity, is always open to doubt and suspicion.", "For this reason, all the attempts which have been made to prove the principle of sufficient reason, have, according to the universal admission of philosophers, been quite unsuccessful; and, before the appearance of transcendental criticism, it was considered better, as this principle could not be abandoned, to appeal boldly to the common sense of mankind (a proceeding which always proves that the problem, which reason ought to solve, is one in which philosophers find great difficulties), rather than attempt to discover new dogmatical proofs.", "But, if the proposition to be proved is a proposition of pure reason, and if I aim at passing beyond my empirical conceptions by the aid of mere ideas, it is necessary that the proof should first show that such a step in synthesis is possible (which it is not), before it proceeds to prove the truth of the proposition itself.", "The so called proof of the simple nature of the soul from the unity of apperception, is a very plausible one.", "But it contains no answer to the objection, that, as the notion of absolute simplicity is not a conception which is directly applicable to a perception, but is an idea which must be inferredâ€if at allâ€from observation, it is by no means evident how the mere fact of consciousness, which is contained in all thought, although in so far a simple representation, can conduct me to the consciousness and cognition of a thing which is purely a thinking substance.", "When I represent to my mind the power of my body as in motion, my body in this thought is so far absolute unity, and my representation of it is a simple one; and hence I can indicate this representation by the motion of a point, because I have made abstraction of the size or volume of the body.", "But I cannot hence infer that, given merely the moving power of a body, the body may be cogitated as simple substance, merely because the representation in my mind takes no account of its content in space, and is consequently simple.", "The simple, in abstraction, is very different from the objectively simple; and hence the Ego, which is simple in the first sense, may, in the second sense, as indicating the soul itself, be a very complex conception, with a very various content.", "Thus it is evident that in all such arguments there lurks a paralogism.", "We guess (for without some such surmise our suspicion would not be excited in reference to a proof of this character) at the presence of the paralogism, by keeping ever before us a criterion of the possibility of those synthetical propositions which aim at proving more than experience can teach us.", "This criterion is obtained from the observation that such proofs do not lead us directly from the subject of the proposition to be proved to the required predicate, but find it necessary to presuppose the possibility of extending our cognition Ã  priori by means of ideas.", "We must, accordingly, always use the greatest caution; we require, before attempting any proof, to consider how it is possible to extend the sphere of cognition by the operations of pure reason, and from what source we are to derive knowledge, which is not obtained from the analysis of conceptions, nor relates, by anticipation, to possible experience.", "We shall thus spare ourselves much severe and fruitless labour, by not expecting from reason what is beyond its power, or rather by subjecting it to discipline, and teaching it to moderate its vehement desires for the extension of the sphere of cognition.", "The first rule for our guidance is, therefore, not to attempt a transcendental proof, before we have considered from what source we are to derive the principles upon which the proof is to be based, and what right we have to expect that our conclusions from these principles will be veracious.", "If they are principles of the understanding, it is vain to expect that we should attain by their means to ideas of pure reason; for these principles are valid only in regard to objects of possible experience.", "If they are principles of pure reason, our labour is alike in vain.", "For the principles of reason, if employed as objective, are without exception dialectical and possess no validity or truth, except as regulative principles of the systematic employment of reason in experience.", "But when such delusive proof are presented to us, it is our duty to meet them with the non liquet of a matured judgement; and, although we are unable to expose the particular sophism upon which the proof is based, we have a right to demand a deduction of the principles employed in it; and, if these principles have their origin in pure reason alone, such a deduction is absolutely impossible.", "And thus it is unnecessary that we should trouble ourselves with the exposure and confutation of every sophistical illusion; we may, at once, bring all dialectic, which is inexhaustible in the production of fallacies, before the bar of critical reason, which tests the principles upon which all dialectical procedure is based.", "The second peculiarity of transcendental proof is that a transcendental proposition cannot rest upon more than a single proof.", "If I am drawing conclusions, not from conceptions, but from intuition corresponding to a conception, be it pure intuition, as in mathematics, or empirical, as in natural science, the intuition which forms the basis of my inferences presents me with materials for many synthetical propositions, which I can connect in various modes, while, as it is allowable to proceed from different points in the intention, I can arrive by different paths at the same proposition.", "But every transcendental proposition sets out from a conception, and posits the synthetical condition of the possibility of an object according to this conception.", "There must, therefore, be but one ground of proof, because it is the conception alone which determines the object; and thus the proof cannot contain anything more than the determination of the object according to the conception.", "In our Transcendental Analytic, for example, we inferred the principle  Every event has a cause, from the only condition of the objective possibility of our conception of an event.", "This is that an event cannot be determined in time, and consequently cannot form a part of experience, unless it stands under this dynamical law.", "This is the only possible ground of proof; for our conception of an event possesses objective validity, that is, is a true conception, only because the law of causality determines an object to which it can refer.", "Other arguments in support of this principle have been attemptedâ€such as that from the contingent nature of a phenomenon; but when this argument is considered, we can discover no criterion of contingency, except the fact of an eventâ€of something happening, that is to say, the existence which is preceded by the non existence of an object, and thus we fall back on the very thing to be proved.", "If the proposition  â€œEvery thinking being is simple,â€ is to be proved, we keep to the conception of the ego, which is simple, and to which all thought has a relation.", "The same is the case with the transcendental proof of the existence of a Deity, which is based solely upon the harmony and reciprocal fitness of the conceptions of an ens realissimum and a necessary being, and cannot be attempted in any other manner.", "This caution serves to simplify very much the criticism of all propositions of reason.", "When reason employs conceptions alone, only one proof of its thesis is possible, if any.", "When, therefore, the dogmatist advances with ten arguments in favour of a proposition, we may be sure that not one of them is conclusive.", "For if he possessed one which proved the proposition he brings forward to demonstrationâ€as must always be the case with the propositions of pure reasonâ€what need is there for any more?", "His intention can only be similar to that of the advocate who had different arguments for different judges; this availing himself of the weakness of those who examine his arguments, who, without going into any profound investigation, adopt the view of the case which seems most probable at first sight and decide according to it.", "The third rule for the guidance of pure reason in the conduct of a proof is that all transcendental proofs must never be apagogic or indirect, but always ostensive or direct.", "The direct or ostensive proof not only establishes the truth of the proposition to be proved, but exposes the grounds of its truth; the apagogic, on the other hand, may assure us of the truth of the proposition, but it cannot enable us to comprehend the grounds of its possibility.", "The latter is, accordingly, rather an auxiliary to an argument, than a strictly philosophical and rational mode of procedure.", "In one respect, however, they have an advantage over direct proofs, from the fact that the mode of arguing by contradiction, which they employ, renders our understanding of the question more clear, and approximates the proof to the certainty of an intuitional demonstration.", "The true reason why indirect proofs are employed in different sciences is this.", "When the grounds upon which we seek to base a cognition are too various or too profound, we try whether or not we may not discover the truth of our cognition from its consequences.", "The modus ponens of reasoning from the truth of its inferences to the truth of a proposition would be admissible if all the inferences that can be drawn from it are known to be true; for in this case there can be only one possible ground for these inferences, and that is the true one.", "But this is a quite impracticable procedure, as it surpasses all our powers to discover all the possible inferences that can be drawn from a proposition.", "But this mode of reasoning is employed, under favour, when we wish to prove the truth of an hypothesis; in which case we admit the truth of the conclusionâ€which is supported by analogyâ€that, if all the inferences we have drawn and examined agree with the proposition assumed, all other possible inferences will also agree with it.", "But, in this way, an hypothesis can never be established as a demonstrated truth.", "The modus tollens of reasoning from known inferences to the unknown proposition, is not only a rigorous, but a very easy mode of proof.", "For, if it can be shown that but one inference from a proposition is false, then the proposition must itself be false.", "Instead, then, of examining, in an ostensive argument, the whole series of the grounds on which the truth of a proposition rests, we need only take the opposite of this proposition, and if one inference from it be false, then must the opposite be itself false; and, consequently, the proposition which we wished to prove must be true.", "The apagogic method of proof is admissible only in those sciences where it is impossible to mistake a subjective representation for an objective cognition.", "Where this is possible, it is plain that the opposite of a given proposition may contradict merely the subjective conditions of thought, and not the objective cognition; or it may happen that both propositions contradict each other only under a subjective condition, which is incorrectly considered to be objective, and, as the condition is itself false, both propositions may be false, and it will, consequently, be impossible to conclude the truth of the one from the falseness of the other.", "In mathematics such subreptions are impossible; and it is in this science, accordingly, that the indirect mode of proof has its true place.", "In the science of nature, where all assertion is based upon empirical intuition, such subreptions may be guarded against by the repeated comparison of observations; but this mode of proof is of little value in this sphere of knowledge.", "But the transcendental efforts of pure reason are all made in the sphere of the subjective, which is the real medium of all dialectical illusion; and thus reason endeavours, in its premisses, to impose upon us subjective representations for objective cognitions.", "In the transcendental sphere of pure reason, then, and in the case of synthetical propositions, it is inadmissible to support a statement by disproving the counter statement.", "For only two cases are possible; either, the counter statement is nothing but the enouncement of the inconsistency of the opposite opinion with the subjective conditions of reason, which does not affect the real case (for example, we cannot comprehend the unconditioned necessity of the existence of a being, and hence every speculative proof of the existence of such a being must be opposed on subjective grounds, while the possibility of this being in itself cannot with justice be denied); or, both propositions, being dialectical in their nature, are based upon an impossible conception.", "In this latter case the rule applies  non entis nulla sunt predicata; that is to say, what we affirm and what we deny, respecting such an object, are equally untrue, and the apagogic mode of arriving at the truth is in this case impossible.", "If, for example, we presuppose that the world of sense is given in itself in its totality, it is false, either that it is infinite, or that it is finite and limited in space.", "Both are false, because the hypothesis is false.", "For the notion of phenomena (as mere representations) which are given in themselves (as objects) is self contradictory; and the infinitude of this imaginary whole would, indeed, be unconditioned, but would be inconsistent (as everything in the phenomenal world is conditioned) with the unconditioned determination and finitude of quantities which is presupposed in our conception.", "The apagogic mode of proof is the true source of those illusions which have always had so strong an attraction for the admirers of dogmatical philosophy.", "It may be compared to a champion who maintains the honour and claims of the party he has adopted by offering battle to all who doubt the validity of these claims and the purity of that honour; while nothing can be proved in this way, except the respective strength of the combatants, and the advantage, in this respect, is always on the side of the attacking party.", "Spectators, observing that each party is alternately conqueror and conquered, are led to regard the subject of dispute as beyond the power of man to decide upon.", "But such an opinion cannot be justified; and it is sufficient to apply to these reasoners the remark   _Non defensoribus istis Tempus eget._   Each must try to establish his assertions by a transcendental deduction of the grounds of proof employed in his argument, and thus enable us to see in what way the claims of reason may be supported.", "If an opponent bases his assertions upon subjective grounds, he may be refuted with ease; not, however to the advantage of the dogmatist, who likewise depends upon subjective sources of cognition and is in like manner driven into a corner by his opponent.", "But, if parties employ the direct method of procedure, they will soon discover the difficulty, nay, the impossibility of proving their assertions, and will be forced to appeal to prescription and precedence; or they will, by the help of criticism, discover with ease the dogmatical illusions by which they had been mocked, and compel reason to renounce its exaggerated pretensions to speculative insight and to confine itself within the limits of its proper sphereâ€that of practical principles.", "Chapter II.", "The Canon of Pure Reason  It is a humiliating consideration for human reason that it is incompetent to discover truth by means of pure speculation, but, on the contrary, stands in need of discipline to check its deviations from the straight path and to expose the illusions which it originates.", "But, on the other hand, this consideration ought to elevate and to give it confidence, for this discipline is exercised by itself alone, and it is subject to the censure of no other power.", "The bounds, moreover, which it is forced to set to its speculative exercise, form likewise a check upon the fallacious pretensions of opponents; and thus what remains of its possessions, after these exaggerated claims have been disallowed, is secure from attack or usurpation.", "The greatest, and perhaps the only, use of all philosophy of pure reason is, accordingly, of a purely negative character.", "It is not an organon for the extension, but a discipline for the determination, of the limits of its exercise; and without laying claim to the discovery of new truth, it has the modest merit of guarding against error.", "At the same time, there must be some source of positive cognitions which belong to the domain of pure reason and which become the causes of error only from our mistaking their true character, while they form the goal towards which reason continually strives.", "How else can we account for the inextinguishable desire in the human mind to find a firm footing in some region beyond the limits of the world of experience?", "It hopes to attain to the possession of a knowledge in which it has the deepest interest.", "It enters upon the path of pure speculation; but in vain.", "We have some reason, however, to expect that, in the only other way that lies open to itâ€the path of practical reasonâ€it may meet with better success.", "I understand by a canon a list of the Ã  priori principles of the proper employment of certain faculties of cognition.", "Thus general logic, in its analytical department, is a formal canon for the faculties of understanding and reason.", "In the same way, Transcendental Analytic was seen to be a canon of the pure understanding; for it alone is competent to enounce true Ã  priori synthetical cognitions.", "But, when no proper employment of a faculty of cognition is possible, no canon can exist.", "But the synthetical cognition of pure speculative reason is, as has been shown, completely impossible.", "There cannot, therefore, exist any canon for the speculative exercise of this facultyâ€for its speculative exercise is entirely dialectical; and, consequently, transcendental logic, in this respect, is merely a discipline, and not a canon.", "If, then, there is any proper mode of employing the faculty of pure reasonâ€in which case there must be a canon for this facultyâ€this canon will relate, not to the speculative, but to the practical use of reason.", "This canon we now proceed to investigate.", "Section I. Of the Ultimate End of the Pure Use of Reason  There exists in the faculty of reason a natural desire to venture beyond the field of experience, to attempt to reach the utmost bounds of all cognition by the help of ideas alone, and not to rest satisfied until it has fulfilled its course and raised the sum of its cognitions into a self subsistent systematic whole.", "Is the motive for this endeavour to be found in its speculative, or in its practical interests alone?", "Setting aside, at present, the results of the labours of pure reason in its speculative exercise, I shall merely inquire regarding the problems the solution of which forms its ultimate aim, whether reached or not, and in relation to which all other aims are but partial and intermediate.", "These highest aims must, from the nature of reason, possess complete unity; otherwise the highest interest of humanity could not be successfully promoted.", "The transcendental speculation of reason relates to three things  the freedom of the will, the immortality of the soul, and the existence of God.", "The speculative interest which reason has in those questions is very small; and, for its sake alone, we should not undertake the labour of transcendental investigationâ€a labour full of toil and ceaseless struggle.", "We should be loth to undertake this labour, because the discoveries we might make would not be of the smallest use in the sphere of concrete or physical investigation.", "We may find out that the will is free, but this knowledge only relates to the intelligible cause of our volition.", "As regards the phenomena or expressions of this will, that is, our actions, we are bound, in obedience to an inviolable maxim, without which reason cannot be employed in the sphere of experience, to explain these in the same way as we explain all the other phenomena of nature, that is to say, according to its unchangeable laws.", "We may have discovered the spirituality and immortality of the soul, but we cannot employ this knowledge to explain the phenomena of this life, nor the peculiar nature of the future, because our conception of an incorporeal nature is purely negative and does not add anything to our knowledge, and the only inferences to be drawn from it are purely fictitious.", "If, again, we prove the existence of a supreme intelligence, we should be able from it to make the conformity to aims existing in the arrangement of the world comprehensible; but we should not be justified in deducing from it any particular arrangement or disposition, or inferring any where it is not perceived.", "For it is a necessary rule of the speculative use of reason that we must not overlook natural causes, or refuse to listen to the teaching of experience, for the sake of deducing what we know and perceive from something that transcends all our knowledge.", "In one word, these three propositions are, for the speculative reason, always transcendent, and cannot be employed as immanent principles in relation to the objects of experience; they are, consequently, of no use to us in this sphere, being but the valueless results of the severe but unprofitable efforts of reason.", "If, then, the actual cognition of these three cardinal propositions is perfectly useless, while Reason uses her utmost endeavours to induce us to admit them, it is plain that their real value and importance relate to our practical, and not to our speculative interest.", "I term all that is possible through free will, practical.", "But if the conditions of the exercise of free volition are empirical, reason can have only a regulative, and not a constitutive, influence upon it, and is serviceable merely for the introduction of unity into its empirical laws.", "In the moral philosophy of prudence, for example, the sole business of reason is to bring about a union of all the ends, which are aimed at by our inclinations, into one ultimate endâ€that of happinessâ€and to show the agreement which should exist among the means of attaining that end.", "In this sphere, accordingly, reason cannot present to us any other than pragmatical laws of free action, for our guidance towards the aims set up by the senses, and is incompetent to give us laws which are pure and determined completely Ã  priori.", "On the other hand, pure practical laws, the ends of which have been given by reason entirely Ã  priori, and which are not empirically conditioned, but are, on the contrary, absolutely imperative in their nature, would be products of pure reason.", "Such are the moral laws; and these alone belong to the sphere of the practical exercise of reason, and admit of a canon.", "All the powers of reason, in the sphere of what may be termed pure philosophy, are, in fact, directed to the three above mentioned problems alone.", "These again have a still higher endâ€the answer to the question, what we ought to do, if the will is free, if there is a God and a future world.", "Now, as this problem relates to our in reference to the highest aim of humanity, it is evident that the ultimate intention of nature, in the constitution of our reason, has been directed to the moral alone.", "We must take care, however, in turning our attention to an object which is foreign[78] to the sphere of transcendental philosophy, not to injure the unity of our system by digressions, nor, on the other hand, to fail in clearness, by saying too little on the new subject of discussion.", "I hope to avoid both extremes, by keeping as close as possible to the transcendental, and excluding all psychological, that is, empirical, elements.", "[78] All practical conceptions relate to objects of pleasure and pain,  and consequentlyâ€in an indirect manner, at leastâ€to objects of  feeling.", "But as feeling is not a faculty of representation, but lies  out of the sphere of our powers of cognition, the elements of our  judgements, in so far as they relate to pleasure or pain, that is, the  elements of our practical judgements, do not belong to transcendental  philosophy, which has to do with pure Ã  priori cognitions alone.", "I have to remark, in the first place, that at present I treat of the conception of freedom in the practical sense only, and set aside the corresponding transcendental conception, which cannot be employed as a ground of explanation in the phenomenal world, but is itself a problem for pure reason.", "A will is purely animal (arbitrium brutum) when it is determined by sensuous impulses or instincts only, that is, when it is determined in a pathological manner.", "A will, which can be determined independently of sensuous impulses, consequently by motives presented by reason alone, is called a free will (arbitrium liberum); and everything which is connected with this free will, either as principle or consequence, is termed practical.", "The existence of practical freedom can be proved from experience alone.", "For the human will is not determined by that alone which immediately affects the senses; on the contrary, we have the power, by calling up the notion of what is useful or hurtful in a more distant relation, of overcoming the immediate impressions on our sensuous faculty of desire.", "But these considerations of what is desirable in relation to our whole state, that is, is in the end good and useful, are based entirely upon reason.", "This faculty, accordingly, enounces laws, which are imperative or objective laws of freedom and which tell us what ought to take place, thus distinguishing themselves from the laws of nature, which relate to that which does take place.", "The laws of freedom or of free will are hence termed practical laws.", "Whether reason is not itself, in the actual delivery of these laws, determined in its turn by other influences, and whether the action which, in relation to sensuous impulses, we call free, may not, in relation to higher and more remote operative causes, really form a part of natureâ€these are questions which do not here concern us.", "They are purely speculative questions; and all we have to do, in the practical sphere, is to inquire into the rule of conduct which reason has to present.", "Experience demonstrates to us the existence of practical freedom as one of the causes which exist in nature, that is, it shows the causal power of reason in the determination of the will.", "The idea of transcendental freedom, on the contrary, requires that reasonâ€in relation to its causal power of commencing a series of phenomenaâ€should be independent of all sensuous determining causes; and thus it seems to be in opposition to the law of nature and to all possible experience.", "It therefore remains a problem for the human mind.", "But this problem does not concern reason in its practical use; and we have, therefore, in a canon of pure reason, to do with only two questions, which relate to the practical interest of pure reason  Is there a God?", "and, Is there a future life?", "The question of transcendental freedom is purely speculative, and we may therefore set it entirely aside when we come to treat of practical reason.", "Besides, we have already discussed this subject in the antinomy of pure reason.", "Section II.", "Of the Ideal of the Summum Bonum as a Determining Ground of the Ultimate End of Pure Reason  Reason conducted us, in its speculative use, through the field of experience and, as it can never find complete satisfaction in that sphere, from thence to speculative ideasâ€which, however, in the end brought us back again to experience, and thus fulfilled the purpose of reason, in a manner which, though useful, was not at all in accordance with our expectations.", "It now remains for us to consider whether pure reason can be employed in a practical sphere, and whether it will here conduct us to those ideas which attain the highest ends of pure reason, as we have just stated them.", "We shall thus ascertain whether, from the point of view of its practical interest, reason may not be able to supply us with that which, on the speculative side, it wholly denies us.", "The whole interest of reason, speculative as well as practical, is centred in the three following questions   1.", "WHAT CAN I KNOW?", "2.", "WHAT OUGHT I TO DO?", "3.", "WHAT MAY I HOPE?", "The first question is purely speculative.", "We have, as I flatter myself, exhausted all the replies of which it is susceptible, and have at last found the reply with which reason must content itself, and with which it ought to be content, so long as it pays no regard to the practical.", "But from the two great ends to the attainment of which all these efforts of pure reason were in fact directed, we remain just as far removed as if we had consulted our ease and declined the task at the outset.", "So far, then, as knowledge is concerned, thus much, at least, is established, that, in regard to those two problems, it lies beyond our reach.", "The second question is purely practical.", "As such it may indeed fall within the province of pure reason, but still it is not transcendental, but moral, and consequently cannot in itself form the subject of our criticism.", "The third question  If I act as I ought to do, what may I then hope?â€is at once practical and theoretical.", "The practical forms a clue to the answer of the theoretical, andâ€in its highest formâ€speculative question.", "For all hoping has happiness for its object and stands in precisely the same relation to the practical and the law of morality as knowing to the theoretical cognition of things and the law of nature.", "The former arrives finally at the conclusion that something is (which determines the ultimate end), because something ought to take place; the latter, that something is (which operates as the highest cause), because something does take place.", "Happiness is the satisfaction of all our desires; extensive, in regard to their multiplicity; intensive, in regard to their degree; and protensive, in regard to their duration.", "The practical law based on the motive of happiness I term a pragmatical law (or prudential rule); but that law, assuming such to exist, which has no other motive than the worthiness of being happy, I term a moral or ethical law.", "The first tells us what we have to do, if we wish to become possessed of happiness; the second dictates how we ought to act, in order to deserve happiness.", "The first is based upon empirical principles; for it is only by experience that I can learn either what inclinations exist which desire satisfaction, or what are the natural means of satisfying them.", "The second takes no account of our desires or the means of satisfying them, and regards only the freedom of a rational being, and the necessary conditions under which alone this freedom can harmonize with the distribution of happiness according to principles.", "This second law may therefore rest upon mere ideas of pure reason, and may be cognized Ã  priori.", "I assume that there are pure moral laws which determine, entirely Ã  priori (without regard to empirical motives, that is, to happiness), the conduct of a rational being, or in other words, to use which it makes of its freedom, and that these laws are absolutely imperative (not merely hypothetically, on the supposition of other empirical ends), and therefore in all respects necessary.", "I am warranted in assuming this, not only by the arguments of the most enlightened moralists, but by the moral judgement of every man who will make the attempt to form a distinct conception of such a law.", "Pure reason, then, contains, not indeed in its speculative, but in its practical, or, more strictly, its moral use, principles of the possibility of experience, of such actions, namely, as, in accordance with ethical precepts, might be met with in the history of man.", "For since reason commands that such actions should take place, it must be possible for them to take place; and hence a particular kind of systematic unityâ€the moralâ€must be possible.", "We have found, it is true, that the systematic unity of nature could not be established according to speculative principles of reason, because, while reason possesses a causal power in relation to freedom, it has none in relation to the whole sphere of nature; and, while moral principles of reason can produce free actions, they cannot produce natural laws.", "It is, then, in its practical, but especially in its moral use, that the principles of pure reason possess objective reality.", "I call the world a moral world, in so far as it may be in accordance with all the ethical lawsâ€which, by virtue of the freedom of reasonable beings, it can be, and according to the necessary laws of morality it ought to be.", "But this world must be conceived only as an intelligible world, inasmuch as abstraction is therein made of all conditions (ends), and even of all impediments to morality (the weakness or pravity of human nature).", "So far, then, it is a mere ideaâ€though still a practical ideaâ€which may have, and ought to have, an influence on the world of sense, so as to bring it as far as possible into conformity with itself.", "The idea of a moral world has, therefore, objective reality, not as referring to an object of intelligible intuitionâ€for of such an object we can form no conception whateverâ€but to the world of senseâ€conceived, however, as an object of pure reason in its practical useâ€and to a corpus mysticum of rational beings in it, in so far as the liberum arbitrium of the individual is placed, under and by virtue of moral laws, in complete systematic unity both with itself and with the freedom of all others.", "That is the answer to the first of the two questions of pure reason which relate to its practical interest  Do that which will render thee worthy of happiness.", "The second question is this  If I conduct myself so as not to be unworthy of happiness, may I hope thereby to obtain happiness?", "In order to arrive at the solution of this question, we must inquire whether the principles of pure reason, which prescribe Ã  priori the law, necessarily also connect this hope with it.", "I say, then, that just as the moral principles are necessary according to reason in its practical use, so it is equally necessary according to reason in its theoretical use to assume that every one has ground to hope for happiness in the measure in which he has made himself worthy of it in his conduct, and that therefore the system of morality is inseparably (though only in the idea of pure reason) connected with that of happiness.", "Now in an intelligible, that is, in the moral world, in the conception of which we make abstraction of all the impediments to morality (sensuous desires), such a system of happiness, connected with and proportioned to morality, may be conceived as necessary, because freedom of volitionâ€partly incited, and partly restrained by moral lawsâ€would be itself the cause of general happiness; and thus rational beings, under the guidance of such principles, would be themselves the authors both of their own enduring welfare and that of others.", "But such a system of self rewarding morality is only an idea, the carrying out of which depends upon the condition that every one acts as he ought; in other words, that all actions of reasonable beings be such as they would be if they sprung from a Supreme Will, comprehending in, or under, itself all particular wills.", "But since the moral law is binding on each individual in the use of his freedom of volition, even if others should not act in conformity with this law, neither the nature of things, nor the causality of actions and their relation to morality, determine how the consequences of these actions will be related to happiness; and the necessary connection of the hope of happiness with the unceasing endeavour to become worthy of happiness, cannot be cognized by reason, if we take nature alone for our guide.", "This connection can be hoped for only on the assumption that the cause of nature is a supreme reason, which governs according to moral laws.", "I term the idea of an intelligence in which the morally most perfect will, united with supreme blessedness, is the cause of all happiness in the world, so far as happiness stands in strict relation to morality (as the worthiness of being happy), the ideal of the supreme Good.", "It is only, then, in the ideal of the supreme original good, that pure reason can find the ground of the practically necessary connection of both elements of the highest derivative good, and accordingly of an intelligible, that is, moral world.", "Now since we are necessitated by reason to conceive ourselves as belonging to such a world, while the senses present to us nothing but a world of phenomena, we must assume the former as a consequence of our conduct in the world of sense (since the world of sense gives us no hint of it), and therefore as future in relation to us.", "Thus God and a future life are two hypotheses which, according to the principles of pure reason, are inseparable from the obligation which this reason imposes upon us.", "Morality per se constitutes a system.", "But we can form no system of happiness, except in so far as it is dispensed in strict proportion to morality.", "But this is only possible in the intelligible world, under a wise author and ruler.", "Such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must look upon as future, reason finds itself compelled to assume; or it must regard the moral laws as idle dreams, since the necessary consequence which this same reason connects with them must, without this hypothesis, fall to the ground.", "Hence also the moral laws are universally regarded as commands, which they could not be did they not connect Ã  priori adequate consequences with their dictates, and thus carry with them promises and threats.", "But this, again, they could not do, did they not reside in a necessary being, as the Supreme Good, which alone can render such a teleological unity possible.", "Leibnitz termed the world, when viewed in relation to the rational beings which it contains, and the moral relations in which they stand to each other, under the government of the Supreme Good, the kingdom of Grace, and distinguished it from the kingdom of Nature, in which these rational beings live, under moral laws, indeed, but expect no other consequences from their actions than such as follow according to the course of nature in the world of sense.", "To view ourselves, therefore, as in the kingdom of grace, in which all happiness awaits us, except in so far as we ourselves limit our participation in it by actions which render us unworthy of happiness, is a practically necessary idea of reason.", "Practical laws, in so far as they are subjective grounds of actions, that is, subjective principles, are termed maxims.", "The judgements of moral according to in its purity and ultimate results are framed according ideas; the observance of its laws, according to according to maxims.", "The whole course of our life must be subject to moral maxims; but this is impossible, unless with the moral law, which is a mere idea, reason connects an efficient cause which ordains to all conduct which is in conformity with the moral law an issue either in this or in another life, which is in exact conformity with our highest aims.", "Thus, without a God and without a world, invisible to us now, but hoped for, the glorious ideas of morality are, indeed, objects of approbation and of admiration, but cannot be the springs of purpose and action.", "For they do not satisfy all the aims which are natural to every rational being, and which are determined Ã  priori by pure reason itself, and necessary.", "Happiness alone is, in the view of reason, far from being the complete good.", "Reason does not approve of it (however much inclination may desire it), except as united with desert.", "On the other hand, morality alone, and with it, mere desert, is likewise far from being the complete good.", "To make it complete, he who conducts himself in a manner not unworthy of happiness, must be able to hope for the possession of happiness.", "Even reason, unbiased by private ends, or interested considerations, cannot judge otherwise, if it puts itself in the place of a being whose business it is to dispense all happiness to others.", "For in the practical idea both points are essentially combined, though in such a way that participation in happiness is rendered possible by the moral disposition, as its condition, and not conversely, the moral disposition by the prospect of happiness.", "For a disposition which should require the prospect of happiness as its necessary condition would not be moral, and hence also would not be worthy of complete happinessâ€a happiness which, in the view of reason, recognizes no limitation but such as arises from our own immoral conduct.", "Happiness, therefore, in exact proportion with the morality of rational beings (whereby they are made worthy of happiness), constitutes alone the supreme good of a world into which we absolutely must transport ourselves according to the commands of pure but practical reason.", "This world is, it is true, only an intelligible world; for of such a systematic unity of ends as it requires, the world of sense gives us no hint.", "Its reality can be based on nothing else but the hypothesis of a supreme original good.", "In it independent reason, equipped with all the sufficiency of a supreme cause, founds, maintains, and fulfils the universal order of things, with the most perfect teleological harmony, however much this order may be hidden from us in the world of sense.", "This moral theology has the peculiar advantage, in contrast with speculative theology, of leading inevitably to the conception of a sole, perfect, and rational First Cause, whereof speculative theology does not give us any indication on objective grounds, far less any convincing evidence.", "For we find neither in transcendental nor in natural theology, however far reason may lead us in these, any ground to warrant us in assuming the existence of one only Being, which stands at the head of all natural causes, and on which these are entirely dependent.", "On the other band, if we take our stand on moral unity as a necessary law of the universe, and from this point of view consider what is necessary to give this law adequate efficiency and, for us, obligatory force, we must come to the conclusion that there is one only supreme will, which comprehends all these laws in itself.", "For how, under different wills, should we find complete unity of ends?", "This will must be omnipotent, that all nature and its relation to morality in the world may be subject to it; omniscient, that it may have knowledge of the most secret feelings and their moral worth; omnipresent, that it may be at hand to supply every necessity to which the highest weal of the world may give rise; eternal, that this harmony of nature and liberty may never fail; and so on.", "But this systematic unity of ends in this world of intelligencesâ€which, as mere nature, is only a world of sense, but, as a system of freedom of volition, may be termed an intelligible, that is, moral world (regnum gratiae)â€leads inevitably also to the teleological unity of all things which constitute this great whole, according to universal natural lawsâ€just as the unity of the former is according to universal and necessary moral lawsâ€and unites the practical with the speculative reason.", "The world must be represented as having originated from an idea, if it is to harmonize with that use of reason without which we cannot even consider ourselves as worthy of reasonâ€namely, the moral use, which rests entirely on the idea of the supreme good.", "Hence the investigation of nature receives a teleological direction, and becomes, in its widest extension, physico theology.", "But this, taking its rise in moral order as a unity founded on the essence of freedom, and not accidentally instituted by external commands, establishes the teleological view of nature on grounds which must be inseparably connected with the internal possibility of things.", "This gives rise to a transcendental theology, which takes the ideal of the highest ontological perfection as a principle of systematic unity; and this principle connects all things according to universal and necessary natural laws, because all things have their origin in the absolute necessity of the one only Primal Being.", "What use can we make of our understanding, even in respect of experience, if we do not propose ends to ourselves?", "But the highest ends are those of morality, and it is only pure reason that can give us the knowledge of these.", "Though supplied with these, and putting ourselves under their guidance, we can make no teleological use of the knowledge of nature, as regards cognition, unless nature itself has established teleological unity.", "For without this unity we should not even possess reason, because we should have no school for reason, and no cultivation through objects which afford the materials for its conceptions.", "But teleological unity is a necessary unity, and founded on the essence of the individual will itself.", "Hence this will, which is the condition of the application of this unity in concreto, must be so likewise.", "In this way the transcendental enlargement of our rational cognition would be, not the cause, but merely the effect of the practical teleology which pure reason imposes upon us.", "Hence, also, we find in the history of human reason that, before the moral conceptions were sufficiently purified and determined, and before men had attained to a perception of the systematic unity of ends according to these conceptions and from necessary principles, the knowledge of nature, and even a considerable amount of intellectual culture in many other sciences, could produce only rude and vague conceptions of the Deity, sometimes even admitting of an astonishing indifference with regard to this question altogether.", "But the more enlarged treatment of moral ideas, which was rendered necessary by the extreme pure moral law of our religion, awakened the interest, and thereby quickened the perceptions of reason in relation to this object.", "In this way, and without the help either of an extended acquaintance with nature, or of a reliable transcendental insight (for these have been wanting in all ages), a conception of the Divine Being was arrived at, which we now bold to be the correct one, not because speculative reason convinces us of its correctness, but because it accords with the moral principles of reason.", "Thus it is to pure reason, but only in its practical use, that we must ascribe the merit of having connected with our highest interest a cognition, of which mere speculation was able only to form a conjecture, but the validity of which it was unable to establishâ€and of having thereby rendered it, not indeed a demonstrated dogma, but a hypothesis absolutely necessary to the essential ends of reason.", "But if practical reason has reached this elevation, and has attained to the conception of a sole Primal Being as the supreme good, it must not, therefore, imagine that it has transcended the empirical conditions of its application, and risen to the immediate cognition of new objects; it must not presume to start from the conception which it has gained, and to deduce from it the moral laws themselves.", "For it was these very laws, the internal practical necessity of which led us to the hypothesis of an independent cause, or of a wise ruler of the universe, who should give them effect.", "Hence we are not entitled to regard them as accidental and derived from the mere will of the ruler, especially as we have no conception of such a will, except as formed in accordance with these laws.", "So far, then, as practical reason has the right to conduct us, we shall not look upon actions as binding on us, because they are the commands of God, but we shall regard them as divine commands, because we are internally bound by them.", "We shall study freedom under the teleological unity which accords with principles of reason; we shall look upon ourselves as acting in conformity with the divine will only in so far as we hold sacred the moral law which reason teaches us from the nature of actions themselves, and we shall believe that we can obey that will only by promoting the weal of the universe in ourselves and in others.", "Moral theology is, therefore, only of immanent use.", "It teaches us to fulfil our destiny here in the world, by placing ourselves in harmony with the general system of ends, and warns us against the fanaticism, nay, the crime of depriving reason of its legislative authority in the moral conduct of life, for the purpose of directly connecting this authority with the idea of the Supreme Being.", "For this would be, not an immanent, but a transcendent use of moral theology, and, like the transcendent use of mere speculation, would inevitably pervert and frustrate the ultimate ends of reason.", "Section III.", "Of Opinion, Knowledge, and Belief  The holding of a thing to be true is a phenomenon in our understanding which may rest on objective grounds, but requires, also, subjective causes in the mind of the person judging.", "If a judgement is valid for every rational being, then its ground is objectively sufficient, and it is termed a conviction.", "If, on the other hand, it has its ground in the particular character of the subject, it is termed a persuasion.", "Persuasion is a mere illusion, the ground of the judgement, which lies solely in the subject, being regarded as objective.", "Hence a judgement of this kind has only private validityâ€is only valid for the individual who judges, and the holding of a thing to be true in this way cannot be communicated.", "But truth depends upon agreement with the object, and consequently the judgements of all understandings, if true, must be in agreement with each other (consentientia uni tertio consentiunt inter se).", "Conviction may, therefore, be distinguished, from an external point of view, from persuasion, by the possibility of communicating it and by showing its validity for the reason of every man; for in this case the presumption, at least, arises that the agreement of all judgements with each other, in spite of the different characters of individuals, rests upon the common ground of the agreement of each with the object, and thus the correctness of the judgement is established.", "Persuasion, accordingly, cannot be subjectively distinguished from conviction, that is, so long as the subject views its judgement simply as a phenomenon of its own mind.", "But if we inquire whether the grounds of our judgement, which are valid for us, produce the same effect on the reason of others as on our own, we have then the means, though only subjective means, not, indeed, of producing conviction, but of detecting the merely private validity of the judgement; in other words, of discovering that there is in it the element of mere persuasion.", "If we can, in addition to this, develop the subjective causes of the judgement, which we have taken for its objective grounds, and thus explain the deceptive judgement as a phenomenon in our mind, apart altogether from the objective character of the object, we can then expose the illusion and need be no longer deceived by it, although, if its subjective cause lies in our nature, we cannot hope altogether to escape its influence.", "I can only maintain, that is, affirm as necessarily valid for every one, that which produces conviction.", "Persuasion I may keep for myself, if it is agreeable to me; but I cannot, and ought not, to attempt to impose it as binding upon others.", "Holding for true, or the subjective validity of a judgement in relation to conviction (which is, at the same time, objectively valid), has the three following degrees  opinion, belief, and knowledge.", "Opinion is a consciously insufficient judgement, subjectively as well as objectively.", "Belief is subjectively sufficient, but is recognized as being objectively insufficient.", "Knowledge is both subjectively and objectively sufficient.", "Subjective sufficiency is termed conviction (for myself); objective sufficiency is termed certainty (for all).", "I need not dwell longer on the explanation of such simple conceptions.", "I must never venture to be of opinion, without knowing something, at least, by which my judgement, in itself merely problematical, is brought into connection with the truthâ€which connection, although not perfect, is still something more than an arbitrary fiction.", "Moreover, the law of such a connection must be certain.", "For if, in relation to this law, I have nothing more than opinion, my judgement is but a play of the imagination, without the least relation to truth.", "In the judgements of pure reason, opinion has no place.", "For, as they do not rest on empirical grounds and as the sphere of pure reason is that of necessary truth and Ã  priori cognition, the principle of connection in it requires universality and necessity, and consequently perfect certaintyâ€otherwise we should have no guide to the truth at all.", "Hence it is absurd to have an opinion in pure mathematics; we must know, or abstain from forming a judgement altogether.", "The case is the same with the maxims of morality.", "For we must not hazard an action on the mere opinion that it is allowed, but we must know it to be so.", "In the transcendental sphere of reason, on the other hand, the term opinion is too weak, while the word knowledge is too strong.", "From the merely speculative point of view, therefore, we cannot form a judgement at all.", "For the subjective grounds of a judgement, such as produce belief, cannot be admitted in speculative inquiries, inasmuch as they cannot stand without empirical support and are incapable of being communicated to others in equal measure.", "But it is only from the practical point of view that a theoretically insufficient judgement can be termed belief.", "Now the practical reference is either to skill or to morality; to the former, when the end proposed is arbitrary and accidental, to the latter, when it is absolutely necessary.", "If we propose to ourselves any end whatever, the conditions of its attainment are hypothetically necessary.", "The necessity is subjectively, but still only comparatively, sufficient, if I am acquainted with no other conditions under which the end can be attained.", "On the other hand, it is sufficient, absolutely and for every one, if I know for certain that no one can be acquainted with any other conditions under which the attainment of the proposed end would be possible.", "In the former case my suppositionâ€my judgement with regard to certain conditionsâ€is a merely accidental belief; in the latter it is a necessary belief.", "The physician must pursue some course in the case of a patient who is in danger, but is ignorant of the nature of the disease.", "He observes the symptoms, and concludes, according to the best of his judgement, that it is a case of phthisis.", "His belief is, even in his own judgement, only contingent  another man might, perhaps come nearer the truth.", "Such a belief, contingent indeed, but still forming the ground of the actual use of means for the attainment of certain ends, I term Pragmatical belief.", "The usual test, whether that which any one maintains is merely his persuasion, or his subjective conviction at least, that is, his firm belief, is a bet.", "It frequently happens that a man delivers his opinions with so much boldness and assurance, that he appears to be under no apprehension as to the possibility of his being in error.", "The offer of a bet startles him, and makes him pause.", "Sometimes it turns out that his persuasion may be valued at a ducat, but not at ten.", "For he does not hesitate, perhaps, to venture a ducat, but if it is proposed to stake ten, he immediately becomes aware of the possibility of his being mistakenâ€a possibility which has hitherto escaped his observation.", "If we imagine to ourselves that we have to stake the happiness of our whole life on the truth of any proposition, our judgement drops its air of triumph, we take the alarm, and discover the actual strength of our belief.", "Thus pragmatical belief has degrees, varying in proportion to the interests at stake.", "Now, in cases where we cannot enter upon any course of action in reference to some object, and where, accordingly, our judgement is purely theoretical, we can still represent to ourselves, in thought, the possibility of a course of action, for which we suppose that we have sufficient grounds, if any means existed of ascertaining the truth of the matter.", "Thus we find in purely theoretical judgements an analogon of practical judgements, to which the word belief may properly be applied, and which we may term doctrinal belief.", "I should not hesitate to stake my all on the truth of the propositionâ€if there were any possibility of bringing it to the test of experienceâ€that, at least, some one of the planets, which we see, is inhabited.", "Hence I say that I have not merely the opinion, but the strong belief, on the correctness of which I would stake even many of the advantages of life, that there are inhabitants in other worlds.", "Now we must admit that the doctrine of the existence of God belongs to doctrinal belief.", "For, although in respect to the theoretical cognition of the universe I do not require to form any theory which necessarily involves this idea, as the condition of my explanation of the phenomena which the universe presents, but, on the contrary, am rather bound so to use my reason as if everything were mere nature, still teleological unity is so important a condition of the application of my reason to nature, that it is impossible for me to ignore itâ€especially since, in addition to these considerations, abundant examples of it are supplied by experience.", "But the sole condition, so far as my knowledge extends, under which this unity can be my guide in the investigation of nature, is the assumption that a supreme intelligence has ordered all things according to the wisest ends.", "Consequently, the hypothesis of a wise author of the universe is necessary for my guidance in the investigation of natureâ€is the condition under which alone I can fulfil an end which is contingent indeed, but by no means unimportant.", "Moreover, since the result of my attempts so frequently confirms the utility of this assumption, and since nothing decisive can be adduced against it, it follows that it would be saying far too little to term my judgement, in this case, a mere opinion, and that, even in this theoretical connection, I may assert that I firmly believe in God.", "Still, if we use words strictly, this must not be called a practical, but a doctrinal belief, which the theology of nature (physico theology) must also produce in my mind.", "In the wisdom of a Supreme Being, and in the shortness of life, so inadequate to the development of the glorious powers of human nature, we may find equally sufficient grounds for a doctrinal belief in the future life of the human soul.", "The expression of belief is, in such cases, an expression of modesty from the objective point of view, but, at the same time, of firm confidence, from the subjective.", "If I should venture to term this merely theoretical judgement even so much as a hypothesis which I am entitled to assume; a more complete conception, with regard to another world and to the cause of the world, might then be justly required of me than I am, in reality, able to give.", "For, if I assume anything, even as a mere hypothesis, I must, at least, know so much of the properties of such a being as will enable me, not to form the conception, but to imagine the existence of it.", "But the word belief refers only to the guidance which an idea gives me, and to its subjective influence on the conduct of my reason, which forces me to hold it fast, though I may not be in a position to give a speculative account of it.", "But mere doctrinal belief is, to some extent, wanting in stability.", "We often quit our hold of it, in consequence of the difficulties which occur in speculation, though in the end we inevitably return to it again.", "It is quite otherwise with moral belief.", "For in this sphere action is absolutely necessary, that is, I must act in obedience to the moral law in all points.", "The end is here incontrovertibly established, and there is only one condition possible, according to the best of my perception, under which this end can harmonize with all other ends, and so have practical validityâ€namely, the existence of a God and of a future world.", "I know also, to a certainty, that no one can be acquainted with any other conditions which conduct to the same unity of ends under the moral law.", "But since the moral precept is, at the same time, my maxim (as reason requires that it should be), I am irresistibly constrained to believe in the existence of God and in a future life; and I am sure that nothing can make me waver in this belief, since I should thereby overthrow my moral maxims, the renunciation of which would render me hateful in my own eyes.", "Thus, while all the ambitious attempts of reason to penetrate beyond the limits of experience end in disappointment, there is still enough left to satisfy us in a practical point of view.", "No one, it is true, will be able to boast that he knows that there is a God and a future life; for, if he knows this, he is just the man whom I have long wished to find.", "All knowledge, regarding an object of mere reason, can be communicated; and I should thus be enabled to hope that my own knowledge would receive this wonderful extension, through the instrumentality of his instruction.", "No, my conviction is not logical, but moral certainty; and since it rests on subjective grounds (of the moral sentiment), I must not even say  It is morally certain that there is a God, etc., but  I am morally certain, that is, my belief in God and in another world is so interwoven with my moral nature that I am under as little apprehension of having the former torn from me as of losing the latter.", "The only point in this argument that may appear open to suspicion is that this rational belief presupposes the existence of moral sentiments.", "If we give up this assumption, and take a man who is entirely indifferent with regard to moral laws, the question which reason proposes, becomes then merely a problem for speculation and may, indeed, be supported by strong grounds from analogy, but not by such as will compel the most obstinate scepticism to give way.", "[79] But in these questions no man is free from all interest.", "For though the want of good sentiments may place him beyond the influence of moral interests, still even in this case enough may be left to make him fear the existence of God and a future life.", "For he cannot pretend to any certainty of the non existence of God and of a future life, unlessâ€since it could only be proved by mere reason, and therefore apodeicticallyâ€he is prepared to establish the impossibility of both, which certainly no reasonable man would undertake to do.", "This would be a negative belief, which could not, indeed, produce morality and good sentiments, but still could produce an analogon of these, by operating as a powerful restraint on the outbreak of evil dispositions.", "[79] The human mind (as, I believe, every rational being must of  necessity do) takes a natural interest in morality, although this  interest is not undivided, and may not be practically in  preponderance.", "If you strengthen and increase it, you will find the  reason become docile, more enlightened, and more capable of uniting  the speculative interest with the practical.", "But if you do not take  care at the outset, or at least midway, to make men good, you will  never force them into an honest belief.", "But, it will be said, is this all that pure reason can effect, in opening up prospects beyond the limits of experience?", "Nothing more than two articles of belief?", "Common sense could have done as much as this, without taking the philosophers to counsel in the matter!", "I shall not here eulogize philosophy for the benefits which the laborious efforts of its criticism have conferred on human reasonâ€even granting that its merit should turn out in the end to be only negativeâ€for on this point something more will be said in the next section.", "But, I ask, do you require that that knowledge which concerns all men, should transcend the common understanding, and should only be revealed to you by philosophers?", "The very circumstance which has called forth your censure, is the best confirmation of the correctness of our previous assertions, since it discloses, what could not have been foreseen, that Nature is not chargeable with any partial distribution of her gifts in those matters which concern all men without distinction and that, in respect to the essential ends of human nature, we cannot advance further with the help of the highest philosophy, than under the guidance which nature has vouchsafed to the meanest understanding.", "Chapter III.", "The Architectonic of Pure Reason  By the term architectonic I mean the art of constructing a system.", "Without systematic unity, our knowledge cannot become science; it will be an aggregate, and not a system.", "Thus architectonic is the doctrine of the scientific in cognition, and therefore necessarily forms part of our methodology.", "Reason cannot permit our knowledge to remain in an unconnected and rhapsodistic state, but requires that the sum of our cognitions should constitute a system.", "It is thus alone that they can advance the ends of reason.", "By a system I mean the unity of various cognitions under one idea.", "This idea is the conceptionâ€given by reasonâ€of the form of a whole, in so far as the conception determines Ã  priori not only the limits of its content, but the place which each of its parts is to occupy.", "The scientific idea contains, therefore, the end and the form of the whole which is in accordance with that end.", "The unity of the end, to which all the parts of the system relate, and through which all have a relation to each other, communicates unity to the whole system, so that the absence of any part can be immediately detected from our knowledge of the rest; and it determines Ã  priori the limits of the system, thus excluding all contingent or arbitrary additions.", "The whole is thus an organism (articulatio), and not an aggregate (coacervatio); it may grow from within (per intussusceptionem), but it cannot increase by external additions (per appositionem).", "It is, thus, like an animal body, the growth of which does not add any limb, but, without changing their proportions, makes each in its sphere stronger and more active.", "We require, for the execution of the idea of a system, a schema, that is, a content and an arrangement of parts determined Ã  priori by the principle which the aim of the system prescribes.", "A schema which is not projected in accordance with an idea, that is, from the standpoint of the highest aim of reason, but merely empirically, in accordance with accidental aims and purposes (the number of which cannot be predetermined), can give us nothing more than technical unity.", "But the schema which is originated from an idea (in which case reason presents us with aims Ã  priori, and does not look for them to experience), forms the basis of architectonical unity.", "A science, in the proper acceptation of that term, cannot be formed technically, that is, from observation of the similarity existing between different objects, and the purely contingent use we make of our knowledge in concreto with reference to all kinds of arbitrary external aims; its constitution must be framed on architectonical principles, that is, its parts must be shown to possess an essential affinity, and be capable of being deduced from one supreme and internal aim or end, which forms the condition of the possibility of the scientific whole.", "The schema of a science must give Ã  priori the plan of it (monogramma), and the division of the whole into parts, in conformity with the idea of the science; and it must also distinguish this whole from all others, according to certain understood principles.", "No one will attempt to construct a science, unless he have some idea to rest on as a proper basis.", "But, in the elaboration of the science, he finds that the schema, nay, even the definition which he at first gave of the science, rarely corresponds with his idea; for this idea lies, like a germ, in our reason, its parts undeveloped and hid even from microscopical observation.", "For this reason, we ought to explain and define sciences, not according to the description which the originator gives of them, but according to the idea which we find based in reason itself, and which is suggested by the natural unity of the parts of the science already accumulated.", "For it will of ten be found that the originator of a science and even his latest successors remain attached to an erroneous idea, which they cannot render clear to themselves, and that they thus fail in determining the true content, the articulation or systematic unity, and the limits of their science.", "It is unfortunate that, only after having occupied ourselves for a long time in the collection of materials, under the guidance of an idea which lies undeveloped in the mind, but not according to any definite plan of arrangementâ€nay, only after we have spent much time and labour in the technical disposition of our materials, does it become possible to view the idea of a science in a clear light, and to project, according to architectonical principles, a plan of the whole, in accordance with the aims of reason.", "Systems seem, like certain worms, to be formed by a kind of generatio aequivocaâ€by the mere confluence of conceptions, and to gain completeness only with the progress of time.", "But the schema or germ of all lies in reason; and thus is not only every system organized according to its own idea, but all are united into one grand system of human knowledge, of which they form members.", "For this reason, it is possible to frame an architectonic of all human cognition, the formation of which, at the present time, considering the immense materials collected or to be found in the ruins of old systems, would not indeed be very difficult.", "Our purpose at present is merely to sketch the plan of the architectonic of all cognition given by pure reason; and we begin from the point where the main root of human knowledge divides into two, one of which is reason.", "By reason I understand here the whole higher faculty of cognition, the rational being placed in contradistinction to the empirical.", "If I make complete abstraction of the content of cognition, objectively considered, all cognition is, from a subjective point of view, either historical or rational.", "Historical cognition is cognitio ex datis, rational, cognitio ex principiis.", "Whatever may be the original source of a cognition, it is, in relation to the person who possesses it, merely historical, if he knows only what has been given him from another quarter, whether that knowledge was communicated by direct experience or by instruction.", "Thus the Person who has learned a system of philosophyâ€say the Wolfianâ€although he has a perfect knowledge of all the principles, definitions, and arguments in that philosophy, as well as of the divisions that have been made of the system, possesses really no more than an historical knowledge of the Wolfian system; he knows only what has been told him, his judgements are only those which he has received from his teachers.", "Dispute the validity of a definition, and he is completely at a loss to find another.", "He has formed his mind on anotherâ€™s; but the imitative faculty is not the productive.", "His knowledge has not been drawn from reason; and although, objectively considered, it is rational knowledge, subjectively, it is merely historical.", "He has learned this or that philosophy and is merely a plaster cast of a living man.", "Rational cognitions which are objective, that is, which have their source in reason, can be so termed from a subjective point of view, only when they have been drawn by the individual himself from the sources of reason, that is, from principles; and it is in this way alone that criticism, or even the rejection of what has been already learned, can spring up in the mind.", "All rational cognition is, again, based either on conceptions, or on the construction of conceptions.", "The former is termed philosophical, the latter mathematical.", "I have already shown the essential difference of these two methods of cognition in the first chapter.", "A cognition may be objectively philosophical and subjectively historicalâ€as is the case with the majority of scholars and those who cannot look beyond the limits of their system, and who remain in a state of pupilage all their lives.", "But it is remarkable that mathematical knowledge, when committed to memory, is valid, from the subjective point of view, as rational knowledge also, and that the same distinction cannot be drawn here as in the case of philosophical cognition.", "The reason is that the only way of arriving at this knowledge is through the essential principles of reason, and thus it is always certain and indisputable; because reason is employed in concretoâ€but at the same time Ã  prioriâ€that is, in pure and, therefore, infallible intuition; and thus all causes of illusion and error are excluded.", "Of all the Ã  priori sciences of reason, therefore, mathematics alone can be learned.", "Philosophyâ€unless it be in an historical mannerâ€cannot be learned; we can at most learn to philosophize.", "Philosophy is the system of all philosophical cognition.", "We must use this term in an objective sense, if we understand by it the archetype of all attempts at philosophizing, and the standard by which all subjective philosophies are to be judged.", "In this sense, philosophy is merely the idea of a possible science, which does not exist in concreto, but to which we endeavour in various ways to approximate, until we have discovered the right path to pursueâ€a path overgrown by the errors and illusions of senseâ€and the image we have hitherto tried in vain to shape has become a perfect copy of the great prototype.", "Until that time, we cannot learn philosophyâ€it does not exist; if it does, where is it, who possesses it, and how shall we know it?", "We can only learn to philosophize; in other words, we can only exercise our powers of reasoning in accordance with general principles, retaining at the same time, the right of investigating the sources of these principles, of testing, and even of rejecting them.", "Until then, our conception of philosophy is only a scholastic conceptionâ€a conception, that is, of a system of cognition which we are trying to elaborate into a science; all that we at present know being the systematic unity of this cognition, and consequently the logical completeness of the cognition for the desired end.", "But there is also a cosmical conception (conceptus cosmicus) of philosophy, which has always formed the true basis of this term, especially when philosophy was personified and presented to us in the ideal of a philosopher.", "In this view philosophy is the science of the relation of all cognition to the ultimate and essential aims of human reason (teleologia rationis humanae), and the philosopher is not merely an artistâ€who occupies himself with conceptionsâ€but a lawgiver, legislating for human reason.", "In this sense of the word, it would be in the highest degree arrogant to assume the title of philosopher, and to pretend that we had reached the perfection of the prototype which lies in the idea alone.", "The mathematician, the natural philosopher, and the logicianâ€how far soever the first may have advanced in rational, and the two latter in philosophical knowledgeâ€are merely artists, engaged in the arrangement and formation of conceptions; they cannot be termed philosophers.", "Above them all, there is the ideal teacher, who employs them as instruments for the advancement of the essential aims of human reason.", "Him alone can we call philosopher; but he nowhere exists.", "But the idea of his legislative power resides in the mind of every man, and it alone teaches us what kind of systematic unity philosophy demands in view of the ultimate aims of reason.", "This idea is, therefore, a cosmical conception.", "[80]   [80] By a cosmical conception, I mean one in which all men necessarily  take an interest; the aim of a science must accordingly be determined  according to scholastic conceptions, if it is regarded merely as a  means to certain arbitrarily proposed ends.", "In view of the complete systematic unity of reason, there can only be one ultimate end of all the operations of the mind.", "To this all other aims are subordinate, and nothing more than means for its attainment.", "This ultimate end is the destination of man, and the philosophy which relates to it is termed moral philosophy.", "The superior position occupied by moral philosophy, above all other spheres for the operations of reason, sufficiently indicates the reason why the ancients always included the ideaâ€and in an especial mannerâ€of moralist in that of philosopher.", "Even at the present day, we call a man who appears to have the power of self government, even although his knowledge may be very limited, by the name of philosopher.", "The legislation of human reason, or philosophy, has two objectsâ€nature and freedomâ€and thus contains not only the laws of nature, but also those of ethics, at first in two separate systems, which, finally, merge into one grand philosophical system of cognition.", "The philosophy of nature relates to that which is, that of ethics to that which ought to be.", "But all philosophy is either cognition on the basis of pure reason, or the cognition of reason on the basis of empirical principles.", "The former is termed pure, the latter empirical philosophy.", "The philosophy of pure reason is either propÃ¦deutic, that is, an inquiry into the powers of reason in regard to pure Ã  priori cognition, and is termed critical philosophy; or it is, secondly, the system of pure reasonâ€a science containing the systematic presentation of the whole body of philosophical knowledge, true as well as illusory, given by pure reasonâ€and is called metaphysic.", "This name may, however, be also given to the whole system of pure philosophy, critical philosophy included, and may designate the investigation into the sources or possibility of Ã  priori cognition, as well as the presentation of the Ã  priori cognitions which form a system of pure philosophyâ€excluding, at the same time, all empirical and mathematical elements.", "Metaphysic is divided into that of the speculative and that of the practical use of pure reason, and is, accordingly, either the metaphysic of nature, or the metaphysic of ethics.", "The former contains all the pure rational principlesâ€based upon conceptions alone (and thus excluding mathematics)â€of all theoretical cognition; the latter, the principles which determine and necessitate Ã  priori all action.", "Now moral philosophy alone contains a code of lawsâ€for the regulation of our actionsâ€which are deduced from principles entirely Ã  priori.", "Hence the metaphysic of ethics is the only pure moral philosophy, as it is not based upon anthropological or other empirical considerations.", "The metaphysic of speculative reason is what is commonly called metaphysic in the more limited sense.", "But as pure moral philosophy properly forms a part of this system of cognition, we must allow it to retain the name of metaphysic, although it is not requisite that we should insist on so terming it in our present discussion.", "It is of the highest importance to separate those cognitions which differ from others both in kind and in origin, and to take great care that they are not confounded with those with which they are generally found connected.", "What the chemist does in the analysis of substances, what the mathematician in pure mathematics, is, in a still higher degree, the duty of the philosopher, that the value of each different kind of cognition, and the part it takes in the operations of the mind, may be clearly defined.", "Human reason has never wanted a metaphysic of some kind, since it attained the power of thought, or rather of reflection; but it has never been able to keep this sphere of thought and cognition pure from all admixture of foreign elements.", "The idea of a science of this kind is as old as speculation itself; and what mind does not speculateâ€either in the scholastic or in the popular fashion?", "At the same time, it must be admitted that even thinkers by profession have been unable clearly to explain the distinction between the two elements of our cognitionâ€the one completely Ã  priori, the other Ã  posteriori; and hence the proper definition of a peculiar kind of cognition, and with it the just idea of a science which has so long and so deeply engaged the attention of the human mind, has never been established.", "When it was said  â€œMetaphysic is the science of the first principles of human cognition,â€ this definition did not signalize a peculiarity in kind, but only a difference in degree; these first principles were thus declared to be more general than others, but no criterion of distinction from empirical principles was given.", "Of these some are more general, and therefore higher, than others; andâ€as we cannot distinguish what is completely Ã  priori from that which is known to be Ã  posterioriâ€where shall we draw the line which is to separate the higher and so called first principles, from the lower and subordinate principles of cognition?", "What would be said if we were asked to be satisfied with a division of the epochs of the world into the earlier centuries and those following them?", "â€œDoes the fifth, or the tenth century belong to the earlier centuries?â€ it would be asked.", "In the same way I ask  Does the conception of extension belong to metaphysics?", "You answer, â€œYes.â€ Well, that of body too?", "â€œYes.â€ And that of a fluid body?", "You stop, you are unprepared to admit this; for if you do, everything will belong to metaphysics.", "From this it is evident that the mere degree of subordinationâ€of the particular to the generalâ€cannot determine the limits of a science; and that, in the present case, we must expect to find a difference in the conceptions of metaphysics both in kind and in origin.", "The fundamental idea of metaphysics was obscured on another side by the fact that this kind of Ã  priori cognition showed a certain similarity in character with the science of mathematics.", "Both have the property in common of possessing an Ã  priori origin; but, in the one, our knowledge is based upon conceptions, in the other, on the construction of conceptions.", "Thus a decided dissimilarity between philosophical and mathematical cognition comes outâ€a dissimilarity which was always felt, but which could not be made distinct for want of an insight into the criteria of the difference.", "And thus it happened that, as philosophers themselves failed in the proper development of the idea of their science, the elaboration of the science could not proceed with a definite aim, or under trustworthy guidance.", "Thus, too, philosophers, ignorant of the path they ought to pursue and always disputing with each other regarding the discoveries which each asserted he had made, brought their science into disrepute with the rest of the world, and finally, even among themselves.", "All pure Ã  priori cognition forms, therefore, in view of the peculiar faculty which originates it, a peculiar and distinct unity; and metaphysic is the term applied to the philosophy which attempts to represent that cognition in this systematic unity.", "The speculative part of metaphysic, which has especially appropriated this appellationâ€that which we have called the metaphysic of natureâ€and which considers everything, as it is (not as it ought to be), by means of Ã  priori conceptions, is divided in the following manner.", "Metaphysic, in the more limited acceptation of the term, consists of two partsâ€transcendental philosophy and the physiology of pure reason.", "The former presents the system of all the conceptions and principles belonging to the understanding and the reason, and which relate to objects in general, but not to any particular given objects (Ontologia); the latter has nature for its subject matter, that is, the sum of given objectsâ€whether given to the senses, or, if we will, to some other kind of intuitionâ€and is accordingly physiology, although only rationalis.", "But the use of the faculty of reason in this rational mode of regarding nature is either physical or hyperphysical, or, more properly speaking, immanent or transcendent.", "The former relates to nature, in so far as our knowledge regarding it may be applied in experience (in concreto); the latter to that connection of the objects of experience, which transcends all experience.", "Transcendent physiology has, again, an internal and an external connection with its object, both, however, transcending possible experience; the former is the physiology of nature as a whole, or transcendental cognition of the world, the latter of the connection of the whole of nature with a being above nature, or transcendental cognition of God.", "Immanent physiology, on the contrary, considers nature as the sum of all sensuous objects, consequently, as it is presented to usâ€but still according to Ã  priori conditions, for it is under these alone that nature can be presented to our minds at all.", "The objects of immanent physiology are of two kinds  1.", "Those of the external senses, or corporeal nature; 2.", "The object of the internal sense, the soul, or, in accordance with our fundamental conceptions of it, thinking nature.", "The metaphysics of corporeal nature is called physics; but, as it must contain only the principles of an Ã  priori cognition of nature, we must term it rational physics.", "The metaphysics of thinking nature is called psychology, and for the same reason is to be regarded as merely the rational cognition of the soul.", "Thus the whole system of metaphysics consists of four principal parts  1.", "Ontology; 2.", "Rational Physiology; 3.", "Rational cosmology; and 4.", "Rational theology.", "The second partâ€that of the rational doctrine of natureâ€may be subdivided into two, physica rationalis[81] and psychologia rationalis.", "[81] It must not be supposed that I mean by this appellation what is  generally called physica general is, and which is rather mathematics  than a philosophy of nature.", "For the metaphysic of nature is  completely different from mathematics, nor is it so rich in results,  although it is of great importance as a critical test of the  application of pure understandingâ€cognition to nature.", "For want of its  guidance, even mathematicians, adopting certain common notionsâ€which  are, in fact, metaphysicalâ€have unconsciously crowded their theories  of nature with hypotheses, the fallacy of which becomes evident upon  the application of the principles of this metaphysic, without  detriment, however, to the employment of mathematics in this sphere of  cognition.", "The fundamental idea of a philosophy of pure reason of necessity dictates this division; it is, therefore, architectonicalâ€in accordance with the highest aims of reason, and not merely technical, or according to certain accidentally observed similarities existing between the different parts of the whole science.", "For this reason, also, is the division immutable and of legislative authority.", "But the reader may observe in it a few points to which he ought to demur, and which may weaken his conviction of its truth and legitimacy.", "In the first place, how can I desire an Ã  priori cognition or metaphysic of objects, in so far as they are given Ã  posteriori?", "and how is it possible to cognize the nature of things according to Ã  priori principles, and to attain to a rational physiology?", "The answer is this.", "We take from experience nothing more than is requisite to present us with an object (in general) of the external or of the internal sense; in the former case, by the mere conception of matter (impenetrable and inanimate extension), in the latter, by the conception of a thinking beingâ€given in the internal empirical representation, I think.", "As to the rest, we must not employ in our metaphysic of these objects any empirical principles (which add to the content of our conceptions by means of experience), for the purpose of forming by their help any judgements respecting these objects.", "Secondly, what place shall we assign to empirical psychology, which has always been considered a part of metaphysics, and from which in our time such important philosophical results have been expected, after the hope of constructing an Ã  priori system of knowledge had been abandoned?", "I answer  It must be placed by the side of empirical physics or physics proper; that is, must be regarded as forming a part of applied philosophy, the Ã  priori principles of which are contained in pure philosophy, which is therefore connected, although it must not be confounded, with psychology.", "Empirical psychology must therefore be banished from the sphere of metaphysics, and is indeed excluded by the very idea of that science.", "In conformity, however, with scholastic usage, we must permit it to occupy a place in metaphysicsâ€but only as an appendix to it.", "We adopt this course from motives of economy; as psychology is not as yet full enough to occupy our attention as an independent study, while it is, at the same time, of too great importance to be entirely excluded or placed where it has still less affinity than it has with the subject of metaphysics.", "It is a stranger who has been long a guest; and we make it welcome to stay, until it can take up a more suitable abode in a complete system of anthropologyâ€the pendant to empirical physics.", "The above is the general idea of metaphysics, which, as more was expected from it than could be looked for with justice, and as these pleasant expectations were unfortunately never realized, fell into general disrepute.", "Our Critique must have fully convinced the reader that, although metaphysics cannot form the foundation of religion, it must always be one of its most important bulwarks, and that human reason, which naturally pursues a dialectical course, cannot do without this science, which checks its tendencies towards dialectic and, by elevating reason to a scientific and clear self knowledge, prevents the ravages which a lawless speculative reason would infallibly commit in the sphere of morals as well as in that of religion.", "We may be sure, therefore, whatever contempt may be thrown upon metaphysics by those who judge a science not by its own nature, but according to the accidental effects it may have produced, that it can never be completely abandoned, that we must always return to it as to a beloved one who has been for a time estranged, because the questions with which it is engaged relate to the highest aims of humanity, and reason must always labour either to attain to settled views in regard to these, or to destroy those which others have already established.", "Metaphysic, thereforeâ€that of nature, as well as that of ethics, but in an especial manner the criticism which forms the propÃ¦deutic to all the operations of reasonâ€forms properly that department of knowledge which may be termed, in the truest sense of the word, philosophy.", "The path which it pursues is that of science, which, when it has once been discovered, is never lost, and never misleads.", "Mathematics, natural science, the common experience of men, have a high value as means, for the most part, to accidental endsâ€but at last also, to those which are necessary and essential to the existence of humanity.", "But to guide them to this high goal, they require the aid of rational cognition on the basis of pure conceptions, which, be it termed as it may, is properly nothing but metaphysics.", "For the same reason, metaphysics forms likewise the completion of the culture of human reason.", "In this respect, it is indispensable, setting aside altogether the influence which it exerts as a science.", "For its subject matter is the elements and highest maxims of reason, which form the basis of the possibility of some sciences and of the use of all.", "That, as a purely speculative science, it is more useful in preventing error than in the extension of knowledge, does not detract from its value; on the contrary, the supreme office of censor which it occupies assures to it the highest authority and importance.", "This office it administers for the purpose of securing order, harmony, and well being to science, and of directing its noble and fruitful labours to the highest possible aimâ€the happiness of all mankind.", "Chapter IV.", "The History of Pure Reason  This title is placed here merely for the purpose of designating a division of the system of pure reason of which I do not intend to treat at present.", "I shall content myself with casting a cursory glance, from a purely transcendental point of viewâ€that of the nature of pure reasonâ€on the labours of philosophers up to the present time.", "They have aimed at erecting an edifice of philosophy; but to my eye this edifice appears to be in a very ruinous condition.", "It is very remarkable, although naturally it could not have been otherwise, that, in the infancy of philosophy, the study of the nature of God and the constitution of a future world formed the commencement, rather than the conclusion, as we should have it, of the speculative efforts of the human mind.", "However rude the religious conceptions generated by the remains of the old manners and customs of a less cultivated time, the intelligent classes were not thereby prevented from devoting themselves to free inquiry into the existence and nature of God; and they easily saw that there could be no surer way of pleasing the invisible ruler of the world, and of attaining to happiness in another world at least, than a good and honest course of life in this.", "Thus theology and morals formed the two chief motives, or rather the points of attraction in all abstract inquiries.", "But it was the former that especially occupied the attention of speculative reason, and which afterwards became so celebrated under the name of metaphysics.", "I shall not at present indicate the periods of time at which the greatest changes in metaphysics took place, but shall merely give a hasty sketch of the different ideas which occasioned the most important revolutions in this sphere of thought.", "There are three different ends in relation to which these revolutions have taken place.", "1.", "In relation to the object of the cognition of reason, philosophers may be divided into sensualists and intellectualists.", "Epicurus may be regarded as the head of the former, Plato of the latter.", "The distinction here signalized, subtle as it is, dates from the earliest times, and was long maintained.", "The former asserted that reality resides in sensuous objects alone, and that everything else is merely imaginary; the latter, that the senses are the parents of illusion and that truth is to be found in the understanding alone.", "The former did not deny to the conceptions of the understanding a certain kind of reality; but with them it was merely logical, with the others it was mystical.", "The former admitted intellectual conceptions, but declared that sensuous objects alone possessed real existence.", "The latter maintained that all real objects were intelligible, and believed that the pure understanding possessed a faculty of intuition apart from sense, which, in their opinion, served only to confuse the ideas of the understanding.", "2.", "In relation to the origin of the pure cognitions of reason, we find one school maintaining that they are derived entirely from experience, and another that they have their origin in reason alone.", "Aristotle may be regarded as the bead of the empiricists, and Plato of the noologists.", "Locke, the follower of Aristotle in modern times, and Leibnitz of Plato (although he cannot be said to have imitated him in his mysticism), have not been able to bring this question to a settled conclusion.", "The procedure of Epicurus in his sensual system, in which he always restricted his conclusions to the sphere of experience, was much more consequent than that of Aristotle and Locke.", "The latter especially, after having derived all the conceptions and principles of the mind from experience, goes so far, in the employment of these conceptions and principles, as to maintain that we can prove the existence of God and the existence of God and the immortality of them objects lying beyond the soulâ€both of them of possible experienceâ€with the same force of demonstration as any mathematical proposition.", "3.", "In relation to method.", "Method is procedure according to principles.", "We may divide the methods at present employed in the field of inquiry into the naturalistic and the scientific.", "The naturalist of pure reason lays it down as his principle that common reason, without the aid of scienceâ€which he calls sound reason, or common senseâ€can give a more satisfactory answer to the most important questions of metaphysics than speculation is able to do.", "He must maintain, therefore, that we can determine the content and circumference of the moon more certainly by the naked eye, than by the aid of mathematical reasoning.", "But this system is mere misology reduced to principles; and, what is the most absurd thing in this doctrine, the neglect of all scientific means is paraded as a peculiar method of extending our cognition.", "As regards those who are naturalists because they know no better, they are certainly not to be blamed.", "They follow common sense, without parading their ignorance as a method which is to teach us the wonderful secret, how we are to find the truth which lies at the bottom of the well of Democritus.", "Quod sapio satis est mihi, non ego curo Esse quod Arcesilas aerumnosiqueSolones.", "PERSIUS â€Satirae, iii.", "78 79.    is their motto, under which they may lead a pleasant and praiseworthy  life, without troubling themselves with science or troubling science  with them.", "As regards those who wish to pursue a scientific method, they have now the choice of following either the dogmatical or the sceptical, while they are bound never to desert the systematic mode of procedure.", "When I mention, in relation to the former, the celebrated Wolf, and as regards the latter, David Hume, I may leave, in accordance with my present intention, all others unnamed.", "The critical path alone is still open.", "If my reader has been kind and patient enough to accompany me on this hitherto untravelled route, he can now judge whether, if he and others will contribute their exertions towards making this narrow footpath a high road of thought, that which many centuries have failed to accomplish may not be executed before the close of the presentâ€namely, to bring Reason to perfect contentment in regard to that which has always, but without permanent results, occupied her powers and engaged her ardent desire for knowledge.", "WHEN I was twelve or thirteen years old, an uncle of mine who gave me my love for books and pictures promised to take me upon a memorable expedition.", "I was to go with him to the top of the tower of Old Saint Lawrence in Rotterdam.", "And so, one fine day, a sexton with a key as large as that of Saint Peter opened a mysterious door.", "\"Ring the bell,\" he said, \"when you come back and want to get out,\" and with a great grinding of rusty old hinges he separated us from the noise of the busy street and locked us into a world of new and strange experiences.", "For the first time in my life I was confronted by the phenomenon of audible silence.", "When we had climbed the first flight of stairs, I added another discovery to my limited knowledge of natural phenomena  that of tangible darkness.", "A match showed us where the upward road continued.", "We went to the next floor and then to the next and the next until I had lost count and then there came still another floor, and suddenly we had plenty of light.", "This floor was on an even height with the roof of the church, and it was used as a storeroom.", "Covered with many inches of dust, there lay the abandoned symbols of a venerable faith which had been discarded by the good people of the city many years ago.", "That which had meant life and death to our ancestors was here reduced to junk and rubbish.", "The industrious rat had built his nest among the carved images and the ever watchful spider had opened up shop between the outspread arms of a kindly saint.", "The next floor showed us from where we had derived our light.", "Enormous open windows with heavy iron bars made the high and barren room the roosting place of hundreds of pigeons.", "The wind blew through the iron bars and the air was filled with a weird and pleasing music.", "It was the noise of the town below us, but a noise which had been purified and cleansed by the distance.", "The rumbling of heavy carts and the clinking of horses' hoofs, the winding of cranes and pulleys, the hissing sound of the patient steam which had been set to do the work of man in a thousand different ways  they had all been blended into a softly rustling whisper which provided a beautiful background for the trembling cooing of the pigeons.", "Here the stairs came to an end and the ladders began.", "And after the first ladder (a slippery old thing which made one feel his way with a cautious foot) there was a new and even greater wonder, the town clock.", "I saw the heart of time.", "I could hear the heavy pulsebeats of the rapid seconds  one  two  three  up to sixty.", "Then a sudden quivering noise when all the wheels seemed to stop and another minute had been chopped off eternity.", "Without pause it began again  one  two  three  until at last after a warning rumble and the scraping of many wheels a thunderous voice, high above us, told the world that it was the hour of noon.", "On the next floor were the bells.", "The nice little bells and their terrible sisters.", "In the centre the big bell, which made me turn stiff with fright when I heard it in the middle of the night telling a story of fire or flood.", "In solitary grandeur it seemed to reflect upon those six hundred years during which it had shared the joys and the sorrows of the good people of Rotterdam.", "Around it, neatly arranged like the blue jars in an old fashioned apothecary shop, hung the little fellows, who twice each week played a merry tune for the benefit of the country folk who had come to market to buy and sell and hear what the big world had been doing.", "But in a corner  all alone and shunned by the others  a big black bell, silent and stern, the bell of death.", "Then darkness once more and other ladders, steeper and even more dangerous than those we had climbed before, and suddenly the fresh air of the wide heavens.", "We had reached the highest gallery.", "Above us the sky.", "Below us the city  a little toy town, where busy ants were hastily crawling hither and thither, each one intent upon his or her particular business, and beyond the jumble of stones, the wide greenness of the open country.", "It was my first glimpse of the big world.", "Since then, whenever I have had the opportunity, I have gone to the top of the tower and enjoyed myself.", "It was hard work, but it repaid in full the mere physical exertion of climbing a few stairs.", "Besides, I knew what my reward would be.", "I would see the land and the sky, and I would listen to the stories of my kind friend the watchman, who lived in a small shack, built in a sheltered corner of the gallery.", "He looked after the clock and was a father to the bells, and he warned of fires, but he enjoyed many free hours and then he smoked a pipe and thought his own peaceful thoughts.", "He had gone to school almost fifty years before and he had rarely read a book, but he had lived on the top of his tower for so many years that he had absorbed the wisdom of that wide world which surrounded him on all sides.", "History he knew well, for it was a living thing with him.", "\"There,\" he would say, pointing to a bend of the river, \"there, my boy, do you see those trees?", "That is where the Prince of Orange cut the dikes to drown the land and save Leyden.\"", "Or he would tell me the tale of the old Meuse, until the broad river ceased to be a convenient harbour and became a wonderful highroad, carrying the ships of De Ruyter and Tromp upon that famous last voyage, when they gave their lives that the sea might be free to all.", "Then there were the little villages, clustering around the protecting church which once, many years ago, had been the home of their Patron Saints.", "In the distance we could see the leaning tower of Delft.", "Within sight of its high arches, William the Silent had been murdered and there Grotius had learned to construe his first Latin sentences.", "And still further away, the long low body of the church of Gouda, the early home of the man whose wit had proved mightier than the armies of many an emperor, the charity boy whom the world came to know as Erasmus.", "Finally the silver line of the endless sea and as a contrast, immediately below us, the patchwork of roofs and chimneys and houses and gardens and hospitals and schools and railways, which we called our home.", "But the tower showed us the old home in a new light.", "The confused commotion of the streets and the market place, of the factories and the workshop, became the well ordered expression of human energy and purpose.", "Best of all, the wide view of the glorious past, which surrounded us on all sides, gave us new courage to face the problems of the future when we had gone back to our daily tasks.", "History is the mighty Tower of Experience, which Time has built amidst the endless fields of bygone ages.", "It is no easy task to reach the top of this ancient structure and get the benefit of the full view.", "There is no elevator, but young feet are strong and it can be done.", "Here I give you the key that will open the door.", "When you return, you too will understand the reason for my enthusiasm.", "HIGH Up in the North in the land called Svithjod, there stands a rock.", "It is a hundred miles high and a hundred miles wide.", "Once every thousand years a little bird comes to this rock to sharpen its beak.", "When the rock has thus been worn away, then a single day of eternity will have gone by.", "WE live under the shadow of a gigantic question mark.", "Who are we?", "Where do we come from?", "Whither are we bound?", "Slowly, but with persistent courage, we have been pushing this question mark further and further towards that distant line, beyond the horizon, where we hope to find our answer.", "We have not gone very far.", "We still know very little but we have reached the point where (with a fair degree of accuracy) we can guess at many things.", "In this chapter I shall tell you how (according to our best belief) the stage was set for the first appearance of man.", "If we represent the time during which it has been possible for animal life to exist upon our planet by a line of this length, then the tiny line just below indicates the age during which man (or a creature more or less resembling man) has lived upon this earth.", "Man was the last to come but the first to use his brain for the purpose of conquering the forces of nature.", "That is the reason why we are going to study him, rather than cats or dogs or horses or any of the other animals, who, all in their own way, have a very interesting historical development behind them.", "In the beginning, the planet upon which we live was (as far as we now know) a large ball of flaming matter, a tiny cloud of smoke in the endless ocean of space.", "Gradually, in the course of millions of years, the surface burned itself out, and was covered with a thin layer of rocks.", "Upon these lifeless rocks the rain descended in endless torrents, wearing out the hard granite and carrying the dust to the valleys that lay hidden between the high cliffs of the steaming earth.", "Finally the hour came when the sun broke through the clouds and saw how this little planet was covered with a few small puddles which were to develop into the mighty oceans of the eastern and western hemispheres.", "Then one day the great wonder happened.", "What had been dead, gave birth to life.", "The first living cell floated upon the waters of the sea.", "For millions of years it drifted aimlessly with the currents.", "But during all that time it was developing certain habits that it might survive more easily upon the inhospitable earth.", "Some of these cells were happiest in the dark depths of the lakes and the pools.", "They took root in the slimy sediments which had been carried down from the tops of the hills and they became plants.", "Others preferred to move about and they grew strange jointed legs, like scorpions and began to crawl along the bottom of the sea amidst the plants and the pale green things that looked like jelly fishes.", "Still others (covered with scales) depended upon a swimming motion to go from place to place in their search for food, and gradually they populated the ocean with myriads of fishes.", "Meanwhile the plants had increased in number and they had to search for new dwelling places.", "There was no more room for them at the bottom of the sea.", "Reluctantly they left the water and made a new home in the marshes and on the mud banks that lay at the foot of the mountains.", "Twice a day the tides of the ocean covered them with their brine.", "For the rest of the time, the plants made the best of their uncomfortable situation and tried to survive in the thin air which surrounded the surface of the planet.", "After centuries of training, they learned how to live as comfortably in the air as they had done in the water.", "They increased in size and became shrubs and trees and at last they learned how to grow lovely flowers which attracted the attention of the busy big bumble bees and the birds who carried the seeds far and wide until the whole earth had become covered with green pastures, or lay dark under the shadow of the big trees.", "But some of the fishes too had begun to leave the sea, and they had learned how to breathe with lungs as well as with gills.", "We call such creatures amphibious, which means that they are able to live with equal ease on the land and in the water.", "The first frog who crosses your path can tell you all about the pleasures of the double existence of the amphibian.", "Once outside of the water, these animals gradually adapted themselves more and more to life on land.", "Some became reptiles (creatures who crawl like lizards) and they shared the silence of the forests with the insects.", "That they might move faster through the soft soil, they improved upon their legs and their size increased until the world was populated with gigantic forms (which the hand books of biology list under the names of Ichthyosaurus and Megalosaurus and Brontosaurus) who grew to be thirty to forty feet long and who could have played with elephants as a full grown cat plays with her kittens.", "Some of the members of this reptilian family began to live in the tops of the trees, which were then often more than a hundred feet high.", "They no longer needed their legs for the purpose of walking, but it was necessary for them to move quickly from branch to branch.", "And so they changed a part of their skin into a sort of parachute, which stretched between the sides of their bodies and the small toes of their fore feet, and gradually they covered this skinny parachute with feathers and made their tails into a steering gear and flew from tree to tree and developed into true birds.", "Then a strange thing happened.", "All the gigantic reptiles died within a short time.", "We do not know the reason.", "Perhaps it was due to a sudden change in climate.", "Perhaps they had grown so large that they could neither swim nor walk nor crawl, and they starved to death within sight but not within reach of the big ferns and trees.", "Whatever the cause, the million year old world empire of the big reptiles was over.", "The world now began to be occupied by very different creatures.", "They were the descendants of the reptiles but they were quite unlike these because they fed their young from the \"mammae\" or the breasts of the mother.", "Wherefore modern science calls these animals \"mammals.\"", "They had shed the scales of the fish.", "They did not adopt the feathers of the bird, but they covered their bodies with hair.", "The mammals however developed other habits which gave their race a great advantage over the other animals.", "The female of the species carried the eggs of the young inside her body until they were hatched and while all other living beings, up to that time, had left their children exposed to the dangers of cold and heat, and the attacks of wild beasts, the mammals kept their young with them for a long time and sheltered them while they were still too weak to fight their enemies.", "In this way the young mammals were given a much better chance to survive, because they learned many things from their mothers, as you will know if you have ever watched a cat teaching her kittens to take care of themselves and how to wash their faces and how to catch mice.", "But of these mammals I need not tell you much for you know them well.", "They surround you on all sides.", "They are your daily companions in the streets and in your home, and you can see your less familiar cousins behind the bars of the zoological garden.", "And now we come to the parting of the ways when man suddenly leaves the endless procession of dumbly living and dying creatures and begins to use his reason to shape the destiny of his race.", "One mammal in particular seemed to surpass all others in its ability to find food and shelter.", "It had learned to use its fore feet for the purpose of holding its prey, and by dint of practice it had developed a hand like claw.", "After innumerable attempts it had learned how to balance the whole of the body upon the hind legs.", "(This is a difficult act, which every child has to learn anew although the human race has been doing it for over a million years.)", "This creature, half ape and half monkey but superior to both, became the most successful hunter and could make a living in every clime.", "For greater safety, it usually moved about in groups.", "It learned how to make strange grunts to warn its young of approaching danger and after many hundreds of thousands of years it began to use these throaty noises for the purpose of talking.", "This creature, though you may hardly believe it, was your first \"man like\" ancestor.", "OUR EARLIEST ANCESTORS   WE know very little about the first \"true\" men.", "We have never seen their pictures.", "In the deepest layer of clay of an ancient soil we have sometimes found pieces of their bones.", "These lay buried amidst the broken skeletons of other animals that have long since disappeared from the face of the earth.", "Anthropologists (learned scientists who devote their lives to the study of man as a member of the animal kingdom) have taken these bones and they have been able to reconstruct our earliest ancestors with a fair degree of accuracy.", "The great great grandfather of the human race was a very ugly and unattractive mammal.", "He was quite small, much smaller than the people of today.", "The heat of the sun and the biting wind of the cold winter had coloured his skin a dark brown.", "His head and most of his body, his arms and legs too, were covered with long, coarse hair.", "He had very thin but strong fingers which made his hands look like those of a monkey.", "His forehead was low and his jaw was like the jaw of a wild animal which uses its teeth both as fork and knife.", "He wore no clothes.", "He had seen no fire except the flames of the rumbling volcanoes which filled the earth with their smoke and their lava.", "He lived in the damp blackness of vast forests, as the pygmies of Africa do to this very day.", "When he felt the pangs of hunger he ate raw leaves and the roots of plants or he took the eggs away from an angry bird and fed them to his own young.", "Once in a while, after a long and patient chase, he would catch a sparrow or a small wild dog or perhaps a rabbit.", "These he would eat raw for he had never discovered that food tasted better when it was cooked.", "During the hours of day, this primitive human being prowled about looking for things to eat.", "When night descended upon the

European race, because it conquered not only Europe but also made itself the ruling class in the country which is now known as British India.", "These Indo Europeans were white men like the Semites

first hear of them, they had been living along the shores of the Caspian Sea for many centuries.", "But one day they had packed their tents and they had wandered forth in search of a new home.", "Some of them had moved into the mountains of Central Asia and for many centuries they had lived among the peaks which surround the plateau of Iran and that is why we call them Aryans.", "Others had followed the setting sun and they had taken possession of the plains of Europe as I shall tell you when I give you the story of Greece and Rome.", "For the moment we must follow the Aryans.", "Under the leadership of Zarathustra (or Zoroaster) who was their great teacher many of them had left their mountain homes to follow the swiftly flowing Indus river on its way to the sea.", "Others had

time to look after their families and their business if they were forever running to the market place to discuss affairs of state?", "In this chapter I shall tell you.", "In all matters of government, the Greek democracy recognised only one class of citizens  the freemen.", "Every Greek city was composed of a small number of free born citizens, a large number of slaves and a sprinkling of foreigners.", "At rare intervals (usually during a war, when men were needed for the army) the Greeks showed themselves willing to confer the rights of citizenship upon the \"barbarians\" as they called the foreigners.", "But this was an exception.", "Citizenship was a matter of birth.", "You were an Athenian because your father and your grandfather had been Athenians before you.", "But however great your merits as a trader or a soldier, if you were born of non Athenian parents, you remained a \"foreigner\" until the end of time.", "The Greek city, therefore, whenever it was not ruled by a king or a tyrant, was run by and for the freemen, and this would not have been possible without a large army of slaves who outnumbered the free citizens at the rate of six or five to one and who performed those tasks to which we modern people must devote most of our time and energy if we wish to provide for our families and pay the rent of our apartments.", "The slaves did all the cooking and baking and candlestick making of the entire city.", "They were the tailors and the carpenters and the jewelers and the school teachers and the bookkeepers and they tended the store and looked after the factory while the master went to the public meeting to discuss questions of war and peace or visited the theatre to see the latest play of AEschylus or hear a discussion of the revolutionary ideas of Euripides, who had dared to express certain doubts upon the omnipotence of the great god Zeus.", "Indeed, ancient Athens resembled a modern club.", "All the freeborn citizens were hereditary members and all the slaves were hereditary servants, and waited upon the needs of their masters, and it was very pleasant to be a member of the organisation.", "But when we talk about slaves, we do not mean the sort of people about whom you have read in the pages of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\"", "It is true that the position of those slaves who tilled the fields was a very unpleasant one, but the average freeman who had come down in the world and who had been obliged to hire himself out as a farm hand led just as miserable a life.", "In the cities, furthermore, many of the slaves were more prosperous than the poorer classes of the freemen.", "For the Greeks, who loved moderation in all things, did not like to treat their slaves after the fashion which afterward was so common in Rome, where a slave had as few rights as an engine in a modern factory and could be thrown to the wild animals upon the smallest pretext.", "The Greeks accepted slavery as a necessary institution, without which no city could possibly become the home of a truly civilised people.", "The slaves also took care of those tasks which nowadays are performed by the business men and the professional men.", "As for those household duties which take up so much of the time of your mother and which worry your father when he comes home from his office, the Greeks, who understood the value of leisure, had reduced such duties to the smallest possible minimum by living amidst surroundings of extreme simplicity.", "To begin with, their homes were very plain.", "Even the rich nobles spent their lives in a sort of adobe barn, which lacked all the comforts which a modern workman expects as his natural right.", "A Greek home consisted of four walls and a roof.", "There was a door which led into the street but there were no windows.", "The kitchen, the living rooms and the sleeping quarters were built around an open courtyard in which there was a small fountain, or a statue and a few plants to make it look bright.", "Within this courtyard the family lived when it did not rain or when it was not too cold.", "In one corner of the yard the cook (who was a slave) prepared the meal and in another corner, the teacher (who was also a slave) taught the children the alpha beta gamma and the tables of multiplication and in still another corner the lady of the house, who rarely left her domain (since it was not considered good form for a married woman to be seen on the street too often) was repairing her husband's coat with her seamstresses (who were slaves,) and in the little office, right off the door, the master was inspecting the accounts which the overseer of his farm (who was a slave) had just brought to him.", "When dinner was ready the family came together but the meal was a very simple one and did not take much time.", "The Greeks seem to have regarded eating as an unavoidable evil and not a pastime, which kills many dreary hours and eventually kills many dreary people.", "They lived on bread and on wine, with a little meat and some green vegetables.", "They drank water only when nothing else was available because they did not think it very healthy.", "They loved to call on each other for dinner, but our idea of a festive meal, where everybody is supposed to eat much more than is good for him, would have disgusted them.", "They came together at the table for the purpose of a good talk and a good glass of wine and water, but as they were moderate people they despised those who drank too much.", "The same simplicity which prevailed in the dining room also dominated their choice of clothes.", "They liked to be clean and well groomed, to have their hair and beards neatly cut, to feel their bodies strong with the exercise and the swimming of the gymnasium, but they never followed the Asiatic fashion which prescribed loud colours and strange patterns.", "They wore a long white coat and they managed to look as smart as a modern Italian officer in his long blue cape.", "They loved to see their wives wear ornaments but they thought it very vulgar to display their wealth (or their wives) in public and whenever the women left their home they were as inconspicuous as possible.", "In short, the story of Greek life is a story not only of moderation but also of simplicity.", "\"Things,\" chairs and tables and books and houses and carriages, are apt to take up a great deal of their owner's time.", "In the end they invariably make him their slave and his hours are spent looking after their wants, keeping them polished and brushed and painted.", "The Greeks, before everything else, wanted to be \"free,\" both in mind and in body.", "That they might maintain their liberty, and be truly free in spirit, they reduced their daily needs

listen to them.", "But the theatre, the form of entertainment which has become almost a necessary part of our own lives, did not grow out of these recited heroic tales.", "It had such a curious origin

everybody in Greece drank wine (the Greeks thought water only useful for the purpose of swimming and sailing) this particular Divinity was as popular as a God of the Soda Fountain would be in our own

wear goat skins and to hee haw like real billy goats.", "The Greek word for goat is \"tragos\" and the Greek word for singer is \"oidos.\"", "The singer who meh mehed like a goat therefore was called a \"tragos oidos\" or goat singer, and it is this strange name which developed into the modern word \"Tragedy,\" which means in the theatrical sense a piece with an unhappy ending, just as Comedy (which really means the singing of something \"comos\" or gay) is the name given to a play which ends happily.", "But how, you will ask, did this noisy chorus of masqueraders, stamping around like wild goats, ever develop into the noble tragedies which have filled the theatres of the world for almost two thousand years?", "The connecting link between the goat singer and Hamlet is really very simple as I shall show you in a moment.", "The singing chorus was very amusing in the beginning and attracted large crowds of spectators who stood along the side of the road and laughed.", "But soon this business of tree hawing grew tiresome and the Greeks thought dullness an evil only comparable to ugliness or sickness.", "They asked for something more entertaining.", "Then an inventive young poet from the village of Icaria in Attica hit upon a new idea which proved a tremendous success.", "He made one of the members of the goat chorus step forward and engage in conversation with the leader of the musicians who marched at the head of the parade playing upon their pipes of Pan.", "This individual was allowed to step out of line.", "He waved his arms and gesticulated while he spoke (that is to say he \"acted\" while the others merely stood by and sang) and he asked a lot of questions, which the bandmaster answered according to the roll of papyrus upon which the poet had written down these answers before the show began.", "This rough and ready conversation  the dialogue  which told the story of Dionysos or one of the other Gods, became at once popular with the crowd.", "Henceforth every Dionysian procession had an \"acted scene\" and very soon the \"acting\" was considered more important than the procession and the meh mehing.", "AEschylus, the most successful of all \"tragedians\" who wrote no less than eighty plays during his long life (from 526 to 455) made a bold step forward when he introduced two \"actors\" instead of one.", "A generation later Sophocles increased the number of actors to three.", "When Euripides began to write his terrible tragedies in the middle of the fifth century, B.C., he was allowed as many actors as he liked and when Aristophanes wrote those famous comedies in which he poked fun at everybody and everything, including the Gods of Mount Olympus, the chorus had been reduced to the role of mere bystanders who were lined up behind the principal performers and who sang \"this is a terrible world\" while the hero in the foreground committed a crime against the will of the Gods.", "This new form of dramatic entertainment demanded a proper setting, and soon every Greek city owned a theatre, cut out of the rock of a nearby hill.", "The spectators sat upon wooden benches and faced a wide circle (our present orchestra where you pay three dollars and thirty cents for a seat).", "Upon this half circle, which was the stage, the actors and the chorus took their stand.", "Behind them there was a tent where they made up with large clay masks which hid their faces and which showed the spectators whether the actors were supposed to be happy and smiling or unhappy and weeping.", "The Greek word for tent is \"skene\" and that is the reason why we talk of the \"scenery\" of the stage.", "When once the tragedy had become part of Greek life, the people took it very seriously and never went to the theatre to give their minds a vacation.", "A new play became as important an event as an election and a successful playwright was received with greater honors than those bestowed upon a general who had just

kings, the descendants of the ancient tribal chieftains.", "But once the kings had been driven from the city, the Romans were forced to bridle the power of the nobles, and it took many centuries

"This made Italy the one country where there was a comparative abundance of gold and silver.", "Finally, during the Crusades, the Italian cities had become the point of embarkation for the Crusaders and had profiteered to an almost unbelievable extent.", "And after the Crusades had come to an end, these same Italian cities remained the distributing centres for those Oriental goods upon which the people of Europe had come to depend during the time they had spent in the near east.", "Of these towns, few were as famous as Venice.", "Venice was a republic built upon a mud bank.", "Thither people from the mainland had fled during the invasions of the barbarians in the fourth century.", "Surrounded on all sides by the sea they had engaged in the business of salt making.", "Salt had been very scarce during the Middle Ages, and the price had been high.", "For hundreds of years Venice had enjoyed a monopoly of this indispensable table commodity (I say indispensable, because people, like sheep, fall ill unless they get a certain amount of salt in their food).", "The people had used this monopoly to increase the power of their city.", "At times they had even dared to defy the power of the Popes.", "The town had grown rich and had begun to build ships, which engaged in trade with the Orient.", "During the Crusades, these ships were used to carry passengers to the Holy Land, and when the passengers could not pay for their tickets in cash, they were obliged to help the Venetians who were for ever increasing their colonies in the AEgean Sea, in Asia Minor and in Egypt.", "By the end of the fourteenth century, the population had grown to two hundred thousand, which made Venice the biggest city of the Middle Ages.", "The people were without influence upon the government which was the private affair of a small number of rich merchant families.", "They elected a senate and a Doge (or Duke), but the actual rulers of the city were the members of the famous Council of Ten,  who maintained themselves with the help of a highly organised system of secret service men and professional murderers, who kept watch upon all citizens and quietly removed those who might be dangerous to the safety of their high handed and unscrupulous Committee of Public Safety.", "The other extreme of government, a democracy of very turbulent habits, was to be found in Florence.", "This city controlled the main road from northern Europe to Rome and used the money which it had derived from this fortunate economic position to engage in manufacturing.", "The Florentines tried to follow the example of Athens.", "Noblemen, priests and members of the guilds all took part in the discussions of civic affairs.", "This led to great civic upheaval.", "People were forever being divided into political parties and these parties fought each other with intense bitterness and exiled their enemies and confiscated their possessions as soon as they had gained a victory in the council.", "After several centuries of this rule by organised mobs, the inevitable happened.", "A powerful family made itself master of the city and governed the town and the surrounding country after the fashion of the old Greek \"tyrants.\"", "They were called the Medici.", "The earliest Medici had been physicians (medicus is Latin for physician, hence their name), but later they had turned banker.", "Their banks and their pawnshops were to be found in all the more important centres of trade.", "Even today our American pawn shops display the three golden balls which were part of the coat of arms of the mighty house of the Medici, who became rulers of Florence and married their daughters to the kings of France and were buried in graves worthy of a Roman Caesar.", "Then there was Genoa, the great rival of Venice, where the merchants specialised in trade with Tunis in Africa and the grain depots of the Black Sea.", "Then there were more than two hundred other cities, some large and some small, each a perfect commercial unit, all of them fighting their neighbours and rivals with the undying hatred of neighbours who are depriving each other of their profits.", "Once the products of the Orient and Africa had been brought to these distributing centres, they must be prepared for the voyage to the west and the north.", "Genoa carried her goods by water to Marseilles, from where they were reshipped to the cities along the Rhone, which in turn served as the market places of northern and western France.", "Venice used the land route to northern Europe.", "This ancient road led across the Brenner pass, the old gateway for the barbarians who had invaded Italy.", "Past Innsbruck, the merchandise was carried to Basel.", "From there it drifted down the Rhine to the North Sea and England, or it was taken to Augsburg where the Fugger family (who were both bankers and manufacturers and who prospered greatly by \"shaving\" the coins with which they paid their workmen), looked after the further distribution to Nuremberg and Leipzig and the cities of the Baltic and to Wisby (on the Island of Gotland) which looked after the needs of the Northern Baltic and dealt directly with the Republic of Novgorod, the old commercial centre of Russia which was destroyed by Ivan the Terrible in the middle of the sixteenth century.", "The little cities on the coast of north western Europe had an interesting story of their own.", "The mediaeval world ate a great deal of fish.", "There were many fast days and then people were not permitted to eat meat.", "For those who lived away from the coast and from the rivers, this meant a diet of eggs or nothing at all.", "But early in the thirteenth century a Dutch fisherman had discovered a way of curing herring, so that it could be transported to distant points.", "The herring fisheries of the North Sea then became of great importance.", "But some time during the thirteenth century, this useful little fish (for reasons of its own) moved from the North Sea to the Baltic and the cities of that inland sea began to make money.", "All the world now sailed to the Baltic to catch herring and as that fish could only be caught during a few months each year (the rest of the time it spends in deep water, raising large families of little herrings) the ships would have been idle during the rest of the time unless they had found another occupation.", "They were then used to carry the wheat of northern and central Russia to southern and western Europe.", "On the return voyage they brought spices and silks and carpets and Oriental rugs from Venice and Genoa to Bruges and Hamburg and Bremen.", "Out of such simple beginnings there developed an important system of international trade which reached from the manufacturing cities of Bruges and Ghent (where the almighty guilds fought pitched battles with the kings of France and England and established a labour tyranny which completely ruined both the employers and the workmen) to the Republic of Novgorod in northern Russia, which was a mighty city until Tsar Ivan, who distrusted all merchants, took the town and killed sixty thousand people in less than a month's time and reduced the survivors to beggary.", "That they might protect themselves against pirates and excessive tolls and annoying legislation, the merchants of the north founded a protective league which was called the \"Hansa.\"", "The Hansa, which had its headquarters in Lubeck, was a voluntary association of more than one hundred cities.", "The association maintained a navy of its own which patrolled the seas and fought and defeated the Kings of England and Denmark when they dared to interfere with the rights and the privileges of the mighty Hanseatic merchants.", "I wish that I had more space to tell you some of the wonderful stories of this strange commerce which was carried on across the high mountains and across the deep seas amidst such dangers that every voyage became a glorious adventure.", "But it would take several volumes and it cannot be done here.", "Besides, I hope that I have told you enough about the Middle Ages to make you curious to read more in the excellent books of which I shall give you a list at the end of this volume.", "The Middle Ages, as I have tried to show you, had been a period of very slow progress.", "The people who were in power believed that \"progress\" was a very undesirable invention of the Evil One and ought to be discouraged, and as they hap pened to occupy the seats of the mighty, it was easy to enforce their will upon the patient serfs and the illiterate knights.", "Here and there a few brave souls sometimes ventured forth into the forbidden region of science, but they fared badly and were considered lucky when they escaped with their lives and a jail sentence of twenty years.", "In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the flood of international commerce swept over western Europe as the Nile had swept across the valley of ancient Egypt.", "It left behind a fertile sediment of prosperity.", "Prosperity meant leisure hours and these leisure hours gave both men and women a chance to buy manuscripts and take an interest in literature and art and music.", "Then once more was the world filled with that divine curiosity which has elevated man from the ranks of those other mammals who are his distant cousins but who have remained dumb, and the cities, of whose growth and development I have told you in my last chapter, offered a safe shelter to these brave pioneers who dared to leave the very narrow domain of the established order of things.", "They set to work.", "They opened the windows of their cloistered and studious cells.", "A flood of sunlight entered the dusty rooms and showed them the cobwebs which had gathered during the long period of semi darkness.", "They began to clean house.", "Next they cleaned their gardens.", "Then they went out into the open fields, outside the crumbling town walls,

RENAISSANCE OR RE BIRTH OF CIVILISATION   THE Renaissance was not a political or religious movement.", "It was a state of mind.", "The men of the Renaissance continued to be the obedient sons of the mother church.", "They were subjects of kings and emperors and dukes and murmured not.", "But their outlook upon life was changed.", "They began to wear different clothes  to speak a different language  to live different lives in different houses.", "They no longer concentrated all their thoughts and their efforts upon the blessed existence that awaited them in Heaven.", "They tried to establish their Paradise upon this planet, and, truth to tell, they succeeded in a remarkable degree.", "I have quite often warned you against the danger that lies in historical dates.", "People take them too literally.", "They think of the Middle Ages as a period of darkness and ignorance.", "\"Click,\" says the clock, and the Renaissance begins and cities and palaces are flooded with the bright sunlight of an eager intellectual curiosity.", "As a matter of fact, it is quite impossible to draw such sharp lines.", "The thirteenth century belonged most decidedly to the Middle Ages.", "All historians agree upon that.", "But was it a time of darkness and stagnation merely?", "By no means.", "People were tremendously alive.", "Great states were being founded.", "Large centres of commerce were being developed.", "High above the turretted towers of the castle and the peaked roof of the town hall, rose the slender spire of the newly built Gothic cathedral.", "Everywhere the world was in motion.", "The high and mighty gentlemen of the city hall, who had just become conscious of their own strength (by way of their recently acquired riches) were struggling for more power with their feudal masters.", "The members of the guilds who had just become aware of the important fact that \"numbers count\" were fighting the high and mighty gentlemen of the city hall.", "The king and his shrewd advisers went fishing in these troubled waters and caught many a shining bass of profit which they proceeded to cook and eat before the noses of the surprised and disappointed councillors and guild brethren.", "To enliven the scenery during the long hours of evening when the badly lighted streets did not invite further political and economic dispute, the Troubadours and Minnesingers told their stories and sang their songs of romance and adventure and heroism and loyalty to all fair women.", "Meanwhile youth, impatient of the slowness of progress, flocked to the universities, and thereby hangs a story.", "The Middle Ages were \"internationally minded.\"", "That sounds difficult, but wait until I explain it to you.", "We modern people are \"nationally minded.\"", "We are Americans or Englishmen or Frenchmen or Italians and speak English or French or Italian and go to English and French and Italian universities, unless we want to specialise in some particular branch of learning which is only taught elsewhere, and then we learn another language and go to Munich or Madrid or Moscow.", "But the people of the thirteenth or fourteenth century rarely talked of themselves as Englishmen or Frenchmen or Italians.", "They said, \"I am a citizen of Sheffield or Bordeaux or Genoa.\"", "Because they all belonged to one and the same church they felt a certain bond of brotherhood.", "And as all educated men could speak Latin, they possessed an international language which removed the stupid language barriers which have grown up in modern Europe and which place the small nations at such an enormous disadvantage.", "Just as an example, take the case of Erasmus, the great preacher of tolerance and laughter, who wrote his books in the sixteenth century.", "He was the native of a small Dutch village.", "He wrote in Latin and all the world was his audience.", "If he were alive to day, he would write in Dutch.", "Then only five or six million people would be able

likely the publishers would never take the trouble or the risk.", "Six hundred years ago that could not happen.", "The greater part of the people were still very ignorant and could not read or write at all.", "But those who had mastered the difficult art of handling the goose quill belonged to an international republic of letters which spread across the entire continent and which knew of no boundaries and respected no limitations of language or nationality.", "The universities were the strongholds of this republic.", "Unlike modern fortifications, they did not follow the frontier.", "They were to be found wherever a teacher and a few pupils happened to find themselves together.", "There again the Middle Ages and the Renaissance differed from our own time.", "Nowadays, when a new university is built, the process (almost invariably) is as follows  Some rich man wants to do something for the community in which he lives or a particular religious sect wants to build a school to keep its faithful children under decent supervision, or a state needs doc tors and lawyers and teachers.", "The university begins as a large sum of money which is deposited in a bank.", "This money is then used to construct buildings and laboratories and dormitories.", "Finally professional teachers are hired, entrance examinations are held and the university is on the way.", "But in the Middle Ages things were done differently.", "A wise man said to himself, \"I have discovered a great truth.", "I must impart my knowledge to others.\"", "And he began to preach his wisdom wherever and whenever he could get a few people to listen to him, like a modern soap box orator.", "If he was an interesting speaker, the crowd came and stayed.", "If he was dull, they shrugged their shoulders and continued their way.", "By and by certain young men began to come regularly to hear the words of wisdom of this great teacher.", "They brought copybooks with them and a little bottle of ink and a goose quill and wrote down what seemed to be important.", "One day it rained.", "The teacher and his pupils retired to an empty basement or the room of the \"Professor.\"", "The learned man sat in his chair and the boys sat on the floor.", "That was the beginning of the University, the \"universitas,\" a corporation of professors and students during the Middle Ages, when the \"teacher\" counted for everything and the building in which he taught counted for very little.", "As an example, let me tell you of something that happened in the ninth century.", "In the town of Salerno near Naples there were a number of excellent physicians.", "They attracted people desirous of learning the medical profession and for almost a thousand years (until 1817) there was a university of Salerno which taught the wisdom of Hippocrates, the great Greek doctor who had practiced his art in ancient Hellas in the fifth century before the birth of Christ.", "Then there was Abelard, the young priest from Brittany, who early in the twelfth century began to lecture on theology and logic in Paris.", "Thousands of eager young men flocked to the French city to hear him.", "Other priests who disagreed with him stepped forward to explain their point of view.", "Paris was soon filled with a clamouring multitude of Englishmen and Germans and Italians and students from Sweden and Hungary and around the old cathedral which stood on a little island in the Seine there grew the famous University of Paris.", "In Bologna in Italy, a monk by the name of Gratian had compiled a text book for those whose business it was to know the laws of the church.", "Young priests and many laymen then came from all over Europe to hear Gratian explain his ideas.", "To protect themselves against the landlords and the innkeepers and the boarding house ladies of the city, they formed a corporation (or University) and behold the beginning of the university of Bologna.", "Next there was a quarrel in the University of Paris.", "We do not know what caused it, but a number of disgruntled teachers together with their pupils crossed the channel and found a hospitable home in a little village on the Thames called Oxford, and in this way the famous University of Oxford came into being.", "In the same way, in the year 1222, there had been a split in the University of Bologna.", "The discontented teachers (again followed by their pupils) had moved to Padua and their proud city thenceforward boasted of a university of its own.", "And so it went from Valladolid in Spain to Cracow in distant Poland and from Poitiers in France to Rostock in Germany.", "It is quite true that much of the teaching done by these early professors would sound absurd to our ears, trained to listen to logarithms and geometrical theorems.", "The point however, which I want to make is this  the Middle Ages and especially the thirteenth century were not a time when the world stood entirely still.", "Among the younger generation, there was life, there was enthusiasm, and there was a restless if somewhat bashful asking of questions.", "And out of this turmoil grew the Renaissance.", "But just before the curtain went down upon the last scene of the Mediaeval world, a solitary figure crossed the stage, of whom you ought to know more than his mere name.", "This man was called Dante.", "He was the son of a Florentine lawyer who belonged to the Alighieri family and he saw the light of day in the year 1265.", "He grew up in the city of his ancestors while Giotto was painting his stories of the life of St.", "Francis of Assisi upon the walls of the Church of the Holy Cross, but often when he went to school, his frightened eyes would see the puddles of blood which told of the terrible and endless warfare that raged forever between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, the followers of the Pope and the adherents of the Emperors.", "When he grew up, he became a Guelph, because his father had been one before him, just as an American boy might become a Democrat or a Republican, simply because his father had happened to be a Democrat or a Republican.", "But after a few years, Dante saw that Italy, unless united under a single head, threatened to perish as a victim of the disordered jealousies of a thousand little cities.", "Then he became a Ghilbeiline.", "He looked for help beyond the Alps.", "He hoped that a mighty emperor might come and re establish unity and order.", "Alas!", "he hoped in vain.", "The Ghibellines were driven out of Florence in the year 1802.", "From that time on until the day of his death amidst the dreary ruins of Ravenna, in the year 1321, Dante was a homeless wanderer, eating the bread of charity at the table of rich patrons whose names would have sunk into the deepest pit of oblivion but for this single fact, that they had been kind to a poet in his misery.", "During the many years of exile, Dante felt compelled to justify himself and his actions when he had been a political leader in his home town, and when he had spent his days walking along the banks of the Arno that he might catch a glimpse of the lovely Beatrice Portinari, who died the wife of another man, a dozen years before the Ghibelline disaster.", "He had failed in the ambitions of his career.", "He had faithfully served the town of is birth and before a corrupt court he had been accused of stealing the public funds and had been condemned to be burned alive should he venture back within the realm of the city of Florence.", "To clear himself before his own conscience and before his contemporaries, Dante then created an Imaginary World and with great detail he described the circumstances which had led to his defeat and depicted the hopeless condition of greed and lust and hatred which had turned his fair and beloved Italy into a battlefield for the pitiless mercenaries of wicked and selfish tyrants.", "He tells us how on the Thursday before Easter of the year 1300 he had lost his way in a dense forest and how he found his path barred by a leopard and a lion and a wolf.", "He gave himself up for lost when a white figure appeared amidst the trees.", "It was Virgil, the Roman poet and philosopher, sent upon his errand of mercy by the Blessed Virgin and by Beatrice, who from high Heaven watched over the fate of her true lover.", "Virgil then takes Dante through Purgatory and through Hell.", "Deeper and deeper the path leads them until they reach the lowest pit where Lucifer himself stands frozen into the eternal ice surrounded by the most terrible of sinners, traitors and liars and those who have achieved fame and success by lies and by deceit.", "But before the two wanderers have reached this terrible spot, Dante has met all those who in some way or other have played a role in the history of his beloved city.", "Emperors and Popes, dashing knights and whining usurers, they are all there, doomed to eternal punishment or awaiting the day of deliverance, when they shall leave Purgatory for Heaven.", "It is a curious story.", "It is a handbook of everything the people of the thirteenth century did and felt and feared and prayed for.", "Through it all moves the figure of the lonely Florentine exile, forever followed by the shadow of his own despair.", "And behold!", "when the gates of death were closing upon the sad poet of the Middle Ages, the portals of life swung open to the child who was to be the first of the men of the Renaissance.", "That was Francesco Petrarca, the son of the notary public of the little town of Arezzo.", "Francesco's father had belonged to the same political party as Dante.", "He too had been exiled and thus it happened that Petrarca (or Petrarch, as we call him) was born away from Florence.", "At the age of fifteen he was sent to Montpellier in France that he might become a lawyer like his father.", "But the boy did not want to be a jurist.", "He hated the law.", "He wanted to be a scholar and a poet  and because he wanted to be a scholar and a poet beyond everything else, he became one, as people of a strong will are apt to do.", "He made long voyages, copying manuscripts in Flanders and in the cloisters along the Rhine and in Paris and Liege and finally in Rome.", "Then he went to live in a lonely valley of the wild mountains of Vaucluse, and there he studied and wrote and soon he had become so famous for his verse and for his learning that both the University of Paris and the king of Naples invited him to come and teach their students and subjects.", "On the way to his new job, he was obliged to pass through Rome.", "The people had heard of his fame as an editor of half forgotten Roman authors.", "They decided to honour him and in the ancient forum of the Imperial City, Petrarch was crowned with the laurel wreath of the Poet.", "From that moment on, his life was an endless career of honour and appreciation.", "He wrote the things which people wanted most to hear.", "They were tired of theological disputations.", "Poor Dante could wander through hell as much as he wanted.", "But Petrarch wrote of love and of nature and the sun and never mentioned those gloomy things which seemed to have been the stock in trade of the last generation.", "And when Petrarch came to a city, all the people flocked out to meet him and he was received like a conquering hero.", "If he happened to bring his young friend Boccaccio, the story teller, with him, so much the better.", "They were both men of their time, full of curiosity, willing to read everything once, digging in forgotten and

seller, announced that Messieurs Diderot, d'Alembert, Turgot and a score of other distinguished writers were going to publish an Encyclopaedia which was to contain \"all the new ideas and the new

shivering men on the dew soaked plains of Italy, made no difference.", "At all times he was master of the situation.", "Even at the end, an exile on a little rock in the middle of the Atlantic, a sick

Vienna twenty four hours he knew that the allies were divided into two hostile camps.", "On the one side were Russia, who wanted to take Poland, and Prussia, who wanted to annex Saxony; and on the other side were Austria and England, who were trying to prevent this grab because it was against their own interest that either Prussia or Russia should be able to dominate Europe.", "Talleyrand

man, Metternich had been studying at the University of Strassburg when the French Revolution broke out.", "Strassburg, the city which gave birth to the Marseillaise, had been a centre of Jacobin

were pleased.", "They even encouraged his plans for a Holy Alliance that he might be fully occupied while they were engaged upon the work at hand.", "Alexander was a sociable person who liked to go to

doctoring of official news, since time immemorial, had been one of the privileges of all civilised governments.", "When the \"edited\" telegram was printed, the good people in Berlin felt that their old and venerable king with his nice white whiskers had been insulted by an arrogant little Frenchman and the equally good people of Paris flew into a rage because their perfectly courteous minister

domestic animals.", "Of course in the very olden days; it was always possible to enslave a weaker neighbour and force him to do the unpleasant tasks of life.", "One of the reasons why the Greeks and Romans, who were quite as intelligent as we are, failed to devise more interesting machinery, was to be found in the wide spread existence of slavery.", "Why should a great mathematician waste his time upon wires and pulleys and cogs and fill the air with noise and smoke when he could go to the marketplace and buy all the slaves he needed at a very small expense?", "And during the middle ages, although slavery had been abolished and only a mild form of serfdom survived, the guilds discouraged the idea of using machinery because they thought this would throw a large number of their brethren out of work.", "Besides, the Middle Ages were not at all interested in producing large quantities of goods.", "Their tailors and butchers and carpenters worked for the immediate needs of the small

haul the coal wagons, but the pumping question demanded the application of special machinery.", "Several inventors were busy trying to solve the difficulty.", "They all knew that steam would have to be used in their new engine.", "The idea of the steam engine was very old.", "Hero of Alexandria, who lived in the first century before Christ, has described to us several bits of machinery which were driven by steam.", "The people of the Renaissance had played with the notion of steam driven war chariots.", "The Marquis of Worcester, a contemporary of Newton, in his book of inventions, tells of a steam engine.", "A little later, in the year 1698, Thomas Savery of London applied for a patent for a pumping engine.", "At the same time, a Hollander, Christian Huygens, was trying to perfect an engine in which gun powder was used to cause regular explosions in much the same way as we use gasoline in our motors.", "All over Europe, people were busy with the idea.", "Denis Papin, a Frenchman, friend and assistant of Huygens, was making experiments with steam engines in several countries.", "He invented a little wagon that was driven by steam, and a paddle wheel boat.", "But when he tried

the four corners of the world.", "During the seventeenth century, the people of Georgia and the Carolinas had begun to grow a new shrub which gave a strange sort of woolly substance, the so called \"cotton wool.\"", "After this had been plucked, it was sent to England and there the people of Lancastershire wove it into cloth.", "This weaving was done by hand and in the homes of the workmen.",

jenny.\"", "Eli Whitney, an American, invented the cotton gin, which separated the cotton from its seeds, a job which had previously been done by hand at the rate of only a pound a day.", "Finally Richard Arkwright and the Reverend Edmund Cartwright invented large weaving machines, which were driven by water power.", "And then, in the eighties of the eighteenth century, just when the Estates General of France had begun those famous meetings which were to revolutionise the political system of Europe, the engines of Watt were arranged in such a way that they could drive the weaving machines of Arkwright, and this created an economic and social revolution which has changed human relationship in almost every part of the world.", "As soon as the stationary engine had proved a success, the inventors turned their attention to the problem of propelling boats and carts with the help of a mechanical contrivance.", "Watt himself designed plans for a \"steam locomotive,\" but ere he had perfected his ideas, in the year 1804, a locomotive made by Richard Trevithick carried a load of twenty tons at Pen y darran in the Wales mining district.", "At the same time an American jeweller and portrait painter by the name of Robert Fulton was in Paris, trying to convince Napoleon that with the use of his submarine boat, the \"Nautilus,\" and his \"steam boat,\" the French might be able to destroy the naval supremacy of England.", "Fulton's idea of a steamboat was not original.", "He had undoubtedly copied it from John Fitch, a mechanical genius of Connecticut whose cleverly constructed steamer had first navigated the Delaware river as early as the year 1787.", "But Napoleon and his scientific advisers did not believe in the practical possibility of a self propelled boat, and although the Scotch built engine of the little craft puffed merrily on the Seine, the great Emperor neglected to avail himself of this formidable weapon which might have given him his revenge for Trafalgar.", "As for Fulton, he returned to the United States and, being a practical man of business, he organised a successful steamboat company together with Robert R. Livingston, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, who was American Minister to France when Fulton was in Paris, trying to sell his invention.", "The first steamer of this new company, the \"Clermont,\" which was given a monopoly of all the waters of New York State, equipped with an engine built by Boulton and Watt of Birmingham in England, began a regular service between New York and Albany in the year 1807.", "As for poor John Fitch, the man who long before any one else had used the \"steam boat\" for commercial purposes, he came to a sad death.", "Broken in health and empty of purse, he had come to the end of his resources when his fifth boat, which was propelled by means of a screw propeller, had been destroyed.", "His neighbours jeered at him as they were to laugh a hundred years later when Professor Langley constructed his funny flying machines.", "Fitch had hoped to give his country an easy access to the broad rivers of the west and his countrymen preferred to travel in flat boats or go on foot.", "In the year 1798, in utter despair and misery, Fitch killed himself by taking poison.", "But twenty years later, the \"Savannah,\" a steamer of 1850 tons and making six knots an hour, (the Mauretania goes just four times as fast,) crossed the ocean from Savannah to Liverpool in the record time of twenty five days.", "Then there was an end to the derision of the multitude and in their enthusiasm the people gave the credit for the invention to the wrong man.", "Six years later, George Stephenson, a Scotchman, who had been building locomotives for the purpose of hauling coal from the mine pit to smelting ovens and cotton factories, built his famous \"travelling engine\" which reduced the price of coal by almost seventy per cent and which made it possible to establish the first regular passenger service between Manchester and Liverpool, when people were whisked from city to city at the unheard of speed of fifteen miles per hour.", "A dozen years later, this speed had been increased to twenty miles per hour.", "At the present time, any well behaved flivver (the direct descendant of the puny little motor driven machines of Daimler and Levassor of the eighties of the last century) can do better than these early \"Puffing Billies.\"", "But while these practically minded engineers were improving upon their rattling \"heat engines,\" a group of \"pure\" scientists (men who devote fourteen hours of each day to the study of those \"theoretical\" scientific phenomena without which no mechanical progress would be possible) were following a new scent which promised to lead them into the most secret and hidden domains of Nature.", "Two thousand years ago, a number of Greek and Roman philosophers (notably Thales of Miletus and Pliny who was killed while trying to study the eruption of Vesuvius of the year 79 when Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried beneath the ashes) had noticed the strange antics of bits of straw and of feather which were held near a piece of amber which was being rubbed with a bit of wool.", "The schoolmen of the Middle Ages had not been interested in this mysterious \"electric\" power.", "But

von Guericke, the burgomaster of Magdeburg and the inventor of the air pump, constructed the first electrical machine.", "During the next century a large number of scientists devoted themselves to the study of electricity.", "Not less than three professors invented the famous Leyden Jar in the year 1795.", "At the same time, Benjamin Franklin, the most universal genius of America next to Benjamin Thomson (who after his flight from New Hampshire on account of his pro British sympathies became known as Count Rumford) was devoting his attention to this subject.", "He discovered that lightning and the electric spark were manifestations of the same electric power and continued his electric studies until the end of his busy and useful life.", "Then came Volta with his famous \"electric pile\" and Galvani and Day and the Danish professor Hans Christian Oersted and Ampere and Arago and Faraday, all of them diligent searchers after the true nature of the electric forces.", "They freely gave their discoveries to the world and Samuel Morse (who like Fulton began his career as an artist) thought that he could use this new electric current to transmit messages from one city to another.", "He intended to use copper wire and a little machine which he had invented.", "People laughed at him.", "Morse therefore was obliged to finance his own experiments and soon he had spent all his money and then he was very poor and people laughed even louder.", "He then asked Congress to help him and a special Committee on Commerce promised him their support.", "But the members of Congress were not at all interested and Morse had to wait twelve years before he was given a small congressional appropriation.", "He then built a \"telegraph\" between Baltimore and Washington.", "In the year 1887 he had shown his first successful \"telegraph\" in one of the lecture halls of New York University.", "Finally, on the 24th of May of the year 1844 the first long distance message was sent from Washington to Baltimore and to day the whole world is covered with telegraph wires and we can send news from Europe to Asia in a few seconds.", "Twenty three years later Alexander Graham Bell used the electric current for his telephone.", "And half a century afterwards Marconi improved upon these ideas by inventing a system of sending messages which did away entirely with the old fashioned wires.", "While Morse, the New Englander, was working on his \"telegraph,\" Michael Faraday, the Yorkshire man, had constructed the first \"dynamo.\"", "This tiny little machine was completed in the year 1881 when Europe was still trembling as a result of the great July revolutions which had so severely upset the plans of the Congress of Vienna.", "The first dynamo grew and grew and grew and to day it provides us with heat and with light (you know the little incandescent bulbs which Edison, building upon French and English experiments of the forties and fifties, first made in 1878) and with power for all sorts of machines.", "If I am not mistaken the electric engine will soon entirely drive out the \"heat engine\" just as in the olden days the more highly organised prehistoric animals drove out their less efficient neighbours.", "Personally (but I know nothing about machinery) this will make me very happy.", "For the electric engine which can be run by waterpower is a clean and companionable servant of mankind but the \"heat engine,\" the marvel of the eighteenth century, is a noisy and dirty creature for ever filling the world with ridiculous smoke stacks and with dust and soot and asking that it be fed with coal which has to be dug out of mines at great inconvenience and risk to thousands of people.", "And if I were a novelist and not a historian, who must stick to facts and may not use his imagination, I would describe the happy day when the last steam locomotive shall be taken to the Museum of Natural History to be placed next to the skeleton of the Dynosaur and the Pteredactyl and the other extinct creatures of a by gone age.", "THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION  BUT THE NEW ENGINES WERE VERY EXPENSIVE AND ONLY PEOPLE OF WEALTH COULD AFFORD THEM.", "THE OLD CARPENTER OR

INDEPENDENCE AND HE DID NOT LIKE THAT   IN the olden days the work of the world had been done by independent workmen who sat in their own little workshops in the front of their houses, who owned their tools, who boxed the ears of their own apprentices and who, within the limits prescribed by their guilds, conducted their business as it pleased them.", "They lived simple lives, and were obliged to work very long hours, but they were their own masters.", "If they got up and saw that it was a fine day to go fishing, they went fishing and there was no one to say \"no.\"", "But the introduction of machinery changed this.", "A machine is really nothing but a greatly enlarged tool.", "A railroad train which carries you at the speed of a mile a minute is in reality a pair of very fast legs, and a steam hammer which flattens heavy plates of iron is just a terrible big fist, made of steel.", "But whereas we can all afford a pair of good legs and a good strong fist, a railroad train and a steam hammer and a cotton factory are very expensive pieces of machinery and they are not owned by a single man, but usually by a company of people who all contribute a certain sum and then divide the profits of their railroad or cotton mill according to the amount of money which they have invested.", "Therefore, when machines had been improved until they were really practicable and profitable, the builders of those large tools, the machine manufacturers, began to look for customers who could afford to pay for them in cash.", "During the early middle ages, when land had been almost the only form of wealth, the nobility were the only people who were considered wealthy.", "But as I have told you in a previous chapter, the gold and silver which they possessed was quite insignificant and they used the old system of barter, exchanging cows for horses and eggs for honey.", "During the crusades, the burghers of the cities had been able to gather riches from the reviving trade between the east and the west, and they had been serious rivals of the lords and the knights.", "The French revolution had entirely destroyed the wealth of the nobility and had enormously increased that of the middle

valuable land, and during the Napoleonic wars, they had used their capital to \"profiteer\" in grain and gun powder, and now they possessed more wealth than they needed for the actual expenses of their households, and they could afford to build themselves factories and to hire men and women to work the machines.", "This caused a very abrupt change in the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.", "Within a few years, many cities doubled the number of their inhabitants and the old civic centre which had been the real \"home\" of the citizens was surrounded with ugly and cheaply built suburbs where the workmen slept after their eleven or twelve hours, or thirteen hours, spent in the factories and from where they returned to the factory as soon as the whistle blew.", "Far and wide through the countryside there was talk of the fabulous sums of money that could be made in the towns.", "The peasant boy, accustomed to a life in the open, went to the city.", "He rapidly lost his old health amidst the smoke and dust and dirt of those early and badly ventilated workshops, and the end, very often, was death in the poor house or in the hospital.", "Of course the change from the farm to the factory on the part of so many people was not accomplished without a certain amount of opposition.", "Since one engine could do as much work as a hundred men, the ninety nine others who were thrown out of employment did not like it.", "Frequently they attacked the factory buildings and set fire to the machines, but Insurance Companies had been organised as early as the 17th century and as a rule the owners were well protected against loss.", "Soon, newer and better machines were installed, the factory was surrounded with a high wall and then there was an end to the rioting.", "The ancient guilds could not possibly survive in this new world of steam and iron.", "They went out of existence and then the workmen tried to organise regular labour unions.", "But the factory owners, who through their wealth could exercise great influence upon the politicians of the different countries, went to the Legislature and had laws passed which forbade the forming of such trade unions because they interfered with the \"liberty of action\" of the working man.", "Please do not think that the good members of Parliament who passed these laws were wicked tyrants.", "They were the true sons of the revolutionary period when everybody talked of \"liberty\" and when people often killed their neighbours because they were not quite as liberty loving as they ought to have been.", "Since \"liberty\" was the foremost virtue of man, it was not right that labour unions should dictate to their members the hours during which they could work and the wages which they must demand.", "The

course.", "The last half of the 18th century had not merely been a time of intellectual and political doubt, but the old economic ideas, too, had been replaced by new ones which better suited the need of the hour.", "Several years before the French revolution, Turgot, who had been one of the unsuccessful ministers of finance of Louis XVI, had preached the novel doctrine of \"economic liberty.\"",

government of most European countries.", "In England, where the members of Parliament were still elected according to a Royal Decree of the year 1265, and where a large number of recently created industrial centres were without representation, they brought about the passing of the Reform Bill of the year 1882, which changed the electoral system and gave the class of the factory owners more influence upon the legislative body.", "This however caused great discontent among the millions of factory workers, who were left without any voice in the government.", "They too began an agitation for the right to vote.", "They put their demands down in a document which came to be known as the \"People's Charter.\"", "The debates about this charter grew more and more violent.", "They had not

gin at very cheap rates.", "The enormous improvement which has taken place since the thirties and the forties of the last century is not due to the efforts of a single man.", "The best brains of two generations devoted themselves to the task of saving the world from the disastrous results of the all too sudden introduction of machinery.", "They did not try to destroy the capitalistic system.", "This would have been very foolish, for the accumulated wealth of other people, when intelligently used, may be of very great benefit to all mankind.", "But they tried to combat the notion that true equality can exist between the man who has wealth and owns the factories and can close their doors at will without the risk of going hungry, and the labourer who must take whatever job is offered, at whatever wage he can get, or face the risk of starvation for himself, his wife and his children.", "They endeavoured to introduce a number of laws which regulated the relations between the factory owners and the factory workers.", "In this, the reformers have been increasingly successful in all countries.", "To day, the majority of the labourers are well protected; their hours are being reduced to the excellent average of eight, and their children are sent to the schools instead of to the mine pit and to the carding room of the cotton mills.", "But there were other men who also contemplated the sight of all the belching smoke stacks, who heard the rattle of the railroad trains, who saw the store houses filled with a surplus of all sorts of materials, and who wondered to what ultimate goal this tremendous activity would lead in the years to come.", "They remembered that the human race had lived for hundreds of thousands of years without commercial and industrial competition.", "Could they change the existing order of things and do away with a system of rivalry which so often sacrificed human happiness to profits?", "This idea  this vague hope for a better day  was not restricted to a single country.", "In England, Robert Owen, the owner of many cotton mills, established a so called \"socialistic community\" which was a success.", "But when he died, the prosperity of New Lanark came to an end and an attempt of Louis Blanc, a French journalist, to establish \"social workshops\" all over France fared no better.", "Indeed, the increasing number of socialistic writers soon began to see that little individual communities which remained outside of the regular industrial life, would never be able to accomplish anything at all.", "It was necessary to study the fundamental principles underlying the whole industrial and capitalistic society before useful remedies could be suggested.", "The practical socialists like Robert Owen and Louis Blanc and Francois Fournier were succeeded by theoretical students of socialism like Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.", "Of these two, Marx is the best known.", "He was a very brilliant Jew whose family had for a long time lived in Germany.", "He had heard of the experiments of Owen and Blanc and he began to interest himself in questions of labour and wages and unemployment.", "But his liberal views made him very unpopular with the police authorities of Germany, and he was forced to flee to Brussels and then to London, where he lived a poor and shabby life as the correspondent of the New York Tribune.", "No one, thus far, had paid much attention to his books on economic subjects.", "But in the year 1864 he organised the first international association of working men and three years later in 1867, he published the first volume of his well known treatise called \"Capital.\"", "Marx believed that all history was a long struggle between those who \"have\" and those who \"don't have.\"", "The introduction and general use of machinery had created a new class in society, that of the capitalists who used their surplus wealth to buy the tools which were then used by the labourers to produce still more wealth, which was again used to build more factories and so on, until the end of time.", "Meanwhile, according to Marx, the third estate (the bourgeoisie) was growing richer and richer and the fourth estate (the proletariat) was growing poorer and poorer, and he predicted that in the end, one man would possess all the wealth of the world while the others would be his employees and dependent upon his good will.", "To prevent such a state of affairs, Marx advised working men of all countries to unite and to fight for a number of political and economic measures which he had enumerated in a Manifesto in the year 1848, the year of the last great European revolution.", "These views of course were very unpopular with the governments of Europe, many countries, especially Prussia, passed severe laws against the Socialists and policemen were ordered to break up the Socialist meetings and to arrest the speakers.", "But that sort of persecution never does any good.", "Martyrs are the best possible advertisements for an unpopular cause.", "In Europe the number of socialists steadily increased and it was soon clear that the Socialists did not contemplate a violent revolution but were using their increasing power in the different Parliaments to promote the interests of the labouring classes.", "Socialists were even called upon to act as Cabinet Ministers, and they co operated with progressive Catholics and Protestants to undo the damage that had been caused by the Industrial Revolution and to bring about a fairer division of the many benefits which had followed the introduction of machinery and the increased production of wealth.", "THE AGE OF SCIENCE  BUT THE WORLD HAD UNDERGONE ANOTHER CHANGE WHICH WAS OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN EITHER THE POLITICAL OR THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONS.", "AFTER GENERATIONS OF OPPRESSION AND PERSECUTION, THE SCIENTIST HAD AT LAST GAINED LIBERTY OF ACTION AND HE WAS NOW TRYING TO DISCOVER THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS WHICH GOVERN THE UNIVERSE   THE Egyptians, the Babylonians, the Chaldeans, the Greeks and the Romans, had all contributed something to the first vague notions of science and scientific investigation.", "But the great migrations of the fourth century had destroyed the classical world of the Mediterranean, and the Christian Church, which was more interested in the life of the soul than in the life of the body, had regarded science as a manifestation of that human arrogance which wanted to pry into divine affairs which belonged to the realm of Almighty God, and which therefore was closely related to the seven deadly sins.", "The Renaissance to a certain but limited extent had broken through this wall of Mediaeval prejudices.", "The Reformation, however, which had overtaken the Renaissance in the early 16th century, had been hostile to the ideals of the \"new civilisation,\" and once more the men of science were threatened with severe punishment, should they try to pass beyond the narrow limits of knowledge which had been laid down in Holy Writ.", "Our world is filled with the statues of great generals, atop of prancing horses, leading their cheering soldiers to glorious victory.", "Here and there, a modest slab of marble announces that a man of science has found his final resting place.", "A thousand years from now we shall probably do these things differently, and the children of that happy generation shall know of the splendid courage and the almost inconceivable devotion to duty of the men who were the pioneers of that abstract knowledge, which alone has made our modern world a practical possibility.", "Many of these scientific pioneers suffered poverty and contempt and humiliation.", "They lived in garrets and died in dungeons.", "They dared not print their names on the title pages of their books and they dared not print their conclusions in the land of their birth, but smuggled the manuscripts to some secret printing shop in Amsterdam or Haarlem.", "They were exposed to the bitter enmity of the Church, both Protestant and Catholic, and were the subjects of endless sermons, inciting the parishioners to violence against the \"heretics.\"", "Here and there they found an asylum.", "In Holland, where the spirit of tolerance was strongest, the authorities, while regarding these scientific investigations with little favour, yet refused to interfere with people's freedom of thought.", "It became a little asylum for intellectual liberty where French and English and German philosophers and mathematicians and physicians could go to enjoy a short spell of rest and get a breath of free air.", "In another chapter I have told you how Roger Bacon, the great genius of the thirteenth century, was prevented for years from writing a single word, lest he get into new troubles with the authorities of the church.", "And five hundred years later, the contributors to the great philosophic \"Encyclopaedia\" were under the constant supervision of the French gendarmerie.", "Half a century afterwards, Darwin, who dared to question the story of the creation of man, as revealed in the Bible, was denounced from every pulpit

done invariably gets done, and the ultimate profit of the discoveries and the inventions goes to the mass of those same people who have always decried the man of vision as an unpractical idealist.", "The seventeenth century had still preferred to investigate the far off heavens and to study the position of our planet in relation to the solar system.", "Even so, the Church had disapproved of this unseemly curiosity, and Copernicus who first of all had proved that the sun was the centre of the universe, did not publish his work until the day of his death.", "Galileo spent the greater part of his life under the supervision of the clerical authorities, but he continued to use his telescope and provided Isaac Newton with a mass of practical observations, which greatly helped the English mathematician when he dis covered the existence of that interesting habit of falling objects which came to be known as the Law of Gravitation.", "That, for the moment at least, exhausted the interest in the Heavens, and man began to study the earth.", "The invention of a workable microscope, (a strange and clumsy little thing,) by Anthony van Leeuwenhoek during the last half of the 17th century, gave man a chance to study the \"microscopic\" creatures who are responsible for so many of his ailments.", "It laid the foundations of the science of \"bacteriology\" which in the last forty years has delivered the world from a great number of diseases by discovering the tiny organisms which cause the complaint.", "It also allowed the geologists to make a more careful study of different rocks and of the fossils (the petrified prehistoric plants) which they found deep below the surface of the earth.", "These investigations convinced them that the earth must be a great deal older than was stated in the book of Genesis and in the year 1830, Sir Charles Lyell published his \"Principles of Geology\" which denied the story of creation as related in the Bible and gave a far more wonderful description of slow growth and gradual development.", "At the same time, the Marquis de Laplace was working on a new theory of creation, which made the earth a little blotch in the nebulous sea out of which the planetary system had been formed and Bunsen and Kirchhoff, by the use of the spectroscope, were investigating the chemical composition of the stars and of our good neighbour, the sun, whose curious spots had first been noticed by Galileo.", "Meanwhile after a most bitter and relentless warfare with the clerical authorities of Catholic and Protestant lands, the anatomists and physiologists had at last obtained permission to dissect bodies and to substitute a positive knowledge of our organs and their habits for the guesswork of the mediaeval quack.", "Within a single generation (between 1810 and 1840) more progress was made in every branch of science than in all the hundreds of thousands of years that had passed since man first looked at the stars and wondered why they were there.", "It must have been a very sad age for the people who had been educated under the old system.", "And we can understand their feeling of hatred for such men as Lamarck and Darwin, who did not exactly tell them that they were \"descended from monkeys,\" (an accusation which our grandfathers seemed to regard as a personal insult,) but who suggested that the proud human race had evolved from a long series of ancestors who could trace the family tree back to the little jelly fishes who were the first inhabitants of our planet.", "The dignified world of the well to do middle class, which dominated the nineteenth century, was willing to make use of the gas or the electric light, of all the many practical applications of the great scientific discoveries, but the mere investigator, the man of the \"scientific theory\" without whom no progress would be possible, continued to be distrusted until very recently.", "Then, at last, his services were recognised.", "Today

hunted, and out of a piece of stone, he hacked the rough figures of those women he thought most attractive.", "As soon as the Egyptians and the Babylonians and the Persians and all the other people of

had brought with him from the east, had developed into something very beautiful and he made up for his past neglect and indifference by the so called \"art of the Middle Ages\" which as far as northern Europe is concerned was a product of the Germanic mind and had borrowed but little from the Greeks and the Latins and nothing at all from the older forms of art of Egypt and Assyria, not to speak of India and China, which simply did not exist, as far as the people of that time were concerned.", "Indeed, so little had the northern races been influenced by their southern neighbours that their own architectural products were completely misunderstood by the people of Italy and were treated by them with downright and unmitigated contempt.", "You have all heard the word Gothic.", "You probably associate it with the picture of a lovely old cathedral, lifting its slender spires towards high heaven.", "But what does the word really mean?", "It means something \"uncouth\" and \"barbaric\"  something which one might expect from an \"uncivilised Goth,\" a rough backwoods man who had no respect for the established rules of classical art and who built his \"modern horrors\" to please his own low tastes without a decent regard for the examples of the Forum and the Acropolis.", "And yet for several centuries this form of Gothic architecture was the highest expression of the sincere feeling for art which inspired the whole northern continent.", "From a previous chapter, you will remember how the people of the late Middle Ages lived.", "Unless they were peasants and dwelt in villages, they were citizens of a \"city\" or \"civitas,\" the old Latin name for a tribe.", "And indeed, behind their high walls and their deep moats, these good burghers were true tribesmen who shared the common dangers and enjoyed the common safety and prosperity which they derived from their system of mutual protection.", "In the old Greek and Roman cities the market place, where the temple stood, had been the centre of civic life.", "During the Middle Ages, the Church, the House of God, became such a centre.", "We modern Protestant people, who go to our church only once a week,

necessary that the interior offer space for a great multitude.", "All the religious processions of the old Mediterranean peoples took place in the open.", "But in the north, where the weather was usually bad, most functions were held under the roof of the church.", "During many centuries the architects struggled with this problem of constructing a building that was large enough.", "The Roman tradition taught them how to build heavy stone walls with very small windows lest the walls lose their strength.", "On the top of this they then placed a heavy stone roof.", "But in the twelfth century, after the beginning of the Crusades, when the architects had seen the pointed arches of the Mohammedan builders, the western builders discovered a new style which gave them their first chance to make the sort of building which those days of an intense religious life demanded.", "And then they developed this strange style upon which the Italians bestowed the contemptuous name of \"Gothic\" or barbaric.", "They achieved their purpose by inventing a vaulted roof which was supported by \"ribs.\"", "But such a roof, if it became too heavy, was apt to break the walls, just as a man of three hundred pounds sitting down upon a child's chair will force it to collapse.", "To overcome this difficulty, certain French architects then began to re enforce the walls with \"buttresses\" which were merely heavy masses of stone against which the walls could lean while they supported the roof.", "And to assure the further safety of the roof they supported the ribs of the roof by so called \"flying buttresses,\" a very simple method of construction which you will understand at once when you look at our picture.", "This new method of construction allowed the introduction of enormous windows.", "In the twelfth century, glass was still an expensive curiosity, and very few private buildings possessed glass windows.", "Even the castles of the nobles were without protection and this accounts for the eternal drafts and explains why people of that day wore furs in doors as well as out.", "Fortunately, the art of making coloured glass, with which the ancient people of the Mediterranean had been familiar, had not been entirely lost.", "There was a revival of stained glass making and soon the windows of the Gothic churches told the stories of the Holy Book in little bits of brilliantly coloured window pane, which were caught in a long framework of lead.", "Behold, therefore, the new and glorious house of God, filled with an eager multitude, \"living\" its religion as no people have ever done either before or since!", "Nothing is considered too good or too costly or too wondrous for this House of God and Home of Man.", "The sculptors, who since the destruction of the Roman Empire

his best.", "Poor man, he is greatly handicapped by lack of a suitable medium.", "And thereby hangs a story.", "The Romans of the early Christian period had covered the floors and the walls of their temples and houses with mosaics; pictures made of coloured bits of glass.", "But this art had been exceedingly difficult.", "It gave the painter no chance to express all he wanted to say, as all children know who have ever tried to make figures out of coloured blocks of wood.", "The art of mosaic painting therefore died out during the late Middle Ages except in Russia, where the Byzantine mosaic painters had found a refuge after the fall of Constantinople and continued to ornament the walls of the orthodox churches until the day of the Bolsheviki, when there was an end to the building of churches.", "Of course, the mediaeval painter could mix his colours with the water of the wet plaster which was put upon the walls of the churches.", "This method of painting upon \"fresh plaster\" (which was generally called \"fresco\" or \"fresh\" painting) was very popular for many centuries.", "To day, it is as rare as the art of painting miniatures in manuscripts and among the hundreds of artists of our modern cities there is perhaps one who can handle this medium successfully.", "But during the Middle Ages there was no other way and the artists were \"fresco\" workers for lack of something better.", "The method however had certain great disadvantages.", "Very often the plaster came off the walls after only a few years, or dampness spoiled the pictures, just as dampness will spoil the pattern of our wall paper.", "People tried every imaginable expedient to get away from this plaster background.", "They tried to mix their colours with wine and vinegar and with honey and with the sticky white of egg, but none of these methods were satisfactory.", "For more than a thousand years these experiments continued.", "In painting pictures upon the parchment leaves of manuscripts the mediaeval artists were very successful.", "But when it came to covering large spaces of wood or stone with paint which would stick, they did not succeed very well.", "At last, during the first half of the fifteenth century, the problem was solved in the southern Netherlands by Jan and Hubert van Eyck.", "The famous Flemish brothers mixed their paint with specially prepared oils and this allowed them to use wood and canvas or stone or anything else as a background for their pictures.", "But by this time the religious ardour of the early Middle Ages was a thing of the past.", "The rich burghers of the cities were succeeding the bishops as patrons of the arts.", "And as art invariably follows the full dinner pail, the artists now began to work for these worldly employers and painted pictures for kings, for grand dukes and for rich bankers.", "Within a very short time, the new method of painting with oil spread through Europe and in every country there developed a school of special painting which showed the characteristic tastes of the people for whom these portraits and landscapes were made.", "In Spain, for example, Velasquez painted court dwarfs and the weavers of the royal tapestry factories, and all sorts of persons and subjects connected with the king and his court.", "But in Holland, Rembrandt and Frans Hals and Vermeer painted the barnyard of the merchant's house, and they painted his rather dowdy wife and his healthy but bumptious children and the ships which had brought him his wealth.", "In Italy on the other hand, where the Pope remained the largest patron of the arts, Michelangelo and Correggio continued to paint Madonnas and Saints, while in England, where the aristocracy was very rich and powerful and in France where the kings had become uppermost in the state, the artists painted distinguished gentlemen who were members of the government, and very lovely ladies who were friends of His Majesty.", "The great change in painting, which came about with the neglect of the old church and the rise of a new class in society, was reflected in all other forms of art.", "The invention of printing had made it possible for authors to win fame and reputation by writing books for the multitudes.", "In this way arose the profession of the novelist and the illustrator.", "But the people who had money enough to buy the new books were not the sort who liked to sit at home of nights, looking at the ceiling or just sitting.", "They wanted to be amused.", "The few minstrels of the Middle Ages were not sufficient to cover the demand for entertainment.", "For the first time since the early Greek city states of two thousand years before, the professional playwright had a chance to ply his trade.", "The Middle Ages had known the theatre merely as part of certain church celebrations.", "The tragedies of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries had told the story of the suffering of our Lord.", "But during the sixteenth century the worldly theatre made its reappearance.", "It is true that, at first, the position of the professional playwright and actor was not a very high one.", "William Shakespeare was regarded as a sort of circus fellow who amused his neighbours with his tragedies and comedies.", "But when he died in the year 1616 he had begun to enjoy the respect of his neighbours and actors were no longer subjects of police supervision.", "William's contemporary, Lope de Vega, the incredible Spaniard who wrote no less than 1800 worldly and 400 religious plays, was a person of rank who received the papal approval upon his work.", "A century later, Moliere, the Frenchman, was deemed worthy of the companionship of none less than King Louis XIV.", "Since then, the theatre has enjoyed an ever increasing affection on the part of the people.", "To day a \"theatre\" is part of every well regulated city, and the \"silent drama\" of the movies has penetrated to the tiniest of our prairie hamlets.", "Another art, however, was to become the most popular of all.", "That was music.", "Most of the old art forms demanded a great deal of technical skill.", "It takes years and years of practice before our clumsy hand is able to follow the commands of the brain and reproduce our vision upon canvas or in marble.", "It takes a life time to learn how to act or how to write a good novel.", "And it takes a great deal of training on the part of the public to appreciate the best in painting and writing and sculpture.", "But almost any one, not entirely tone deaf, can follow a tune and almost everybody can get enjoyment out of some sort of music.", "The Middle Ages had heard a little music but it had been entirely the music of the church.", "The holy chants were subject to very severe laws of rhythm and harmony and soon these became monotonous.", "Besides, they could not well be sung in the street or in the market place.", "The Renaissance changed this.", "Music once more came into its own as the best friend of man, both in his happiness and in his sorrows.", "The Egyptians and the Babylonians and the ancient Jews had all been great lovers of music.", "They had even combined different instruments into regular orchestras.", "But the Greeks had frowned upon this barbaric foreign noise.", "They liked to hear a man recite the stately poetry of Homer and Pindar.", "They allowed him to accompany himself upon the lyre (the poorest of all stringed instruments).", "That was as far as any one could go without incurring the risk of popular disapproval.", "The Romans on the other hand had loved orchestral music at their dinners and parties and they had invented most of the instruments which (in VERY modified form) we use to day.", "The early church had despised this music which smacked too much of the wicked pagan world which had just been destroyed.", "A few songs rendered by the entire congregation were all the bishops of the third and fourth centuries would tolerate.", "As the congregation was apt to sing dreadfully out of key without the guidance of an instrument, the church had afterwards allowed the use of an organ, an invention of the second century of our era which consisted of a combination of the old pipes of Pan and a pair of bellows.", "Then came the great migrations.", "The last of the Roman musicians were either killed or became tramp fiddlers going from city to city and playing in the street, and begging for pennies like the harpist on a modern ferry boat.", "But the revival of a more worldly civilisation in the cities of the late Middle Ages had created a new demand for musicians.", "Instruments like the horn, which had been used only as signal instruments for hunting and fighting, were remodelled until they could reproduce sounds which were agreeable in the dance hall and in the banqueting room.", "A bow strung with horse hair was used to play the old fashioned guitar and before the end of the Middle Ages this six stringed instrument (the most ancient of all string instruments which dates back to Egypt and Assyria) had grown into our modern four stringed fiddle which Stradivarius and the other Italian violin makers of the eighteenth century brought to the height of perfection.", "And finally the modern piano was invented, the most wide spread of all musical instruments, which has followed man into the wilderness of the jungle and the ice fields of Greenland.", "The organ had been the first of all keyed instruments but the performer always depended upon the co operation of some one who worked the bellows, a job which nowadays is done by electricity.", "The musicians therefore looked for a handier and less circumstantial instrument to assist them in training the pupils of the many church choirs.", "During the great eleventh century, Guido, a Benedictine monk of the town of Arezzo (the birthplace of the poet Petrarch) gave us our modern system of musical annotation.", "Some time during that century, when there was a great deal of popular interest in music, the first instrument with both keys and strings was built.", "It must have sounded as tinkly as one of those tiny children's pianos which you can buy at every toy shop.", "In the city of Vienna, the town where the strolling musicians of the Middle Ages (who had been classed with jugglers and card sharps) had formed the first separate Guild of Musicians in the year 1288, the little monochord was developed into something which we can recognise as the direct ancestor of our modern Steinway.", "From Austria the \"clavichord\" as it was usually called in those days (because it had \"craves\" or keys) went to Italy.", "There it was perfected into the \"spinet\" which was so called after the inventor, Giovanni Spinetti of Venice.", "At last during the eighteenth century, some time between 1709 and 1720, Bartolomeo Cristofori made a \"clavier\" which allowed the performer to play both loudly and softly or as it was said in Italian, \"piano\" and \"forte.\"", "This instrument with certain changes became our \"pianoforte\" or piano.", "Then for the first time the world possessed an easy and convenient instrument which could be mastered in a couple of years and did not need the eternal tuning of harps and fiddles and was much pleasanter to the ears than the mediaeval tubas, clarinets, trombones and oboes.", "Just as the phonograph has given millions of modern people their first love of music so did the early \"pianoforte\" carry the knowledge of music into much wider circles.", "Music became

greatest hopes and remotest aims.", "My brother had the figure of Zarathustra in his mind from his very earliest youth  he once told me that even as a child he had dreamt of him.", "At different periods in his life, he would call this haunter of his dreams by different names; but in the end, he declares in a note on the subject, I had to do a PERSIAN the honour of identifying him with this creature of my fancy.", "Persians were the first to take a broad and comprehensive view of history.", "Every series of evolutions, according to them, was presided over by a prophet; and every prophet had his ‘Hazar,’  his dynasty of a thousand years.  All Zarathustra’s views, as also his personality, were early conceptions of my brother’s mind.", "Whoever reads his posthumously published writings for the years 1869 82 with care, will constantly meet with passages suggestive of Zarathustra’s thoughts and doctrines.", "For instance, the ideal of the Superman is put forth quite clearly in all his writings during the years 1873 75; and in We Philologists, the following remarkable observations occur     How can one praise and glorify a nation as a whole?

The notion of rearing the Superman is only a new form of an ideal Nietzsche already had in his youth, that THE OBJECT OF MANKIND SHOULD LIE IN ITS HIGHEST INDIVIDUALS (or, as he writes in Schopenhauer as Educator  Mankind ought constantly to be striving to produce great men  this and nothing else is its duty.) But the ideals he most revered in those days are no longer held to be the highest types of men.", "No, around this future ideal of a coming humanity  the Superman  the poet spread the veil of becoming.", "Who can tell to what glorious heights man can still ascend?", "That is why, after having tested the worth of our noblest ideal  that of the Saviour, in the light of the new valuations, the poet cries with passionate emphasis in Zarathustra   Never yet hath there been a Superman.", "Naked have I seen both of them, the greatest and the smallest man     All too similar are they still to each other.", "Verily even the greatest found I  all too human!    The phrase the rearing of the Superman, has very often been misunderstood.", "By the word rearing, in this case, is meant the act of modifying by means of new and higher values  values which, as laws and guides of conduct and opinion, are now to rule over mankind.", "In general the doctrine of the Superman can only be understood correctly in conjunction with other ideas of the author’s, such as   the Order of Rank, the Will to Power, and the Transvaluation of all Values.", "He assumes that Christianity, as a product of the resentment of the botched and the weak, has put in ban all that is beautiful, strong, proud, and powerful, in fact all the qualities resulting from strength, and that, in consequence, all forces which tend to promote or elevate life have been seriously undermined.", "Now, however, a new table of valuations must be placed over mankind  namely, that of the strong, mighty, and magnificent man, overflowing with life and elevated to his zenith  the Superman, who is now put before us with overpowering passion as the aim of our life, hope, and will.", "And just as the old system of valuing, which only extolled the qualities favourable to the weak, the suffering, and the oppressed, has succeeded in producing a weak, suffering, and modern race, so this new and reversed system of valuing ought to rear a healthy, strong, lively, and courageous type, which would be a glory to life itself.", "Stated briefly, the leading principle of this new system of valuing would be  All that proceeds from power is good, all that springs from weakness is bad.  This type must not be regarded as a fanciful figure  it is not a nebulous hope which is to be realised at some indefinitely remote period, thousands of years hence; nor is it a new species (in the Darwinian sense) of which we can know nothing, and which it would therefore be somewhat absurd to strive after.", "But it is meant to be a possibility which men of the present could realise with all their spiritual and physical energies, provided they adopted the new values.", "The author of Zarathustra never lost sight of that egregious example of a transvaluation of all values through Christianity, whereby the whole of the deified mode of life and thought of the Greeks, as well as strong Romedom, was almost annihilated or transvalued in a comparatively short time.", "Could not a rejuvenated Graeco Roman system of valuing (once it had been refined and made more profound by the schooling which two thousand years of Christianity had provided) effect another such revolution within a calculable period of time, until that glorious type of manhood shall finally appear which is to be our new faith and hope, and in the creation of which Zarathustra exhorts us to participate?", "In his private notes on the subject the author uses the expression Superman (always in the singular, by the bye), as signifying the most thoroughly well constituted type, as opposed to modern man; above all, however, he designates Zarathustra himself as an example of the Superman.", "In Ecco Homo he is careful to enlighten us concerning the precursors and prerequisites to the advent of this highest type, in referring to a certain passage in the Gay Science     In order to understand this type, we must first be quite clear in regard to the leading physiological condition on which it depends  this condition is what I call GREAT HEALTHINESS.", "I know not how to express my meaning more plainly or more personally than I have done already in one of the last chapters (Aphorism 382) of the fifth book of the ‘Gaya Scienza’.  We, the new, the nameless, the hard to understand,  it says there,  we firstlings of a yet untried future  we require for a new end also a new means, namely, a new healthiness, stronger, sharper, tougher, bolder and merrier than all healthiness hitherto.", "He whose soul longeth to experience the whole range of hitherto recognised values and desirabilities, and to circumnavigate all the coasts of this ideal ‘Mediterranean Sea’, who, from the adventures of his most personal experience, wants to know how it feels to be a conqueror, and discoverer of the ideal  as likewise how it is with the artist, the saint, the legislator, the sage, the scholar, the devotee, the prophet, and the godly non conformist of the old style   requires one thing above all for that purpose, GREAT HEALTHINESS  such healthiness as one not only possesses, but also constantly acquires and must acquire, because one unceasingly sacrifices it again, and must sacrifice it!  And now, after having been long on the way in this fashion, we Argonauts of the ideal, more courageous perhaps than prudent, and often enough shipwrecked and brought to grief, nevertheless dangerously healthy, always healthy again,  it would seem as if, in recompense for it all, that we have a still undiscovered country before us, the boundaries of which no one has yet seen, a beyond to all countries and corners of the ideal known hitherto, a world so over rich in the beautiful, the strange, the questionable, the frightful, and the divine, that our curiosity as well as our thirst for possession thereof, have got out of hand  alas!", "that nothing will now any longer satisfy us!    How could we still be content with THE MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY after such outlooks, and with such a craving in our conscience and consciousness?", "Sad enough; but it is unavoidable that we should look on the worthiest aims and hopes of the man of the present day with ill concealed amusement, and perhaps should no longer look at them.", "Another ideal runs on before us, a strange, tempting ideal full of danger, to which we should not like to persuade any one, because we do not so readily acknowledge any one’s RIGHT THERETO  the ideal of a spirit who plays naively (that is to say involuntarily and from overflowing abundance and power) with everything that has hitherto been called holy, good, intangible, or divine; to whom the loftiest conception which the people have reasonably made their measure of value, would already practically imply danger, ruin, abasement, or at least relaxation, blindness, or temporary self forgetfulness; the ideal of a humanly superhuman welfare and benevolence, which will often enough appear INHUMAN, for example, when put alongside of all past seriousness on earth, and alongside of all past solemnities in bearing, word, tone, look, morality, and pursuit, as their truest involuntary parody  and WITH which, nevertheless, perhaps THE GREAT SERIOUSNESS only commences, when the proper interrogative mark is set up, the fate of the soul changes, the hour hand moves, and tragedy begins...  Although the figure of Zarathustra and a large number of the leading thoughts in this work had appeared much earlier in the dreams and writings of the author, Thus Spake Zarathustra did not actually come into being until the month of August 1881 in Sils Maria; and it was the idea of the Eternal Recurrence of all things which finally induced my brother to set forth his new views in poetic language.", "In regard to his first conception of this idea, his autobiographical sketch, Ecce Homo, written in the autumn of 1888, contains the following passage     The fundamental idea of my work  namely, the Eternal Recurrence of all things  this highest of all possible formulae of a Yea saying philosophy, first occurred to me in August 1881.", "I made a note of the thought on a sheet of paper, with the postscript  6,000 feet beyond men and time!", "That day I happened to be wandering through the woods alongside of the lake of Silvaplana, and I halted beside a huge, pyramidal and towering rock not far from Surlei.", "It was then that the thought struck me.", "Looking back now, I find that exactly two months previous to this inspiration, I had had an omen of its coming in the form of a sudden and decisive alteration in my tastes  more particularly in music.", "It would even be possible to consider all ‘Zarathustra’ as a musical composition.", "At all events, a very necessary condition in its production was a renaissance in myself of the art of hearing.", "In a small mountain resort (Recoaro) near Vicenza, where I spent the spring of 1881, I and my friend and Maestro, Peter Gast  also one who had been born again  discovered that the phoenix music that hovered over us, wore lighter and brighter plumes than it had done theretofore.  During the month of August 1881 my brother resolved to reveal the teaching of the Eternal Recurrence, in dithyrambic and psalmodic form, through the mouth of Zarathustra.", "Among the notes of this period, we found a page on which is written the first definite plan of Thus Spake Zarathustra     MIDDAY AND ETERNITY.  GUIDE POSTS TO A NEW WAY OF LIVING.  Beneath this is written     Zarathustra born on lake Urmi; left his home in his thirtieth year, went into the province of Aria, and, during ten years of solitude in the mountains, composed the Zend Avesta.  The sun of knowledge stands once more at midday; and the serpent of eternity lies coiled in its light    It is YOUR time, ye midday brethren.  In that summer of 1881, my brother, after many years of steadily declining health, began at last to rally, and it is to this first gush of the recovery of his once splendid bodily condition that we owe not only The Gay Science, which in its mood may be regarded as a prelude to Zarathustra, but also Zarathustra itself.", "Just as he was beginning to recuperate his health, however, an unkind destiny brought him a number of most painful personal experiences.", "His friends caused him many disappointments, which were the more bitter to him, inasmuch as he regarded friendship as such a sacred institution; and for the first time in his life he realised the whole horror of that loneliness to which, perhaps, all greatness is condemned.", "But to be forsaken is something very different from deliberately choosing blessed loneliness.", "How he longed, in those days, for the ideal friend who would thoroughly understand him, to whom he would be able to say all, and whom he imagined he had found at various periods in his life from his earliest youth onwards.", "Now, however, that the way he had chosen grew ever more perilous and steep, he found nobody who could follow him  he therefore created a perfect friend for himself in the ideal form of a majestic philosopher, and made this creation the preacher of his gospel to the world.", "Whether my brother would ever have written Thus Spake Zarathustra  according to the first plan sketched in the summer of 1881, if he had not had the disappointments already referred to, is now an idle question; but perhaps where Zarathustra is concerned, we may also say with Master Eckhardt  The fleetest beast to bear you to perfection is suffering.  My brother writes as follows about the origin of the first part of Zarathustra   In the winter of 1882 83, I was living on the charming little Gulf of Rapallo, not far from Genoa, and between Chiavari and Cape Porto Fino.", "My health was not very good; the winter was cold and exceptionally rainy; and the small inn in which I lived was so close to the water that at night my sleep would be disturbed if the sea were high.", "These circumstances were surely the very reverse of favourable; and yet in spite of it all, and as if in demonstration of my belief that everything decisive comes to life in spite of every obstacle, it was precisely during this winter and in the midst of these unfavourable circumstances that my ‘Zarathustra’ originated.", "In the morning I used to start out in a southerly direction up the glorious road to Zoagli, which rises aloft through a forest of pines and gives one a view far out into the sea.", "In the afternoon, as often as my health permitted, I walked round the whole bay from Santa Margherita to beyond Porto Fino.", "This spot was all the more interesting to me, inasmuch as it was so dearly loved by the Emperor Frederick III.", "In the autumn of 1886 I chanced to be there again when he was revisiting this small, forgotten world of happiness for the last time.", "It was on these two roads that all ‘Zarathustra’ came to me, above all Zarathustra himself as a type;  I ought rather to say that it was on these walks that these ideas waylaid me.  The first part of Zarathustra was written in about ten days  that is to say, from the beginning to about the middle of February 1883.", "The last lines were written precisely in the hallowed hour when Richard Wagner gave up the ghost in Venice.  With the exception of the ten days occupied in composing the first part of this book, my brother often referred to this winter as the hardest and sickliest he had ever experienced.", "He did not, however, mean thereby that his former disorders were troubling him, but that he was suffering from a severe attack of influenza which he had caught in Santa Margherita, and which tormented him for several weeks after his arrival in Genoa.", "As a matter of fact, however, what he complained of most was his spiritual condition  that indescribable forsakenness  to which he gives such heartrending expression in Zarathustra.", "Even the reception which the first part met with at the hands of friends and acquaintances was extremely disheartening  for almost all those to whom he presented copies of the work misunderstood it.", "I found no one ripe for many of my thoughts; the case of ‘Zarathustra’ proves that one can speak with the utmost clearness, and yet not be heard by any one. My brother was very much discouraged by the feebleness of the response he was given, and as he was striving just then to give up the practice of taking hydrate of chloral  a drug he had begun to take while ill with influenza,  the following spring, spent in Rome, was a somewhat gloomy one for him.", "He writes about it as follows   I spent a melancholy spring in Rome, where I only just managed to live,  and this was no easy matter.", "This city, which is absolutely unsuited to the poet author of ‘Zarathustra’, and for the choice of which I was not responsible, made me inordinately miserable.", "I tried to leave it.", "I wanted to go to Aquila  the opposite of Rome in every respect, and actually founded in a spirit of enmity towards that city (just as I also shall found a city some day), as a memento of an atheist and genuine enemy of the Church  a person very closely related to me,  the great Hohenstaufen, the Emperor Frederick II.", "But Fate lay behind it all  I had to return again to Rome.", "In the end I was obliged to be satisfied with the Piazza Barberini, after I had exerted myself in vain to find an anti Christian quarter.", "I fear that on one occasion, to avoid bad smells as much as possible, I actually inquired at the Palazzo del Quirinale whether they could not provide a quiet room for a philosopher.", "In a chamber high above the Piazza just mentioned, from which one obtained a general view of Rome and could hear the fountains plashing far below, the loneliest of all songs was composed  ‘The Night Song’.", "About this time I was obsessed by an unspeakably sad melody, the refrain of which I recognised in the words, ‘dead through immortality.’  We remained somewhat too long in Rome that spring, and what with the effect of the increasing heat and the discouraging circumstances already described, my brother resolved not to write any more, or in any case, not to proceed with Zarathustra, although I offered to relieve him of all trouble in connection with the proofs and the publisher.", "When, however, we returned to Switzerland towards the end of June, and he found himself once more in the familiar and exhilarating air of the mountains, all his joyous creative powers revived, and in a note to me announcing the dispatch of some manuscript, he wrote as follows  I have engaged a place here for three months  forsooth, I am the greatest fool to allow my courage to be sapped from me by the climate of Italy.", "Now and again I am troubled by the thought  WHAT NEXT?", "My ‘future’ is the darkest thing in the world to me, but as there still remains a great deal for me to do, I suppose I ought rather to think of doing this than of my future, and leave the rest to THEE and the gods.  The second part of Zarathustra was written between the 26th of June and the 6th July.", "This summer, finding myself once more in the sacred place where the first thought of ‘Zarathustra’ flashed across my mind, I conceived the second part.", "Ten days sufficed.", "Neither for the second, the first, nor the third part, have I required a day longer.  He often used to speak of the ecstatic mood in which he wrote Zarathustra; how in his walks over hill and dale the ideas would crowd into his mind, and how he would note them down hastily in a note book from which he would transcribe them on his return, sometimes working till midnight.", "He says in a letter to me  You can have no idea of the vehemence of such composition, and in Ecce Homo (autumn 1888) he describes as follows with passionate enthusiasm the incomparable mood in which he created Zarathustra       Has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct notion of what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration?", "If not, I will describe it.", "If one had the smallest vestige of superstition in one, it would hardly be possible to set aside completely the idea that one is the mere incarnation, mouthpiece or medium of an almighty power.", "The idea of revelation in the sense that something becomes suddenly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and accuracy, which profoundly convulses and upsets one  describes simply the matter of fact.", "One hears  one does not seek; one takes  one does not ask who gives  a thought suddenly flashes up like lightning, it comes with necessity, unhesitatingly  I have never had any choice in the matter.", "There is an ecstasy such that the immense strain of it is sometimes relaxed by a flood of tears, along with which one’s steps either rush or involuntarily lag, alternately.", "There is the feeling that one is completely out of hand, with the very distinct consciousness of an endless number of fine thrills and quiverings to the very toes;  there is a depth of happiness in which the painfullest and gloomiest do not operate as antitheses, but as conditioned, as demanded in the sense of necessary shades of colour in such an overflow of light.", "There is an instinct for rhythmic relations which embraces wide areas of forms (length, the need of a wide embracing rhythm, is almost the measure of the force of an inspiration, a sort of counterpart to its pressure and tension).", "Everything happens quite involuntarily, as if in a tempestuous outburst of freedom, of absoluteness, of power and divinity.", "The involuntariness of the figures and similes is the most remarkable thing; one loses all perception of what constitutes the figure and what constitutes the simile; everything seems to present itself as the readiest, the correctest and the simplest means of expression.", "It actually seems, to use one of Zarathustra’s own phrases, as if all things came unto one, and would fain be similes  ‘Here do all things come caressingly to thy talk and flatter thee, for they want to ride upon thy back.", "On every simile dost thou here ride to every truth.", "Here fly open unto thee all being’s words and word cabinets; here all being wanteth to become words, here all becoming wanteth to learn of thee how to talk.’ This is MY experience of inspiration.", "I do not doubt but that one would have to go back thousands of years in order to find some one who could say to me  It is mine also!    In the autumn of 1883 my brother left the Engadine for Germany and stayed there a few weeks.", "In the following winter, after wandering somewhat erratically through Stresa, Genoa, and Spezia, he landed in Nice, where the climate so happily promoted his creative powers that he wrote the third part of Zarathustra.", "In the winter, beneath the halcyon sky of Nice, which then looked down upon me for the first time in my life, I found the third ‘Zarathustra’  and came to the end of my task; the whole having occupied me scarcely a year.", "Many hidden corners and heights in the landscapes round about Nice are hallowed to me by unforgettable moments.", "That decisive chapter entitled ‘Old and New Tables’ was composed in the very difficult ascent from the station to Eza  that wonderful Moorish village in the rocks.", "My most creative moments were always accompanied by unusual muscular activity.", "The body is inspired  let us waive the question of the ‘soul.’ I might often have been seen dancing in those days.", "Without a suggestion of fatigue I could then walk for seven or eight hours on end among the hills.", "I slept well and laughed well  I was perfectly robust and patient.  As we have seen, each of the three parts of Zarathustra was written, after a more or less short period of preparation, in about ten days.", "The composition of the fourth part alone was broken by occasional interruptions.", "The first notes relating to this part were written while he and I were staying together in Zurich in September 1884.", "In the following November, while staying at Mentone, he began to elaborate these notes, and after a long pause, finished the manuscript at Nice between the end of January and the middle of February 1885.", "My brother then called this part the fourth and last; but even before, and shortly after it had been privately printed, he wrote to me saying that he still intended writing a fifth and sixth part, and notes relating to these parts are now in my possession.", "This fourth part (the original MS.", "of which contains this note  Only for my friends, not for the public) is written in a particularly personal spirit, and those few to whom he presented a copy of it, he pledged to the strictest secrecy concerning its contents.", "He often thought of making this fourth part public also, but doubted whether he would ever be able to do so without considerably altering certain portions of it.", "At all events he resolved to distribute this manuscript production, of which only forty copies were printed, only among those who had proved themselves worthy of it, and it speaks eloquently of his utter loneliness and need of sympathy in those days, that he had occasion to present only seven copies of his book according to this resolution.", "Already at the beginning of this history I hinted at the reasons which led my brother to select a Persian as the incarnation of his ideal of the majestic philosopher.", "His reasons, however, for choosing Zarathustra of all others to be his mouthpiece, he gives us in the following words   People have never asked me, as they should have done, what the name Zarathustra precisely means in my mouth, in the mouth of the first Immoralist; for what distinguishes that philosopher from all others in the past is the very fact that he was exactly the reverse of an immoralist.", "Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle between good and evil the essential wheel in the working of things.", "The translation of morality into the metaphysical, as force, cause, end in itself, was HIS work.", "But the very question suggests its own answer.", "Zarathustra CREATED the most portentous error, MORALITY, consequently he should also be the first to PERCEIVE that error, not only because he has had longer and greater experience of the subject than any other thinker  all history is the experimental refutation of the theory of the so called moral order of things   the more important point is that Zarathustra was more truthful than any other thinker.", "In his teaching alone do we meet with truthfulness upheld as the highest virtue  i.e.", "  the reverse of the COWARDICE of the ‘idealist’ who flees from reality.", "Zarathustra had more courage in his body than any other thinker before or after him.", "To tell the truth and TO AIM STRAIGHT  that is the first Persian virtue.", "Am I understood?...", "The overcoming of morality through itself  through truthfulness, the overcoming of the moralist through his opposite  THROUGH ME    that is what the name Zarathustra means in my mouth.

Do I then rest on dry land?  asked Zarathustra, laughing.  The waves around thy mountain, answered the soothsayer, rise and rise, the waves of great distress and affliction  they will soon raise thy bark also and carry thee away.  Thereupon was Zarathustra silent and wondered.  Dost thou still hear nothing? continued the soothsayer  doth it not rush and roar out of the depth?  Zarathustra was silent once more and listened  then heard he a long, long cry, which the abysses threw to one another and passed on; for none of them wished to retain it  so evil did it sound.", "Thou ill announcer, said Zarathustra at last, that is a cry of distress, and the cry of a man; it may come perhaps out of a black sea.", "But what doth human distress matter to me!", "My last sin which hath been reserved for me,  knowest thou what it is called?    PITY! answered the soothsayer from an overflowing heart, and raised both his hands aloft  O Zarathustra, I have come that I may seduce thee to thy last sin!

But thou knowest it, certainly, answered the soothsayer warmly, why dost thou conceal thyself?", "It is THE HIGHER MAN that crieth for thee!  The higher man? cried Zarathustra, horror stricken  what wanteth HE?", "What wanteth HE?", "The higher man!", "What wanteth he here?  and his skin covered with perspiration.", "The soothsayer, however, did not heed Zarathustra’s alarm, but listened and listened in the downward direction.", "When, however, it had been still there for a long while, he looked behind, and saw Zarathustra standing trembling.", "O Zarathustra, he began, with sorrowful voice, thou dost not stand there like one whose happiness maketh him giddy  thou wilt have to dance lest thou tumble down!", "But although thou shouldst dance before me, and leap all thy side leaps, no one may say unto me  ‘Behold, here danceth the last joyous man!’  In vain would any one come to this height who sought HIM here  caves would he find, indeed, and back caves, hiding places for hidden ones; but not lucky mines, nor treasure chambers, nor new gold veins of happiness.", "Happiness  how indeed could one find happiness among such buried alive and solitary ones!", "Must I yet seek the last happiness on the Happy Isles, and far away among forgotten seas?", "But all is alike, nothing is worth while, no seeking is of service, there are no longer any Happy Isles!

With those words Zarathustra turned around to depart.", "Then said the soothsayer  O Zarathustra, thou art a rogue!", "I know it well  thou wouldst fain be rid of me!", "Rather wouldst thou run into the forest and lay snares for evil beasts!", "But what good will it do thee?", "In the evening wilt thou have me again  in thine own cave will I sit, patient and heavy like a block  and wait for thee!  So be it! shouted back Zarathustra, as he went away  and what is mine in my cave belongeth also unto thee, my guest!", "Shouldst thou however find honey therein, well!", "just lick it up, thou growling bear, and sweeten thy soul!", "For in the evening we want both to be in good spirits;    In good spirits and joyful, because this day hath come to an end!", "And thou thyself shalt dance to my lays, as my dancing bear.", "Thou dost not believe this?", "Thou shakest thy head?", "Well!", "Cheer up, old bear!", "But I also  am a soothsayer.
